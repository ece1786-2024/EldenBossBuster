in this eldering video i'm going to be showing you why greatswords are the best weapon in eldon ring this is the first video of our new series where we go through each weapon type and show you what you can do with each weapon and why you may or may not use those weapons in your bill in this video we're going to be showing you each of the move sets of the different 21 great swords in the game as well as their weapon skills and talking about the pros and cons of each of these great swords helping you to make a decision as to whether or not it's something you want to use in your build before we get into each weapon though the first thing i want to talk about is great sword styles of play in my opinion there are really three different styles of play available to the great sword and these are jump attack power stanced using a weapon skill with either a single grade sword or using a single greatsword and shield and using that weapon skill or using a block counter playstyle or playing as a spellblade where you're using a greatsword in one hand and a staff or seal in the other when selecting a great sword you really need to identify which style of play you want to use with these in my opinion out of the three jump attack power stance is probably the easiest to play and it's extremely powerful behind it is probably the spellblade in terms of what you can do because you have spells at your disposal in terms of things you can do you have more in your arsenal with ranged and melee attacks and probably the last one is using some sort of weapon skill or a block counter build that also uses a weapon skill as far as the pros and cons go of great swords in general they have very high single attack damage and they can be power stanced more easily than colossal weapons due to lower weight and they generally have very low requirements that can be two-handed very easily in most cases however they have lower dps than some weapons due to their slower swings and they have higher stamina consumption than some weapons and many of them are not found until much later in the game making it difficult to make the build you want early on so jumping into the great swords themselves the first up is alabaster lord sword this weapon shares the default moveset of many other great swords and deals both physical and magic damage and it is the lightest greatsword in ellen ring-wang eight and requires some points in strength and dexterity and intelligence in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it has the highest physical damage of all magic or cold infused greatswords as well as unique great swords that deal magic damage it deals plus 20 damage to gravity type enemies these are enemies that have like some sort of gravity about them like the other lord alabaster lord type enemies and a couple other enemy types it's the lightest great sword in the game at 8 making it very easy to wield or even dual wield it has the best strength scaling of all magic dealing greatswords and alabaster lord's pull gives you increased poise once the sword is plunged into the ground making it rather easy to use if you can get the timing down and you can acquire two of these in a single playthrough without needing one dropped by another player when it comes to cons for the alabaster lord sword it's slightly shorter than most other great swords it has the second lowest magic damage of all magic and cold infused grade swords as well as unique greatswords that deal magic damage its pull is one of the lower damage dealing weapon skills and you cannot change the ash of war and these two versions of this weapon or two copies of this weapon are acquired very late into the game in the lake of rot and the yellow annex tunnel so you won't be able to play with them until much later in the game in summary the alabaster lord sword is in a weird place because despite having the best strength scaling and physical damage of all magic healing greatswords it has terrible dexterity scaling and intelligence scaling and deals very little magic damage this makes it much better suited for a pure strength build than any sort of hybrid strength intelligence build however the damage of this weapon is outperformed by other strength focused greatswords like the heavy iron greatsword and heavy gargoyle's greatsword and those weapons can be buffed so if you're playing a strength based greatsword build this probably won't be factored in much for you the sweet spot of damage for this weapon is 50 strength as you only gain 76 attack rating from 50 to 99 strength and investing points into intelligence and dexterity is not recommended since you get very poor returns when you do this however despite these things if you still want to use this weapon in your playthrough because you can get two of them i would suggest possibly power stancing them since they're very light this means you won't need as much equip load in order to use them or using a great shield for block counter sort of build since you'll need to invest heavily in strength and the requirements for great shields are typically high strength and that makes it a good combo for that as well moving along to our next great sword which is ordovis's great sword this weapon also shares the default moveset of many other great swords and deals both physical and holy damage it's one of the heaviest greatswords in eldring weighing 12 and requires some points in strength dexterity and faith in order to will the pros of this weapon are that it has the highest attack rating of all heavy infused greatswords about 25 percent of which is holy damage ordova's vortex the weapon skill is very high damaging and has an aoe and it's not hard to pull off most of the time due to the poise it provides ordovas's vortex can be boosted with god-free icons since it can be charged allowing you to boost its damage higher than some other unique weapon skills because not all of them can be the cons of this weapon are that it has rather high requirements as far as greatswords are concerned the faith scaling is absolutely terrible meaning you won't gain much more holy damage than what you get if you have just enough to meet the faith requirements of the weapon so i don't recommend investing in faith if you're using this weapon it's acquired fairly far into the game at ariza hiro's grave near the royal capital and you cannot change the ash of war on it additionally despite having a scaling at max upgrade it actually has worse damage from scaling than all other b-scaling heavy infused great swords and finally it's a poor weapon in ng plus and beyond due to scaling issues and even though it deals an incredible amount of damage in ng that damage is going to taper off as you go further and further into ng pluses because there's really no way to increase the damage very high after that first playthrough in summary ordovic's greatsword is a fantastic greatsword to use if you're playing a strength based build but points into faith barely benefit this weapon's attack rating making it far less useful than it would appear to strength faith builds however if you're using the claw mark seal you can still use incantations effectively since it gains scaling from both strength and faith the sweet spot for damage with this sword is about 50 strength and 25 faith you only gain about 100 attack rating from 50 to 99 strength and faith scaling is poor in general past 20. however 25 faith will allow you to use golden vowel which is one of the best buffs in the game so i recommend getting that high if you're going to use this weapon if you're going to use this weapon i recommend leading into the weapon skill or dovis's vortex as it is extremely strong and either two-handing it or using a great shield with it next up we have the inseparable sword this sword shares a unique two-handed r1 moveset with the knight's greatsword and banish knight's greatsword and deals both physical and holy damage it has an average weight for a greatsword and elder ring weighing 10 and requires some points in strength dexterity and faith in order to use some of the pros of this weapon are that it deals plus 20 damage to undead type enemies and prevents skeletons from reviving even when on buff it has the second highest holy damage of all sacred infused or unique great swords behind the golden order greatsword but only at very high faith and otherwise it's outperformed by the sacred iron greatsword by a tiny amount sacred blade when used actually boosts the holy damage of this weapon over and above all other great swords that deal holy damage at very high faith at 80 faith it has the highest attack rating of all holy damage dealing greatswords if you've not invested in strength or dexterity much and over 50 percent of this damage is holy some of the cons are that it has one of the lowest physical damage dealing greatswords that also deal holy damage you cannot change the ash of war on this weapon it's acquired very late into the game and can be missed in the prince of death's throne it has higher stat requirements than many great swords and it also has poor strength and dexterity scaling compared to some other holy damage dealing greatswords and the holy damage in general is not a great damage type late in the game as many of the bosses in the game tend to resist it conclusion the inseparable sword is mostly unremarkable not only is it easy to miss getting but the sacred iron greatsword outperforms it and damage most of the game and you can use many different ashes of war on the iron greatsword additionally sacred blade is a much better early game ash of war than late game making it mostly irrelevant by the point you acquired this weapon however its innate ability to prevent the resurrection of undead and bonus damage against them is nice for some areas of the game only use this weapon over the sacred iron greed sword if you intend to push your faith to 80 or higher or if you want the bonuses for a specific section of undead enemies or you cannot be bothered to farm the iron greatsword because of the poor dexterity and strength scaling of this weapon it'll peak near the end of your first playthrough and will just continue to drop off an effectiveness from that point onward making it not ideal for ng plus and beyond but if you insist on using this great sword i would pair it with a sacred iron greatsword for a jump attack playstyle or use it with something like the erd tree seal and make a build that can also cast incantations effectively next up we come to the gargoyle's black blade and this shares the default moveset of many other great swords and deals both physical and holy damage it's a heavier greatsword and elden ring weighing 11.5 and requires some points in strength dexterity and faith in order to wield some pros about this weapon are that it has the highest attack rating of holy damage dealing greatswords infused and unique at 50 faith and 50 strength at minimum requirements and max upgrade it has 695 attack rating which is extremely high corpse wax cutter deals 100 holy damage allowing you to boost it with the sacred scorpion charm and holy shroud and crack tear more effectively than some other weapon skills corpse wax cutter can one-shot most regular enemies from decent range if set up properly some of the cons of this weapon are that it has poor scaling that makes it much better earlier on in the game than later even though it's still strong late game you cannot change the ash of war on this weapon the weapon skill corpse wax cutter deals less damage than taker's flame which is very similar and found on the blasphemous blade and that also heals you when this one does not corpse wax cutter is expensive fp wise for the damage that it deals it can also be difficult to acquire early on since you must defeat the black blade kindred boss and kalid in order to receive it and that can be kind of hard to do for lower level players conclusion black blade does exceptional damage for a very little stat investment making it stronger early on in the game when you're much lower level and where enemies are much less resistant to holy damage later on in the game you won't gain much damage from your investment and enemy resistances to holy are the worst on some of the toughest bosses in eldon ring if you manage to begin the game as a confessor you could use this weapon as early as level 21 if you could defeat the black blade kindred making you an absolute beast in lower level content or pvp if you intend to reach higher levels with it you'd ideally aim for about 50 strength and 50 faith which will still put you ahead of every other holy damage grade sword and total attack rating and actually even more damage than the blasphemous blade if you don't put any points into dexterity what's really great about the gargoyle's black blade is that you can use this weapon in any of the three play styles i mentioned at the beginning of the video because of its ideal stat spread i used it in my blasphemous hero build for example which focused on power stance jump attacks and weapon skills but you could also spell cast with the claw mark seal effectively or use a great shield and one-handed if you want to next up is the sword of milos sword of milo shares a unique r2 with the death's poker and deals totally physical damage it has an average weight for a great sword and elden ring weighing 10 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the pros of sword of milos are that it restores 5 fp per kill while held in either hand it's one of three great swords that applies bleed build up with each hit it has very good quality scaling make it one of the best quality scaling grade swords in eldon ring tied with banished knight's greatsword but behind death's poker and blasphemous blade quality scaling allows it to be more viable and ng plus playthroughs you can buff your own damage with frika milos while also debuffing enemies and the ability has decent poise at the same time it does 100 physical damage which is usually less resisted than elemental damage types and finally roar medallion buffs r2 attacks while under the effects of shriek of milos some cons of this weapon are that the personal damage buff has a rather short duration at 20 seconds you cannot change the ash of war this weapon nor can you buff it with grease or spells unlike the banished knights greatsword it's also acquired fairly late into the game by defeating dung eater so you're not going to be using this for a huge chunk of the game in summary unless you build for high poise in order to use the buffed r2 combo without interruption this great sword seems meant to be paired with another great sword for jump attack combos ideally one that also has bleed on it the fp recovery per kill alone makes it a solid choice for an off hand in this style using another great sword in the main hand that has a more effective weapon skill trichomeless can be difficult to use but is extremely powerful when executed as it not only adds 85 points of physical damage for 20 seconds but also debuffs enemies reducing their resistances by 15 for 30 seconds the sweet spot for stat spread seems to be around 55 strength and 55 dexterity but because this great sword has quality scaling it will remain effective at much higher stats than many other great swords next we have the morey executioner's sword the moray executioner sword has a unique r2 that attacks vertically instead of horizontally and deals both physical and magic damage it's one of the heavier greatswords in elden ring weighing 11.5 and requires some points into strength dexterity and arcane in order to will the pros of this weapon are that aoj's dancing blade is a fantastic weapon skill that can absolutely melt enemies and bosses very quickly ao chad's dancing blade can be buffed by godfrey icon wing sword insignia rotten wing sword insignia and millicent's prosthesis easily really cranking its damage it also has decent scaling that makes it more akin to a quality build though one stat is arcane instead of dexterity when it comes to cons it has the third lowest magic damage of any great sword that deals magic damage including cold infusions strength and arcade have very little synergy outside of this weapon making it difficult to hybrid this weapon into a caster melee build it isn't found until much later in the game by defeating elmer of the briar at the top of the shaded castle and lastly it has rather high stat requirements for a greatsword in summary the moray executioner sword is in the middle of the pack in terms of overall attack rating from magic damage dealing great swords since it deals predominantly physical damage it doesn't take as good advantage of talismans and buffs that increase magic damage unlike many other great swords that deal magic damage since there isn't much synergy between strength and arcane it's difficult to use this weapon and hybrid it into some sort of caster that uses the dragon communion seal this is because you'd also need points in faith to be able to cast incantations which would mean spreading points between strength arcane faith mind and vigor minimally and that's not including endurance if you want to have a higher equip load the main reason to use moire executioner's sword in my opinion is its weapon skill aoj's dancing blade that can often one or two shot most enemies and even some bosses because each rotation of the skill counts as a hit talismans like winged sword insignia increase its damage with each rotation resulting in huge damage numbers and it can also be charged which means that it can make use of god-free icon which isn't typical of weapon skills either play this weapon two-handed or one-handed with a shield for best results you should aim for 50 strength and 50 arcane in order to get the most from this weapon and note that it's still okay scaling past this point in strength making it more viable for successive playthroughs than many other weapons next up is death's poker death smoker shares a unique r2 with the sword of milos and deals physical and magic damage it's extremely lightweight for a greatsword and eldering weighing 8.5 and requires some points in strength dexterity and intelligence in order to wield the pros of death's poker are that it builds frostbite with every hit as well as its weapons skill it has rather low requirements for a unique grade sword it has the third highest physical damage of all magic damage dealing greatswords behind alabaster lord sword and maree executioner sword it has the second highest potential attack rating of all quality scaling greatswords if you factor in intelligence scaling it can be acquired somewhat early on in the game as far as greatswords are concerned ghost flame ignition is one of the best greatsword weapon skills in the game and ghost flame ignition deals 100 magic damage allowing you to boost its damage significantly with things like magic scorpion charm magic shroud and crack tear and terra magica as far as its cons it has the lowest magic damage of all magic damage dealing great swords ghost flame ignition its weapon skill scales with intelligence and deals 100 magic damage but the weapon has terrible intelligence scaling conclusion for such a lightweight greatsword death's poker packs a serious punch not only a normal attack rating but also with its weapon skill ghost flame ignition it's a shame not more of its attack power was magic damage since it's highly likely you'll use effects that boost magic damage with this weapon and its regular attacks will not take much advantage of them ideally you'd put 50 points into strength and 50 in a dexterity when using this weapon in order to get the most damage out of it but 20 points in intelligence are also recommended in order to use terra magica this spell boosts magic damage by 35 while standing inside it which will only amplify ghost flame ignition even further i'd suggest playing with this weapon with a shield leaning into ghost slam ignition when you can or dual wielding greatswords utilizing jump attacks with this weapon in your main hand for easy ghost flame usage perhaps pairing it with something like sword of milos or another weapon that deals magic damage the next greatsword we're going to take a look at is hellfin steeple health and steeple shares the default moveset of many other great swords and deals both physical and magic damage it's one of the heavier greatswords in elden ring weighing 11.5 and requires some points in strength dexterity and intelligence in order to wield this weapon has the highest total attack rating of all magic damage dealing greatswords and can boost its damage even higher with its weapons skill ruinous ghost flame has a rather fast cast speed and makes attacks inflict frostbite it's better than many great swords in ng plus and beyond due to decent strength and intelligence scaling when it comes to cons one of them is that its intelligence scaling is not as good as darkmoon greatsword or many other magic infused greatswords the duration of ruinous ghost flame is rather short at only 30 seconds you cannot change the ash of war on this weapon and it's found extremely late into the game in summary health and steeple has exceptional attack rating and has a nearly perfect split in terms of physical and magic damage if strength and intelligence are equal however it has average intelligence scaling compared to other magic damage dealing greatswords and there are better options if you plan to go past 50 intelligence including darkmoon greatsword gargoyle's magic sword magic iron grade sword and magic bastard sword the ideal stats read for this weapon is around 50 strength and 50 intelligence which is where the weapon shines against any other greatsword with the same stat spread going much above this yields diminishing returns health and steeple excels at dealing damage with regular attacks more than anything due to its high base damage decent strength and intelligence scaling and because it can buff itself further increasing its damage and adding frostbite build up to the weapon it doesn't have an offensive weapon skill and because other great swords will outperform it if you take the spellblade route of increasing intelligence health and steeple is ideal in a dual wheel jump attack setup or potentially with a one-handed shield setup you'll have to rebuff this weapon often so make sure to keep it in your main hand next up is the infamous blasphemous blade the blasphemous blade shares the default moveset of many other greatswords and deals both physical and fire damage it's the heaviest greatsword in elegant ring weighing 13.5 and requires some points in strength dexterity and faith in order to wield the pros of this weapon of which there are many are that it has the highest potential attack rating of all faith scaling greatswords if you place points into faith strength and dexterity it's one of the most powerful weapon skills in the game and taker's flame which not only does incredible damage but also heals on hit for 10 of your max hp plus 150 hp it also heals four percent of your max hp and plus 40 hp per kill as long as the weapon is in either hand taker's flame does pure fire damage making it easily buffed with things like fire scorpion charm and flame shrouded cracked tear and lastly since the weapon does both physical and fire damage on regular attacks it benefits doubly from flame grant me strength some cons are that taker's flame is very expensive at 30 fp taker's flame only scales with faith though blasphemous blade actually has modest faith scaling it has high requirements for a great sword and it has found a good ways into the game though not as far as some other great swords and lastly it's extremely heavy for a great sword conclusion blasphemous blade is one of the strongest weapons in eldon ring not only because taker's flame hits extremely hard when set up properly but also because it can hit multiple enemies at a good distance and heals you for each one struck and each one kill if you're using the blasphemous blade then you should be using taker's flame often particularly during boss encounters where you're wasting three quarters of the potential of this weapon despite appearances blasphemous blade actually scales better with dexterity and strength than it does faith making it a poor weapon choice for a spellblade sword of build and more suited for a sword and board playstyle or dual grade source there are better great swords for the high faith route and taker's flame is a far better use of fp than spells if you're using blasphemous blade anyhow the ideal stat spread for this build would be somewhere around 50 strength 50 dexterity and 50 fate this is hard to do in a single playthrough but that's one of the reasons this is such a strong weapon it will continue to get stronger in ng plus making it viable for multiple playthroughs next up is the legendary darkmoon greatsword the darkman greatsword has a unique r2 and deals physical and magic damage it has an average weight for a greatsword an elden ring weighing 10 and requires some points in strength dexterity and a lot of points in intelligence in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it causes frost buildup on attacks and has the highest magic damage of all magic damage great swords at 80 intelligence and second highest overall attack rating at 80 intelligence with only minimum requirements into strength and dexterity behind the magic iron greatsword moonlight greatsword has good range and high stagger when charged moonlight greatsword deals 100 magic damage allowing it to be enhanced by magic scorpion charm terra magica and magic crowding cracked tears substantially the cons of this weapon are that it has extremely high requirements to wield and it's located very far into the game additionally it has to be buffed to be used efficiently every 60 seconds which can be kind of annoying in summary the darkmoon greatsword is one of the best two great swords in elden ring if you plan to make a spellblade build not only does it deal solid damage at high intelligence levels but intelligence directly affects the damage of moonlight greatswords waves while also increasing your sorcery scaling and because moonlight greatswords waves are pure magic damage they benefit directly from things i mentioned previously that most intelligence mage would use anyway like magic scorpion charm one of the best things about moonlight greatsword is its ability to stagger enemies at a distance where you are less likely to get hit if you're using charged r2s and if you're a spellblade you can combine this with great lead phalanx for even faster staggered buildup the best way to play this build is no doubt in some build that uses sorcery since not every build will benefit from such high intelligence the darkmoon greatsword has poor strength and dexterity scaling and the waves of moonlight greatsword do not benefit from these stats either grab carrion regal's scepter and go to town the last of the unique great swords is the sacred relic sword the sacred relic sword shares the default moveset of many other great swords and deals both physical and holy damage it's one of the heavier great swords in ellen ring weighing 11 and requires some points in strength dexterity and faith in order to wield some pros of this weapon are that wave of gold is an absolutely devastating weapon skilled and arguably one of the best in the game wave of gold deals 100 holy damage allowing it to be increased significantly with things like sacred scorpion charm and holy shroud and crack tier and it also has the highest attack rating of all king scaling greatswords the cons of this weapon are that it's found at the end of the game by defeating elton beast making this an ng plus weapon it has average faith scaling but wave of gold's damage is increased with points into faith not dexterity or strength it has less than average strength scaling meaning that you don't gain much damage when two handing it it does the second lowest holy damage of all holy damage dealing greatswords behind or dovah's greatsword it has lower physical damage than all other keen scaling greatswords wave of gold does not prevent undead resurrection though it really should and lastly it has high stat requirements for a greatsword conclusion sacred relics sword while extremely powerful because of its weapon skill wave of gold is otherwise unremarkable you cannot even acquire this weapon until you defeat eldon beast meaning that you'll likely only use this weapon in ng plus and beyond unless you skip lots of optional content on the way that you planned on doing later you'd ideally use this weapon with about 55 dexterity and 50 faith in order to get your best bang for your buck increasing your strength and ng plus to further boost damage because you ideally wouldn't have that much strength your damage when two hitting this weapon won't increase much making this a much better weapon to be one-handed in some sort of dual grade sword setup again low strength initially means that you likely won't use a great shield either sword of milos or blasphemous blade make good counterparts for dual wield setup not only because of the passive fp or passive hp they provide but also because they have similar scaling living along to our non-unique great swords the first one is the bastard sword the bastard storage shares the default moveset of many other great swords and deals physical damage it's one of the lightest great swords in eldon ring weighing nine and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield some pros of this weapon are that it can be acquired very early on in the game from the nomadic merchant on the eastern side of weaving peninsula it has a very low stat requirement and can be even two-handed with 11 strength it can be outfitted with many different ashes of war and has good strength scaling when using heavy cold poison or blood infusions its cons are that it's in the middle of the pack in nearly every scenario in terms of infusions conclusion the biggest plus points of this weapon are that you can acquire it early on and it will perform in the upper middle of the pack no matter what build you try to create with it giving it a lot of versatility if you've already upgraded this weapon and are short on smithing stones then i suggest continuing to use it but if you're working on a specialized build and haven't even acquired one yet i suggest looking at better alternatives next up we have the claymore the claymore has a unique r2 thrust and rolling r1 thrust and deals physical damage it's one of the lightest great swords in eldon ring wang 9 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield when it comes to the prose for the claymore it can be acquired early on in the game from a chest in castle mourn it has very low stat requirements and can even be two-handed with 11 strength it can be outfitted with many different ashes of war lion's claw is an excellent ash of war that you won't be able to get until it weighs further into the game its unique thrust r2 has very good reach allowing you to hit enemies you might otherwise miss the cons of this greatsword are that its damage is in the middle of the pack in nearly every scenario conclusion really the only reason to use this greatsword over others is its unique r2 that allows you to catch enemies at longer ranges or because of the ash of war lion's claw which would normally take much longer to acquire consider using the axe and spear talismans with this weapon to take full advantage of charged r2 thrusts next up is the iron greatsword the iron greatsword shares the default moveset of many other greatswords and deals physical damage it is one of the heaviest great swords in eldon ring-wang-12 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield some pros of this weapon are that it has higher base physical damage than every other greatsword and ellen ring it's near the top of the pack in every possible infusion making it a great choice if you're unsure exactly which great sword to use or if you want to try a variety of builds but don't want to farm a lot of upgrade materials it has very low stat requirements and can be even two-handed with 12 strength it can be outfitted with many different ashes of war the downsides of this weapon are that it's not found until much further into the game in the lindell royal capital or even further at mecca's hallowed tree it can also take a very long time to farm especially if you want two of them summary the iron greed sword is the best non-unique greatsword and alden ring outperforming nearly every other non-unique greatsword in just about every infusion possible and in some cases unique greatswords as well you cannot acquire it until you reach the royal capital and conform the misbegotten enemies there which can be a serious pain in the butt to do because there are only two and neither are near a side of grace however if you manage to farm one you'll have a fantastic offhand greatsword for just about any dual greatsword setup or a great main hand greatsword if you decide to lean into some of the strong ashes of war and elder ring like flame of the red mains or lion's claw next up is the lord sworn's great sword the lordshorn's greatsword shares the default moveset of many other greatswords and deals physical damage it's one of the lightest greatswords in elden ring wang 9 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it's the earliest attainable greatsword found in the gatefront runes in a chest it has higher critical rating than nearly every other greatsword in the game it has very low stat requirements and can be even two-handed with 11 strength and it can be outfitted with many different ashes of war its cons are that it is in the bottom middle of the pack in nearly every infusion conclusion the best reason to use the lord swarn's great sword is because you can do so from the earliest moments of the game however it doesn't take about an hour to find either the claymore or bastard sword naturally and within minutes if you already know their location even though this weapon has higher critical than every other greatsword except the sacred relic sword its overall damage is low enough that you'd still do more damage from critical hits with other great swords next up is the knights greatsword knight's greatsword shares a unique two-handed r1 moveset with the banished knights greatsword and the inseparable sword and deals physical damage it has an average weight for a greatsword in eldon ring weighing 10 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that i can be acquired quite early in the game from godric knights and limgrave mausoleum knights or cuckoo knights and learning of the lakes it has one of the highest two attack rating greatswords you can get relatively early in the game with a bit of farming with a banished knight's greatsword being the other it has very low stat requirements and can be two-handed with 11 strength and lastly it can be outfitted with many different ashes of war the cons of this weapon are that it might take a while to farm one or longer if you want to and also that it is outperformed by the banished knights greatsword in just about every case so there's not really a lot of point in farming this weapon if you can farm that one instead conclusion the knights grade sword is the strongest early game greatsword that you can acquire without defeating a single boss if you're looking for low-level cooperation or just want the highest attack rating you can get on a greatsword as quickly as possible then the knight's greatsword is the one for you next up is the banish knights greatsword the vanish knight's greatsword shares a unique two-handed r1 move set with the knights greatsword as we just mentioned and the inseparable sword and deals physical damage it has an average weight for a greatsword and eleanor ring weighing 10 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it drops relatively early on in an alden ring from banished knights wielding them it is also one of the two highest attack rating greatswords you can get early on in the game with a bit of farming with the knight's greatsword being the other it has very low stat requirements and can even be two-handed with 12 strength it can also be outfitted with many different ashes of war the downsides are that it can take a while to farm particularly if you want two of them summary the banished night's greatsword is the king of early game greatswords and is worth farming if you want to be as strong as you possibly can early on however if you've already used most of your upgrade materials on another great sword like the bastard sword or claymore and you haven't unlocked ways to purchase more it's probably not worth doing since you can replace it with an iron grade sword for even more damage later on next up is the forked grade sword the forked greatsword shares the default moveset of many other great swords and deals physical damage it's one of the lightest great swords in eldon ring wang 9 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it is one of three greatswords that builds up bleed with each hit it can be found sooner than the flamberg since it drops from imp enemies that wield it it's great for status effect oriented builds since you can add frostbite or poison to it as well you can also get two in a single playthrough without needing one drop from another player the cons of this weapon are that it has a relatively low attack rating compared to other grade swords it deals less damage than the flamburge in nearly every case and that also sets bleeding and it can also be very difficult to farm especially if you want to conclusion even though the forked greatsword has a lower attack rating than most other greatswords the fact that you can trigger hemorrhage with it makes it much more deadly than it would first appear however it is more effective in boss encounters where you are more likely to trigger hemorrhage before your target outright dies than it is out in the lands between where you can kill most things in one or two hits anyway if you can be bothered to farm one then you should consider farming a second one or pairing it with a flamberg for a jump attack playstyle that also applies hemorrhage and possibly frostbite or poison as well next up is the flamburge the flamboyant shares the default moveset of many other great swords and deals physical damage it has an average weight for a greatsword an ellen ring weighing 10 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it's one of three greatswords that builds up bleed with each hit and it can be found earlier than the vast majority of greatswords located inside red main castle and it's also great for status effect oriented build since you can add frostbite or poison to it as well and it has the best scaling of all kiana infused greatswords the downside of this weapon is that it has lower attack rating than just about all other greatswords summary fantastic keen scaling lends itself well to a dexterity focused build but the flambridge also works well in status effect oriented builds because it can also add frostbite or poison depending on the infusion and much like the forked greatsword the lower attack rating is often outweighed by the hemorrhage this weapon can apply particularly in boss encounters either dual wield greatswords for jump attacks or lean into an ash of war that hits multiple times like double slash spinning slash repeating thrust or blood tax for best results and lastly we come to the gargoyle's grade sword the gargoyle's greatsword shares the default moveset of many other great swords and deals physical damage it's one of the heavier greatswords in ellen ring weighing 11.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it has some of the best scaling among great swords it has very low stat requirements and can even be two-handed with twelve strength it can be outfitted with many different ashes of war the downsides of this weapon are that it takes a long time to acquire because you have to defeat the valiant gargoyles insead for the aqueduct and it is also outperformed by the iron greatsword in nearly every case conclusion the gargoyle's greatsword is a very strong greatsword but is outperformed by the iron greatsword in nearly every instance because of its higher base damage it's a great alternative to it if you cannot be bothered to farm the iron grade sword but there really isn't much other reason to use it other than appearance if you intend to use the garage grade sword lean into its superior scaling and make sure to crank your damage scaling attributes high to take full advantage of it which will often close the gap or surpass other similar greatswords in terms of attack rating at higher attribute ranges well that wraps up our greatswords

Title: Katanas are the Best Weapon in Elden Ring - Elden Ring All Katanas Breakdown
Video ID: 9zRWnBX52Es
Transcript Text:
in the southern ring video i'm gonna be showing you why katanas are the best weapon in eldon ring this is the second video of our series where we go through each weapon in a weapon category and kind of go through the pros and cons of these weapons to help you decide why you may or may not want to use them in your film before we get into each of the eight katanas however the first thing i want to talk about is katana styles of play in my opinion there are really two different styles of play available to all katanas and a third style available to a couple of them and the first style is playing with a single katana at a time usually two handing it and leading into its two-handed moveset when using a weapon skill like in the case of rivers of blood using that or using double slash something like that really leaning into that weapon skill or even in the case of moonvale using transient moonlight and using that without really needing to augment it with anything else the second style of play is where you're doing like a dual wield setup with katanas this is where you have one in each hand and you're usually leaning into some sort of status effect build up because this is a very very good way to do it um you might be using something like the uchi katana and maybe the surf and bone blade or dual uchi katanas etc something where you're trying to apply bleed really quickly and maybe something like frostbite or poison on top of that by using that dual will you know weapon move set and the last style of play that you could use that's really only available to a few of the katanas is a sort of spellblade type build where you use a staff in one hand and you use something like moonvale or meteor or maybe like magic uchitana or nagakiba in one hand or you use something like rivers of blood in one hand and use the dragon communion seal on the other and do like a incantation type build instead of a sorcery build like the others would be of these in my opinion i think playing with a two-handed setup for a katana using a weapon skill is probably the easiest style of play simply because the weapon skills in most of these katanas are fantastic they're really really strong on their own and the move set of katanas uh in general are really good some of them are very long reaching i think that's the easiest way to play closely followed by dual wield which really helps with status effect build up and then probably the most advanced style of play would be you know some sort of spellblade build however it's not something i think too many people are going to do unless they're leaning specifically into something like moonvale and i don't know that they're going to use like a magic uchitana or nagakiba all that often since if they're going to use a magic katana setup moonvale is arguably the best one to use for that talking a second about the pros of katanas in general most of them have decent attack speed and they also have some sort of status effect build up whether it's bleed or poison innate to them which is fantastic this allows you to stack status effects or always you know be able to trigger that hemorrhage status effect after enough attacks they also don't have terrible requirements for what you need in order to use them and a lot of them are found fairly early in the game making them viable for a vast majority of playthrough the cons of these weapons are that a couple of them that are very strong like rivers of blood and handle millennia are not available until very very late game and also the dual wield combo in my opinion is probably not one of the strongest dual combos there are there are other weapon types in my opinion like crew of swords or straight swords that have better two weapon combos having said all that let's take a look at the unique katanas first and first up is the serpent bone blade the serpamon blade has a unique r2 attack that hits twice in rapid succession and deals 100 physical damage and is one of the lightest katanas in ellen ring wing 6 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield one thing that's kind of interesting about this katana is that it actually uses regular smithing stones to upgrade despite the fact that it can't have its ash of war changed and that it's a unique katana the pros of this katana are that it causes poison buildup with every hit it has a unique r2 that's good for talismans that increase damage on hit like wing sword insignia and millicent's prosthesis as well as the axe talisman if you charge it up double slash is arguably one of the best ashes of aura for status effect build up and for boosting damage via repeated attacks it also has the second highest physical damage of all katanas behind hand of millennia barely inching out kinuchigatana and ki nagakiba the cons of this weapon are that it's miscible if you don't do the assassination quests in volcano manor which is also somewhat far into the game you cannot change the ash of war on this weapon and poison is much less effective than bleed in general in my experience and it also has a shorter reach than the nagakiba or hand of millennia conclusion the serpentbone blade should be a lot better than it is high base damage allows it to stay ahead of both the uchigatana and nagakiba in terms of raw damage but poison is much worse than bleed in general additionally you cannot change the affinity of this weapon which means you cannot add other status effects like bleeding or frostbite since you can do this with both the usuatana and nagakiba they are generally better options if you're going the status effect route the sweet spot for this weapon is around 50 dexterity and if you're going to use it make sure that you pair it with kindred abroad's exaltation and mushroom crown for best results as these boasts boost attack power when you've poisoned a nearby enemy or yourself consider two handing this weapon for easier staggers with charged r2s while using double slash as needed or use it in a dual wield setup with another katana for faster poison build up with the addition of bleed as well or swap back and forth like i do in my serpent samurai bill the serpent bone blade will perform worse with each ng plus cycle because it really only scales off of dexterity and you'll likely hit 80 dexterity or so at the end of your first playthrough or at the beginning of ng plus this means as enemies get tougher your damage won't really increase making you less effective as you progress further and further into ng pluses next up on our list is the iconic moon veil moonveel shares the default moveset of many other katanas and deals both physical and magic damage it has an average weight in elden ring weighing 6.5 and requires some points in strength dexterity and intelligence in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it causes bleed buildup with every hit it has the second highest total attack rating of all katanas behind the meteoric orb blade it has more magic and better magic scaling than the meteoritic coral blade transient moonlight is one of the best weapon skills in the game due to its high stagger when using the r2 variant and it can be found relatively early in the game by defeating the magma worm and gale tunnel the cons of this weapon are that it has shorter reach than both the nagakiba and hand of millennia it also has worse magic damage and worse magic damage scaling than the magic uchigatana in summary moonvale is one of the strongest weapons in eldon ring not only because it can be obtained relatively early in the game but also because it has exceptionally high stagger damage this allows you to stagger and critically strike nearly every enemy and boss in elden ring if you play aggressively and when paired with the assassins cerulean dagger creates an unstoppable machine that never runs out of fp moonvale's ideal stat spread is about 55 dexterity and 50 intelligence after which point you'll see a significant drop off in effectiveness however because you can still get decent damage out of these stats up until 80 this weapon will only get stronger in ng plus and probably taper off in ng plus 2 or ng 3 from which point you'll need to rely on your stagger and criticals for the bulk of your damage which you are likely doing anyway i personally love prioritizing intelligence when using moonvale in my ng playthrough allowing for a spellblade style of play that can also cast belts effectively with a small sacrifice in melee damage pair it with the carrion regal scepter and great blade phalanx for best results you can also dual-wield moonvale exceptionally well and i recommend doing so with a cold infused uchigatona in your offhand this will provide similar scaling and would allow you to apply frostbite to enemies struck reducing their resistances and ripping off a chunk of their health in addition to adding more bleed build up consider not critically striking bosses that you stagger with this setup and instead go to town with your dual willed combo in order to set hemorrhage and frostbite more quickly while they are staggered you could use the nagakiba instead of the uchikatana for this setup but i find that it has such long reach that a lot of times when you attack with it you'll miss with the moon veil while you hit with nogakiba which isn't ideal next up we'll be taking a look at the rivers of blood the rivers of blood shares the default moveset of many other katanas and deals physical and fire damage it has an average weight in elder ring weighing 6.5 and requires some points and strength dexterity and arcane in order to wield the pros of this weapon of which there are many are that bleed buildup occurs on any hit with the weapon or weapons skill corp's piler sets the hemorrhage status effect faster than any other katana except the uchi katana or nagakiba when set to occult and buffed with seppuku it has higher attack rating than either the nagakiba or uchigatana when set up this way however it has the third highest attack rating of all katanas in ellen ring behind moonville and meteoric or blade rivers of blood does both fire and physical damage benefiting greatly from flame grant me strength and also applies the blood flame status which makes bleed buildup continue for a split second after your last hit quartz pilot attacks quickly allowing you to make great use of winged sword insignia millicent's prosthesis or rotten winged sword insignia and lastly corpsepiler has much longer reach than double slash despite having the same animation the downsides to this weapon are that it's located extremely far into the game at the church of repose and mountaintops of the giants and it's not as effective against enemies that are bleed resistant or immune conclusion rivers of blood is one of the strongest weapons in eldon ring not only because of its ability to set the hemorrhage status effect rapidly despite having lower bleed buildup than many setups but because it also has higher damage than most other katanas and higher damage than all other katanas that are going from maximum bleed build up of course piler not only rips huge chunks of health off in a hurry with hemorrhage it also does substantial damage on its own and hits rapidly allowing you to use talismans like winged sword insignia rotten wing sword insignia and melissa's prosthesis on top of lord of blood's exaltation and chart of alexander to further boost damage with each hit you can also use white mask for an additional 10 damage increase as well despite having descaling an arcane rivers of blood actually has decent arcane scaling and shines at about 55 arcane and 50 dexterity increasing arcane first will increase the speed of your bleed build up and damage and is so recommended first especially since each point provides nearly the same damage boost as dexterity anyway rivers of blood makes a good candidate for some combination with the dragon communion seal since it has relatively good arcane scaling allowing you to play as a melee caster hybrid effectively however its weapon skill is so strong it's likely you won't need to cast many spells unless they are long range to pick off enemies you cannot hit with melee attacks if you're going to use drivers of blood lean into corv's piler and make sure you have lots of fp or ways to regain fp like using sacrificial axe in your left hand or a talisman that helps with fp so that you can use it on nearly every enemy you face you should avoid regular attacks whenever possible and use corpse piler as often as you can rivers of blood is also outstanding in ng plus and beyond because hemorrhage is based on the max hp of the enemy which will only get higher with each new game cycle but also because it scales effectively from arcane and dexterity allowing you to boost its damage into ng plus and ng plus two next up we're going to take a look at the meteoric aura blade the meteoric ore blade has a unique overhead chop for its r to attack that is reminiscent of sakiro's ichimonji and deals both physical and magic damage it's the heaviest katana and l ringwaying 7.5 and requires some points in strength dexterity and intelligence in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it applies bleeding build up with each strike and has the highest attack rating of all katanas in elven ring it has decent strength scaling making it an ideal candidate for two-handed katana play it can be found relatively early in elden ring in caled waypoint ruins it gives you plus 20 damage to gravity enemies and the r2 and charge tier 2 attack for this weapon are rather strong the cons of this weapon are that it's the shortest katana in eldon ring gravitas is a terrible weapon skill and deals poor damage and you cannot change the ash of war in summary the meteoric ore blade is in a weird spot because despite having the highest attack rating of all katanas in old ring it has a terrible weapon skill and its claim to fame is really its unique r2 and solid strength scaling the problem is that if you use this in your off hand in a dual world setup with a second katana then you cannot make full use of that strength scaling or its r2 and if you two hand this katana then you are stuck with its terrible weapon skill and very short reach so you're kind of damned if you do damned if you don't the ideal stat spread for this weapon is about 55 strength and minimum investment into intelligence and dexterity and moving forward strength will still outperform either these two attributes all the way up to 80 so you want to keep focusing there for your first playthrough in ng plus and beyond you can increase dexterity and intelligence to further boost damage making this weapon very viable in multiple ng pluses i'd personally pair this weapon with a cold infused uchi katana in my right hand for similar stats scaling frostbite build-up and a much stronger ash of war like carrion grander glint blade phalanx or glinstone pebble these two weapons have about the same reach making it likely you'll hit with both when you attack with l1 if you're positioned correctly if you use the cold nog akiba you get slightly worse dexterity scaling and it's much longer reach which is not especially helpful if you need to move close to hit with meteoric or a blade anyway the other option is to two-hand this weapon and get the extra damage from strength scaling leading into the charged r2 and r2 attacks of this weapon using something like the axe talisman to further enhance this attack's damage you'll need high poise for a setup like this so that you can swing through attacks uninterrupted so make sure you have high endurance and heavy armor with good poise if you want to play this way next up we have the dragon scale blade the dragon skill blade shares the default moveset of many other katanas and deals a hundred percent physical damage it's the lightest katana in element ring weighing 5.5 and it's tied with the uchi katana for this and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to will the pros of this weapon are that it has the highest attack rating behind meteor arc or a blade when buffed at higher attributes it deals plus 20 damage against dragon type enemies and plus 10 damage against ancient dragon type enemies and ice lightning sword adds lightning damage to the weapon and allows it to build up frostbite for its duration the downsides to this weapon are that it has no inherent status effect build up like other katanas do it's the second shortest katana in eldon ring it's found very late into the game in the lake of rod ice lightning sword has a very short duration at 20 seconds and you cannot change the ash of war this weapon conclusion the dragon scale blade is in a bad spot because it doesn't apply bleed or poison natively like all other katanas do and it must be buffed every 20 seconds in order to apply the frostbite with its attacks ice lightning sword has a very long wind up making this hard to do repeatedly emit aggressive boss fights and even though the weapon does extra damage to dragons these enemies are usually resistant to slash damage anyway making it less useful than it would appear you would ideally use this weapon in a dual wield setup with the dragon scale blade in your right hand for faster rebuffing since you'll need to reapply ice lightning sword every 20 seconds or so for best results i'd pair it with a cold uchi katana for faster frostbite build up and similar scaling these two weapons also have similar attack ranges making it easier to line up l1 attacks because the dragon skill blade really only scales effectively with dexterity and its buffs supply a flat 130 lightning damage it will continue to get worse and worse with excessive ng plus playthroughs where enemies will gain more and more health but your damage will not increase for this reason i don't recommend it in any playthrough past the first playthrough its ideal stat spread is about 50 dexterity but the weapon performs the best of any katanas at minimum requirements due to the damage ice lightning sword provides so it's not a bad choice for a low level playthrough or on a character that wants to remain low level to cooperate with lower level players the next weapon we're going to take a look at is the handle millenia handle millennia shares the default moveset of many other katanas and deals 100 physical damage it's one of the heaviest katanas in eldon ring wang 7 and requires some points in strength and a lot of points in dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it's the second longest katana and eldon ring behind nagakiba it has the second best dexterity scaling behind king nagakiba barely being inched out by one point it has the highest physical damage of all katanas waterfowl dance does considerable damage and can be extended for even more and finally waterfell dance has fantastic poise allowing you to tank a hit or two and still continue the weapons skill the downsides of this weapon are that it's located extremely late in the game by defeating melania blade of mikala effectively making it an ng plus weapon and lastly waterfowl dance builds up bleed extremely slowly making it much less effective than it could be conclusion hand of melania is a solid katana with less versatility and less status effect build up than other katanas but makes up for it with its long reach high physical damage and its unique weapon skill waterfall dance which can hit like a truck if set up properly waterfowl dance when used with high poise and talismans that increase your damages you hit more and more like winged sword insignia rotten wings sword insignia and millicent's prosthesis becomes an absolute unstoppable force that can wipe out entire packs of enemies with ease and sometimes bosses in one complete combo of this skill the downside to this weapon is that's less effective than rivers of blood in general because of waterfowl dance's rather long windup not only increasing the time it takes to kill enemies but also making it unviable and tight quarters with enemies pressing down upon you however where it really shines versus rivers of blood is against bosses and enemies that are bleed resistant or immune to bleed since handled melania does not rely on status effects for most of its damage you get your best bang for your buck with this weapon around its minimum requirements of 16 strength and 48 dexterity but it scales as good as king nagakiba all the way up to 80 dexterity so don't be afraid to push those numbers higher you will see your damage plateau with this weapon and ng pluses because of its low bleed build up because once you've taken dexterity to 80 you won't get too much more damage out of it however your damage should still remain very high with waterfowl dance getting you through ng plus and ng plus 2 rather easily either use this weapon two-handed leaning into waterfowl dance whenever possible or dual-wield it with a keen nagakiba which is slightly longer in length allowing you to hit enemies effectively with l1 unlike many other pairings with these weapons this should provide better bleed build up just be sure to use waterfowl dance when you need it if you do this and next up we come to the first of our non-unique katanas in the uchi katana the uchikatana shares the default moveset of many other katanas and deals 100 physical damage it is the lightest katana in eldon ring weighing 5.5 and requires some points and strength and dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that applies bleed build up with each hit it's extremely versatile and very good for status effect based builds samurais can begin the game with this weapon and it can be found very early on in death touched catacombs it has better scaling in general than the nog akiba and it has a very strong weapon skill and on sheath and you can change the ash of war and affinity on it the negative of this weapon is it's one of the shortest katanas in eldon rank conclusion the uchi katana is an exceptional katana that can be outfitted in nearly any way you wish it excels at status effect build up because of its native bleed build up and because you can outfit it with poison or frostbite on top of that for even more deadly combinations the uchikatana is usually best paired with another katana in your main hand when dual wielding because it's roughly the same length as the majority of katanas and ellen ring making l1s more effective in general i highly recommend the cold infusion when paired with moonvale meteoric orb blade or dragon scale blade the poison infusion when used with serpent bone blade for faster poison build up and the occult infusion if paired with rivers of blood for faster bleed buildup and lastly we come to the nagakiba the nagakiba has a unique r2 thrust attack that has very long range and deals 100 physical damage it's one of the heaviest katanas in elder ring wang 7 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that applies bleed build up with each hit it's extremely versatile and very good for status effect based builds it is the longest katana in ellen ring it can be acquired extremely early on by defeating bloody finger hunter yura it has a very strong weapon skill in unsheathed and you can change the ash of war and affinity on it the downsides of this weapon are that it has generally worse scaling than the uchigatana it can take a while to get if you don't kill yura early on and it requires some strength in order to one hand it conclusion the nog akiba is one of the best all-around katanas in eldon ring you can use it nearly any build you wish and it shines in both dual-wield and two-handing scenarios allowing you to play a samurai the way you want the extreme reach of this weapon outweighs its often slightly lower damage than the uchi katana because it allows you to land hits you would otherwise miss and allow you to sometimes avoid dangerous situations you might otherwise be in i highly recommend using this weapon on its own as i did in the blazing bushido build or pairing it with the hand of melania for a dual wield setup that has great reach double slash repeating thrusts blood attacks sword dance spinning slash and seppuku are all fantastic ashes of war for this weapon because they allow you to set status effects more easily well that wraps up our video on why katanas are the best weapon in eldon ring what do you guys think about katanas from all my knowledge and studying of the game so far it seems like the samurai is the most popular playstyle in eldon ring are you guys using katanas what katanas are you using let us know in the comments below [Music] [Music] [Music]

Title: Whips are the Best Weapon in Elden Ring - Elden Ring All Whips Breakdown
Video ID: 4VgveIbQ380
Transcript Text:
in this eldering video i'm gonna be showing you why whips are the best weapon in eldon ring and this is the third video in our series where we go through all of a weapon type in the game sort of showcase their moveset and talk about what their pros and cons are and why you might use them in your build before i get into each of the six whips themselves however the first thing i want to talk about are whip styles of play and how you might play when using the whip in elder ring there are really three styles of play available to the whips i'd say two of them are you know pretty consistent and the third one you might use in some cases and these are dual wielding whips usually in some sort of status effect setup where you're trying to hit rapidly with whips in order to set bleeding or maybe bleeding in some other status effect the second style of play is really using a whip in your off hand with some other weapon type in your main hand this is really one of the weapons that you might do that with you don't typically do that with a lot of weapons in this game but this is particularly popular in pvp where you can catch enemies off guard because the moveset of the whip is rather erratic and hard to predict and has rather large hitboxes sometimes because of the wide swings that it does and sometimes enemies have a hard time adjusting between one weapon and another weapon when using this in your offhand and lastly the other style of play is something sort of like a spell whip build if you will where you're using like the dragon communion seal in one hand and a whip in the other or using some other sacred seal in your hand in the case of the two fire scaling whips and casting incantations with these sort of setups of these i think dual whips is probably going to be the most popular i think a lot of people have used incantation builds in general or some sort of hybrid build and i think you know whips have a rather unique moveset so i think most people will probably lean into dual whipping but then probably second to that is some sort of you know spell whip build where you're using a whip kind of as your backup weapon while you're mainly casting incantations and then lastly i think it's probably the most advanced style of play is holding a whip in your left hand and using it or your right hand and using it as an alternative to what you mainly attack with with your weapon the pros of the whip weapon in general are that it tends to have longer reach than most every other weapon in the game and additionally it has rather wide hitboxes meaning that if there are like a lot of enemies grouped up you can typically hit most of them with one swing of this weapon which is something that is not true of a lot of weapons in the game additionally a couple of them have fantastic ashes of war and a couple of them have bleeding buildup which is great if you're trying to do a sas effect build the cons of this weapon are that the vast majority of them are found very late in the game meaning that you're not going to be able to use them for the vast majority of your playthrough they also tend to attack slower than a lot of weapons in the game and their combos are quite slow probably putting off a lot of players from using them in general the other thing that i want to mention here is that they have a rather limited selection of ashes of war and there aren't a lot for them to choose from and they also begin with kick in most cases which is not great i do want to mention a couple of ashes of war that are very good for whips though just to give you an idea what you could use since there are not that many great ones the first one is thunderbolt this scales very well with dexterity and whips in general scale well with dexterity so this is a very good option flame the red mains is also very good for whips the stagger damage on this is incredible which is you know one of the weaknesses of whips in general the downside here is that you cannot critically strike with whips so that you're not gonna be able to do like a critical attack when you stagger enemies however you can keep swinging into them so you can still get a lot of damage out of it another good option is either determination or royal knights resolve in order to boost your one hit attack damage again these weapons have very long range so it's not hard to get a one-off attack and then back away if you want to be playing a little bit more cautiously or you can put on bloodhound's step here and just dodge for days moving on to the unique whips in eldon ring the first one is the magma whip candlestick the magma whip candlestick shears the default moveset of many other whips and deals physical and fire damage it's one of the lightest whips in eldon ring wing 2.5 and requires some points in strength dexterity and faith in order to will the pros of this weapon are that it cannot be parried it has higher attack rating than all non-unique whips except keen or roomy it does both fire and physical damage which makes it benefit from flame grant me strength doubly and sea of magma also does both physical and fire damage making it benefit from playing grammy's strength doubly and lastly sea of magma is arguably the strongest weapon skill of all whips the cons of this weapon are that it has the shortest range of all whips and has no bleed buildup on hit it's found relatively far into the game by doing patches quest line in volcano manor and is missable and lastly it cannot perform critical hits like backstabs or posts summary magma candlestick whip deals very good damage for a whip and its weapon skill cf magma outperforms flame dance in terms of overall damage because the lava its spews also deals damage to enemies standing in it while you continuously hit them you can also hold down l2 to keep swinging your whip only stopping when you run out of fp or are interrupted even being able to walk while doing this this allows you to take advantage of talismans like winged sword insignia and millicent's prosthesis even though godfrey icon has no impact the biggest issue with this weapon is that it has poor range compared to other whips and you might miss more often than you think because nearly every other weap has a shared longer range and you might be used to the distance when fighting the styles of play available to the magma candlestick whip are somewhat limited because it scales with faith and dexterity this means it's not ideal for casting incantations nor is it ideal to use shield since you'll have no strength though you could use a medium shield for block counters if you really want it i'd recommend do wielding this weapon with either the urumi or haslow's pedal whip and setting either of them to flame art to also benefit from flame grant me strength this will allow you to use the fantastic weapon skill sea of magma which is a weak point of non-unique whips while also getting the benefit of dual wielding just make sure that you wear heavy armor with high poise in order to prevent yourself being staggered while holding down l2 the ideal stat spread for this weapon is 50 dexterity and 50 faith and points invested drop off from there however the weapon will continue to increase in damage into ng plus and beyond and you can invest points into strength when faith and dexterity stop performing the other unique whip and elden ring is giant's red braid the giant's red rage shares the default moveset of many other whips and deals physical and fire damage it is one of the lighter whips in eldering weighing 2.5 and requires some points in strength dexterity and faith in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it has the second highest attack rating of all whips it does both physical and fire damage which makes it benefit from flame grammy's strength doubly and flame dance also does both physical and fire damage making it benefit from flame grant me strength exceptionally as well flame dance is a solid weapon skill that deals decent damage rapidly in a large aoe making it good against single enemies or groups and lastly it cannot be parry the cons of this weapon are that it has rather high requirements for whip it has no status effect buildup on hit you cannot perform critical hits with it either backstabs or posts or other and it's found extremely late in the game after defeating the fire giant conclusion the giant's red raid is a very good whip to build around particularly if you plan to use incantation since it scales with both strength and faith allowing you to use the claw mark seal effectively it also has a fantastic weapon skill and flame dance that strikes repeatedly in a large aoe hitting many enemies at once it also benefits from talismans that increase attack power with repeated attacks like wing sword insignia which is a huge bonus because both the weapon itself and its weapon skill both deal physical and fire damage it benefits greatly from flame grant me strength making it almost a must for any build using this weapon and if you're going to use flame grammy's strength you might as well also use golden bow to further boost your damage and protection what's really great about this whip is that because it scales with strength so well and has such a strong weapon skill you can use it with a great shield you do block counters since you'll meet the strength requirements rather easily whips have extremely long block counter range but keep in mind that you cannot critically strike with whips so you use flame dance instead when enemies are staggered playing this way allows you to shore up one of the weaknesses of block counter builds which is aoe attacks that can deal with multiple enemies since you have that inflamed dance giant's red braid has an ideal stat spread of 50 strength 50 faith and 50 dexterity you won't reach this in your first playthrough which makes this weapon excellent for successive playthroughs since you'll continue to increase its damage the whole way and since flame dance does both physical and fire damage its increases in damage with all three of these stats which is phenomenal i'd play this weapon in some sort of incantation build with a claw mork seal or play with a great shield buffing with flame grant me strength and golden bow in a similar manner as the lightning lancerville but with a whip instead keep in mind that you will want very high poise when using flame dance or you'll be easily interrupted shoot for at least 51 though 56 is better moving along to the non-unique whips the first one is the whip no surprise whip shares the default moveset of many other whips and deals physical damage it's the lightest whip and elden ringwaying 2 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it's the lightest whip in eldon ring you can change the ash of war and affinity on it it has very good bleed affinity scaling that puts it on par with other infusible whips but only at higher stats it can be found extremely early on in the game at castle mourn and cannot be parried the negatives of this weapon are that it has the lowest damage of all whips in nearly every case it has no bleed build up on hit it has a very limited selection of ashes of war most of which are not useful and it cannot perform critical hits in summary the whip is the weakest of all whips in eldon ring and the only reason to really use it is because you can find it so easily in the game compared to most other whips making it the only option for some time it has the lowest attack rating in every possible infusion and provides no bleed build up on hit unlike the thorned whip and oslo's pedal whip you gain the most damage from this weapon by using lightning and fire infusions with magic pulling up a close second and sacred and flame art a near third in terms of total attack rating however these infusions apply split damage of physical and fire lightning holy or magic so you'll have to make sure enemies you're facing do not resist these types or you'll do less damage than a pure physical damage infusion keen provides the best physical damage so you should consider going the dexterity route when using this weapon if you want the highest one-handed physical damage per hit possible the bleed affinity actually provides decent strength dexterity and arcane scaling allowing the whip to catch up to other bleed-infused whips at 50 strength 50 dexterity and 50 arcane in terms of total attack rating however it is unlikely we'll use the whip far enough into the game to reach those stats which is likely ng plus and beyond i highly recommend using this weapon in a dual wield setup with another whip like the urumi until you are able to swap it out with either the thorned whip or haslow's pedal lip which adds bleed buildup natively keen is your best scaling option until you acquire a horofrost stomp or the glenstone wetblade at which point cold has the same attack rating more or less but also applies frostbite with each attack if you don't mind the split damage go with cold from this point onward otherwise stick with keen next up we have the thorned whip the thorned whip shares the default moveset of many other whips and deals physical damage it is one of the lighter whips in eldering wing 2.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the pros of the thorn whipped are that hits with this weapon cause bleed buildup you can change the ash of war and affinity on it rather easily you can acquire two in a single playthrough without having to have one dropped by another player and finally it cannot be parried the cons of this weapon are that it's very difficult to farm from the prelate enemy and the mountaintops of the giants it's found extremely late in the game in the mountaintops of the giants it has the second most damage of all whips it is a very limited selection of ashes of war most of which are not useful and finally it cannot perform critical hits conclusion the biggest assets of this weapon are that it applies bleed buildup natively with each hit and that you can get two of them without having another player drop them but it by and large follows a similar pattern of the basic whip and that it tends to be outperformed by every other whip in terms of attack rating except the whip itself you also cannot even acquire it until near the end of the game so it's not something that will play a major part in any normal playthrough much like the whip its highest damage scaling is lightning and fire and then magic and then sacred and flame arm but the weapon scales best with the keen infusion unlike the whip though a cult is a viable option for this weapon because points in arcane will increase the bleed buildup of each strike as well as increase its attack rating a colt affinity has a lower attack rating than keen but only by about 20 damage which in my opinion is an easy trade-off for nearly double the bleed build up at 50 arcane make sure to use lord of blood's exaltation and white mask if you're set up this way cold is another great option here to not only stack double status effect build up with each hit frostbite and hemorrhage but also because the attack rating is nearly identical to keen giving you an edge as long as enemies are not magic resistant if you're going to use this weapon i highly recommend either dual wielding two of them or one of them and a hoslow's pedal whip and a status effect build that goes the coal route stacking frostbite and hemorrhage or using this weapon with the dragon communion seal and going the occult route in some sort of spell whip bill next up we have the urumi the roomie has a unique charge chart to attack that is a slash followed by a very long thrusted attack and deals physical damage it's one of the heavier whips in eldon ring wang 3 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it has the highest attack rating of all whips when it's using the keen affinity it has higher attack rating than all other infusible whips at any affinity and keeps pace with both magma whip candlestick and giant spread braid when using the fire and flame art infusions you can change the ash of war and affinity on it it is found relatively early on in elden ring inside carry a manor its unique r2 has extremely long reach and it cannot be parried the cons of this weapon are that it has no bleed buildup on hit the charged r2 has strange hitboxes that can miss easily there are a very limited selection of ashes of war on whips and most of which are not useful and it cannot perform critical hits conclusion the urami is the pound-for-pound king of whips in terms of overall attack rating not only does it have the highest attack rating of any whip when using the keen affinity it matches or surpasses every other whip when set to other or similar affinities you can also get it relatively early on in the game making it the go to whip for a large stretch of gameplay or possibly even the entire game the unique charge r2 has very good range making it a nice addition to the whip moveset if you want to eke out even a little bit more range and you can use the axe talisman to boost its damage however the hitbox of this is pinpoint small and lands to the right of your lock-on causing it to miss in many cases where it shouldn't use this against larger targets that are much wider for best results the biggest downside of this weapon is that it only does slightly more damage than haslow's pedal whip when using any other infusion aside from keen and that whip also has bleed buildup on hit however many players may not know how to acquire that whip early on making this a good option if they don't once you acquire the arumi you should only have two whips available to you unless you kill dialos so this is the earliest you can dual wield them since the arumi and whip both scale well with the keen affinity this is not a bad option until others become available if you wish to go the dual world route otherwise you could go with cold infusion for frostbite build up or you can change to lightning or fire in sacred or flame art as you find these ashes of war or wet blades these are all good options for dual wield the arumi also has exceptional magic damage making it a strong pick for a spell whip sort of build that has high intelligence and uses sorceries with a staff in the other hand but barely outperforms oslo's pedowhip and total attack rating and that has bleed build up so consider swapping it out once you get it and lastly we come to haslow's paddle whip ozil's pedal lip shares the default moveset of many other whips and deals physical damage it's the heaviest whip and elden ring wing 3.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it causes bleed buildup with every hit it has nearly as good attack rating as the urumi in most cases you can change the ash of war and affinity on it rather easily you can acquire two of these in a single playthrough without having another player drop one it can be found relatively early on in the game if you kill dlos and it cannot be parried the negatives of this weapon are that it has shorter range than most other whips although by only a very small amount it has a very limited selection of ash of wars which are not particularly useful it can take a very long time to get this weapon if you're unwilling to kill dlos and finally it cannot perform critical hits conclusion oslo's pedal lip is arguably the best non-unique whip and ellen ring its attack rating while lower than the arumi in nearly every case is only so by a minimal amount that is easily offset by its native bleed buildup on hit the only exception might be if you're playing a dexterity build where this difference is nearly 100 attack rating so if you're playing a dexterity focused build go with urumi there are many different ways you can use oslo's pedal lift you can use it in a spell whip build that still applies bleed build up but uses the magic affinity you can go the occult route which only has slightly less attack rating than heavier keen but doubles the bleed build up this would also allow you to use the dragon communion seal effectively or you could go with a cold infusion allowing you to trigger frostbite and hemorrhage all these are great options and i recommend using either two paddle lips if you want to dual wield or using a thorn whip if you don't have two and just like the thorn whip make sure to use lord of blood's exaltation and white mask if you go with the bleed focused build if you're going to be playing a whip build in general i highly recommend that you kill dlos to obtain this item and learning of the lakes in order to have a stronger option than either the whip or the urumi this is particularly true if you wish to make a status effect oriented build since it has native bleed build up and neither the whip or a roomy do well that wraps up our video on why whips are the best weapons in the elden ring if you guys have other tips about the whip weapons please leave them in the comments below again a lot of information on these weapons it's hard to fit it all into a video so what whips are you guys using in your build what have you mixed them with in order to make the ideal setup for you let us know in the comments below [Music] bye [Music] [Music]

Title: Twinblades are the Best Weapon in Elden Ring - Elden Ring All Twinblades Breakdown
Video ID: wwj5I6sxGHk
Transcript Text:
in this Elden ring video I'm going to be showing you why twin blades are the best weapon in Elden ring this is the fourth video in our Series where we go through each weapon type and take a look at each weapon inside that weapon type sort of go through their move set and explain why you may or may not want to use it in your build hopefully you've caught on by now that the title of these videos is satire due to all the clickbait videos out there and really we're just showcasing information about these weapons and showing that every weapon in eldering can be used if you know how to use it properly before we get into the Twin blades themselves however want to talk about twin blades in general and the play styles of twin blades usually there's pretty much two setups you're going to use with a twin blade you're either going to twohand a twin blade in order to get the move set of two-handing twin blades or you're going to dual wield twin blades in order to hit rapidly with jump attacks you don't typically see people one- handing twin blades with a Spell blade build or one- handing them with his shield because really the strength of the twin blade is the fact that it can hit rapidly when two-handing or hit rapidly when dual wielding of these two play styles I think that you'll see the dual wielding of twin blades far more often than a single Twin Blade and that's because of the four hits on jump attack not on like curv swords and what's really interesting about twin blades is they actually have better status effect buildup than curv swords so you get that rapid strikes like you would with curve swords but you get even more buildup when doing that which makes them more effective at applying statuses if you're using a jump attack sort of combo and then the other one is simply two-handing a twin blade in order to use the move set while two-handing which is also very fast but not as fast is the jump attacks from dual wielding and leaning into an ash of war that you can put on this twin Blades by default most of them have spinning slash which is a terrible Ash of War because spinning slash only accounts for basically one half of the weapon when you're using it if you're dual wielding when you use spinning slash or you're using a weapon like twin blades that hits with both sides it doesn't take that into account and only uses one weapon or one side of the weapon so you basically get the same damage you would get if you were just attacking with a regular attack so you want to swap out spinning slash on your twin blade as soon as possible if you can talking a little bit about the pros and cons of this weapon it kind of sits somewhere between a great sword and a straight sword in terms of damage you're going to get on average more damage than a straight sword but less than a great sword with similar setups and it also allows for status effect build up faster than just about any weapon type in the game as I mentioned the jump attack of the dual wield hits four times rapidly and it has better status effect buildup so if you're playing a status effect buildup setup then dual WI is not a bad way to go the cons of this weapon type are that five of the six Twin blades aren't found earlier than alt's Plateau which means you're going to be stuck with the regular twin blade for a large section of the game and you won't be able to acquire a second one until much much further and on top of that none of these twin blades can you get two of without getting another player to drop one to you or going into NG plus because none of them drop from enemies so none of them are farmable also another thing I want to mention is that when you're using the two-handed move set of this weapon even though it hits twice rapidly with each swing that first hit only does about a third of the damage that the second hit does so you're not getting two full hits of damage which would make this obviously a lot stronger than it could be and is why it's better for a status effect build because even though that hit is only a third of the damage you're still getting that extra status effect buildup moving along to the unique twin blades the first one is gargoyle's black blades gargoyle's Black Blade shares the default move set of many other twin blades and Deals physical and holy damage it's the heaviest twin blade in Elden ring wing 8.5 and re reir some points in strength dexterity and faith and order to use the pros of this weapon are that it has exceptionally high damage at minimum requirements it has the highest attack rating of all twin blades it makes great use of talismans like Wing sword Insignia rotten Wing sword Insignia and melison prosthesis as well as the thorny crack tier which all boost damage on successive hits the cons are that it has poor Faith scaling it's found very far into the game by defeating the Black Blade Kindred in mountain tops of the Giants you cannot change the ash of War on this weapon and spinning slash does not hit with both ends of the weapon making it deal about the same damage more or less as a normal attack holy damage is resisted by some of the toughest bosses in Elden ring and it has the worst strength scaling compared against heavy infused twin Blades by nearly 100 damage conclusion although gargoyle's black blades has the highest damage of all twin blades it does both physical and holy damage holy damage is arguably one of the worst damage types late game in Elden ring because some of the hardest bosses resist it additionally spinning slash does not take advantage of both ends of this weapon making it a terrible weapon skill on a twin blade the damage dealt by spinning slash will be the same or less than regular attacks and those don't cost FP because you cannot change this weapon skill on the gargoyle's black blades you'll essentially be playing without a weapon skill if you use this weapon in your main hand unless you one-and it the gargoyle's black blades have terrible Faith scaling making 80 strength the optimal stat spread for this weapon with minimum requirements in dexterity and faith you'd think two-handing this weapon would increase your damage significantly because of this but it really doesn't boosting it by a mere 27 damage this puts this weapon in a terrible place because two-handing doesn't boost damage much and also sticks you with a crappy weapon skill if you do if you do a wield you'll need to boost strength to get the most damage out of it so whichever Twin Blade you pair with will also need strength scaling but neither weapon will gain the extra damage from strength because you aren't two-handing if you insist on using this weapon I'd actually one-hand it and treat it as a regular sword and pair it with a great Shield since you already have high strength anyways this will allow you to block counter and use spinning slash when needed it's certainly not ideal to use a twin blade this way but 700 attack rating is great sword levels of damage on a weapon that swings faster next up we have Eleanor's pull blade Eleanor's pull blade has a unique R2 that increases in rotation if it's charged and Deals physical and fire damage it is the lightest twin blade in Elden ring wing 6 and requires some points in strength dexterity and Arcane in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it causes bleed buildup on each hit it has a fantastic weapon skill in blood blade dance it benefits well from flame grant me strength since it deals both physical and fire damage it makes great use of Talisman like winging sword Insignia rotten Wing sword Insignia and melison prosthesis as well as the thorny crack tier which all boost damage on successive hits and finally it's the lightest twin blade in the game the downsides of this weapon are that it's found a ways into the game and Altus plateau and that it has split damage that isn't ideal for enemies that resist fire damage conclusion Elanor pull blade is arguably the most powerful Twin Blade when used alone between its native bleed buildup on every hit and its weapon skill blood blade dance that not only hits rapidly but often staggers enemies it's one of the deadliest weapons in Elden ring its damage is in the middle bottom of the pack when it comes to Twin blades but it has far more damage than any Twin Blade Set to the bleed Affinity because this weapon scales with dexterity and Arcane you can pair it with the dragon communion seal quite well allowing for a hybrid sort of build that also cast some spells you won't have a ton of points to invest in F but you should have enough for Dragon spells and some Buffs this is great because you can use talismans that boost your attack power on successive hits like Wing sword Insignia and then cast spells for increased damage similar to the Dragon Warrior build I made just with this weapon instead of curv Swords The Sweet Spot for this weapon is about 50 dexterity and 50 Arcane with Arcane further increasing your bleed buildup you'll be able to increase the damage of this weapon on into NG plus making it viable for success of playthroughs particularly because bleed damage is based off the max health of enemies because blood blade dance is so deadly I'd either use this weapon two-handed and lean into its weapon skill or pair it with the dragon communion seal for some spell casting remember that weapon skills do not take into account your offhand when using them so there's really no reason to do wi if you're spamming blood blade dance however if you pair it with an Ault infused godkin peeler in your main hand that uses sabuku you'll have insane damage and bleed build up with jump attacks moving along to the non-unique twin blades the first up is the twin blade itself the twin blade shares the default move set of many other twin blades and deals physical damage it's the second lightest twin blade in Elden ring wing seven and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it can be found at the beginning of the game in the dragon burnt runes and limb grave you can use many different ashes of war and can change the Affinity it's not that far behind in damage compared to the twin knight swords and godkin peeler which are found much later it makes great use of talismans like Wing sword Insignia rotten Wing sword Insignia millin prosthesis as well as the thorny crack tier which all boost damage on successive hits the major downside of this weapon is that it has the lowest damage at nearly every infusion compared to all other twin blades conclusion really the only reason to use the twin blade is because you can get it so early in the game but otherwise it falls behind all other twin blades in nearly every infusion however it's not so far behind twin Knights swords and God skin peeler that you need to replace it once you have these especially if you've already upgraded it and are shter materials I'd wait to swap it with gargoyle's twin blade once you get it since that has significantly more damage you'll gain the most most damage from the fire and lightning infusions then with magic coming second and sacred INF flame Arts landing at third if you're two-handing it heavy comes in a solid fourth place with all their infusions much further behind however as I mentioned earlier twin blades are particularly good at setting status effects so the cold infusion is not a bad option as it outperforms Keen aold quality and blood and poison in terms of total attack rating because you won't have access to another Twin Blade weapon for some time you'll likely twoand this weapon until you get another one or just use it as a regular sword with a Shield until you acquire twin knight swords or God skin peeler I highly recommend going with the cold or bleed infusions if you're two-handing for status effect buildup or going with lightning or fire if you're one-h handing it with a shield the twin blade leans towards the dexterity side of things scaling wise which makes it better suited to a dowi build than two-handing because you don't gain extra damage when two-handing from the dexterity stat like you do with strength for this reason you should pair it with godkin peeler which also has better dexterity scaling and strength once you have it and probably replace it with gargoyle's twin blade or twin Knight sword eventually up next is the twin knight swords the twin knight swords shares the default move set of many other twin blades and Deals physical damage it's the second heaviest twin blade in Elden ring wing 8 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are has the longest length of all twin Blades by a very small amount it can use many ashes of war and can change Affinity it makes great use of talismans like Wing sword Insignia rotten Wings sworn Insignia and millison prothesis as well as the thorny crack tier which all boost damage on successive hit H the cons of this weapon are that it's found a ways into the game and Altus Plateau it does less damage than the gargoyle's twin blade in the majority of cases and godkin peeler in some cases conclusion twin knight swords is a very well-rounded Twin Blade that scales better with strength and dexterity but still outperforms the twin blade in every case including the Keen infusion though not always by much it also has the longest reach of all twin Blades by a very small amount though it is much longer than the gargoyle's twin blade which is its biggest competition because of similar scaling so Factor this into your decision when choosing between the two of those twin blades much like the twin blade you'll gain the most damage from the fire and lightning infusion with magic coming in second and sacred and Flame ARS landing at third however unlike the twin blade two-handing this weapon puts heavy cold and blood and poison in a much better position due to strength scaling heavy actually comes out second when two-handing and cold lands just under sacred and Flame Arc by the time you acquire this weapon you should have access to the Twin Blade and you should have the godkin peeler and elor's P blade not long after if you don't have them already which will allow you to do wield if you want though as I mentioned strength scaling is particularly good with this weapon and you won't gain that extra damage if you do wield so the choice is really up to you of the available twin blades godkin peeler is probably the best choice to pair it with if you're going for a bleed build setup otherwise strongly consider the heavy or cold infusion if you want a two-handed for solid damage with good strength scaling next up we have the godkin peeler the godkin peeler has a unique R2 that changes when two handing and Deals physical damage it is the second heaviest twin blade in Elden ring wing 8 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the upsides to this weapon are that it has the best keen and aold scaling of all twin blades you can use many ashes of AA and can change the Affinity it makes great use of Talisman like Wing sword Insignia rotten Wing sword Insignia nisin prosthesis as well as the thorny crack tier which all boost damage on success of hits the negatives are that it's found a ways into the game in alt's plateau in summary the Godin peeler has the best keen and ultt scaling of all twin blades making an ideal weapon to be dual wielded in some sort of bleed build when set to the ult affinity and used with seppuku it has incredibly good damage as well as bleed buildup and that's not even if you pair it with another Twin Blade that can do bleed since bleed is less effective on regular enemies since they tend to die before it triggers this allows you to have solid damage even when not buffed and apply soku as needed for more challenging enemies or bosses good choice is to pair this weapon with or Elanor pole blade since it will have native bleed buil up on it or the twin knight sword set to a bleed affinity so it doesn't need to be bed you can even use the gargoyle's blood Twin Blade if you wish though it has shorter range when set to the cold Affinity you should crank Arcane to boost damage and to boost bleed buildup when someu is used wear the white mask in Lord of blood's exaltation for increased attack power and Slot Wing sword and signia and millison prosthesis plus the jump attacked Talisman for maximum damage output and lastly we come to the Gargoyles Twin Blade the gargo twin blade shares the default move set of many other twin blades and Deals physical damage it's the heaviest twin blade in Elden ring weigh 8.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it has the best heavy scaling of all twin blades it has the highest attack rating at nearly every infusion you can use many ashes of war and can change the Affinity it makes good use of talismans like Wing sword Insignia rotten Wings sword Insignia millison prosthesis as well as the thorny crack tier which all boost damage on successive hits the downsides are that it has the shortest length of all twin blades it's found far into the game by defeating the Valiant gargoyle Duo and it's the heaviest of all twin blades conclusion the Gargoyles Twin Blade has the best allaround damage of infusible twin blades in Elden ring it wins out in terms of damage in nearly every category only losing to God skin peeler and keen and a Cole the downside is that has the shortest reach of all twin Blades by a lot and it isn't found until much further into the game than the twin KN swword which as I mentioned before has similar scaling because the gargoyle's twin blade leans to the strength side of things and has the best strength scaling of all twin blades it makes an ideal candidate for a sing SLE two-handed setup preferably with an ash of war that is boosted in damage by strength such as flame of the red mans however you don't need to use the heavy infusion with this weapon and can use cold or blood if you wish since you will still have very good strength scaling with these infusions and they apply status effects if you're going to two-hand this weapon definitely go with heavy cold or blood for best results but if you want to one-handed like a sword which you could the lightning or fire infusions will give you almost the same damage as the gargoyle's black blades and you can change your Ash of War to something better well that wraps up our video on on why twin blades are the best weapon in Elden ring I hope you guys have enjoyed this video series we're going to continue to put out one video a week and combined with one build if possible if you guys have other tips that I missed about twin blades leave them in the comments below but I want to know what twin blades you guys are using in your build is everyone using the godkin peeler a cold setup or are you using something else let me know in the comments below [Music] [Music] w

Title: Reapers are the Best Weapon in Elden Ring - Elden Ring All Reapers Breakdown
Video ID: aNgCAUFCXx4
Transcript Text:
in this video I'm going to be showing you why reapers are the best weapon in Elden ring this is the fifth video in our Series where we go through the different weapon types of Elden ring and go through each weapon in that weapon type and sort of compare them go through their strengths and weaknesses and sort of give you some information that will help you decide if you wanted to be part of your build or not before I get into the Reapers themselves however the first thing I want to talk about is the way that you would probably play with a Reaper in Elden ring in my opinion there are probably two ways that most players will use Reapers in Elden ring and that is either two-handing a Reaper and using the move move set of that and leaning into the ash of war or weapon skill on that Reaper or dual wielding Reapers and using something like a jump attack build and a weapon skill I don't think too many people will use Reapers when using a block counter sort of build because block counters with Reaper weapons is very very slow and not particularly good and you just don't see too many people playing like a Spell blade t a build with a Reaper in one hand and a scepter or you know a seal in the other hand although you could if you want of these two styles of play I think playing a jump attack sort of build where you're dual wielding is probably the easiest and that's because the damage you do is just slightly less than great swords when you're doing a jump attack build but you also get that status effect buildup from the Reapers which is fantastic I also want to talk about the pros and cons of the reaper weapon type in general before I get into each weapon and probably the biggest Pro of this weapon is that attacks with this weapon actually take some damage through Shields meaning if a player or enemy is blocking when you hit them with a Reaper you're actually going to do chip damage through their Shield which is is fantastic and additionally all the Reapers have bleed status effect buildup intrinsically on them meaning that you don't have to do anything to make them bleed they're all going to apply bleeding to the Target over time with their attacks which is great they also have pretty good reach and similar attack rating to Great swords in a lot of cases another really big positive to this weapon type is that you can acquire every single Reaper by the time you reach kalid which isn't that far into the game it's about a third of the way into the game roughly and then you can have use any of the sides and if you know where to get them you can actually beine to these faster and get them but they're not found that late in the game compared to some other weapon types the negatives of this weapon are that they have a slower attack speed than other weapons that deal about the same amount of damage like the great swword for instance so the combos take a little bit longer to do also their dual wield L1 combo isn't particularly good although their jump attack is fine now that I've sort of given you an overview of the reaper weapon class itself let's get into the unique Reapers first and the first one is the Halo Scythe the Halo Scythe shares the default move set of most other Reapers and Deals physical damage it's the second heaviest Reaper in Elden ring wi 8.5 and requires some points in strength dexterity and faith in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it causes bleed build up with each hit and it can be found somewhat early on in kalid by farming the clean rot Knight Additionally you can acquire two in a single playthrough without needing a player to drop one it deals far more physical damage than holy which is great because holy damage isn't particularly a good damage type late game light attacks ignore 40% damage negation from blocks and heavy and charged attacks ignore or more the weapon skill it has micholas ring of light does 100% holy damage making it easily boosted by sacred scorpion charm and holy shrouding crack tier and finally michola ring of light has a very long range and can be chain spamed the negatives of this weapon are that it has poor Faith scaling and Mah's ring of light increases its damage only with a faith attribute and not the strength through dexterity attributes holy damage is one of the worst damage types late game and is resisted by many of the game's toughest bosses you cannot change the ash of war or Affinity of this weapon and it can take you a while to farm one or two of these conclusion of the two unique size Halo size is the better of the two for first playthrough it does far more physical damage than holy damage making it more effective in fights where bosses resist this type of damage which many of the toughest do micha's ring of light can often one or two shot most enemies from a very long distance for 11 FP per cast and is easily increased with sacred scorpion charm holy shroud and crack tier as well as ritual sword Talisman and Shard of Alexander the over attack rating is essentially tied with the wing scythe and some infusions of grave Scythe making it a solid choice if all you're worried about is damage though Wing Scythe will outscale it eventually in NG plus and into ng+ plus ideally you'd want strength and dexterity to be around 50 to get the most out of this weapon before the damage starts dropping off and then you can crank faith for some additional damage however Faith scaling is very minimal with this weapon making the Halo Scythe a poor choice for strength they build that uses incantations though you could if you really wanted to consider dual wielding two Halo sies for optimal scaling or pairing a Halo scthe with a grave sithe if you'd like a different Ash of war the michela's Ring of light and possibly some frostbite buildup next up we have the wing Scythe the wing scthe shares the default move set of most other Reapers and Deals physical damage it's the lightest Reaper in Elden ring wing 7.5 and requires some points in strength dexterity and faith in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it causes bleed build up with each hit it has the highest damage of all size by a little bit it has the highest potential damage of all size in NG plus and Beyond it can be found extremely early on in the game in tombs word ruins and weaving Peninsula and it performs amazingly in NG plus and Beyond because of decent scaling in faith dexterity and strength additionally it's the lightest of all Reapers its light attacks ignore 40% damage negation from blocks and heavy and charged attacks ignore more and it prevents the use of recovery flasks making it good in PvP or against hostile NPCs who heal the negatives of this weapon are that it has high stat requirements in order to wield it's the shortest sithe by a good amount you cannot change the ash of war or Affinity on it and holy damage is one of the worst types later in the game and is resisted by many of the game's toughest bosses and it deals a lot of holy damage conclusion the wingyee is a solid all-around Reaper it's pretty much tied for total attack rating and you can get it very early on in the game making it the go-to choice if you want to use a Reaper right away it's also extremely light which matters more early on in the game when you don't have as much endurance the downsides are that it's the shortest Reaper by a good ways in its weapon skill angel's wings which is a essentially Loretta slash has a very long animation which makes it easy to get hit when using it against bosses that aren't easily staggered it also does more holy damage than physical damage making it a poor choice against some endgame bosses The Sweet Spot for this weapon is 50 dexterity and 50 Faith with both dexterity and Faith outperforming strength all the way up to 80 so take them there first before increasing strength this allows Wing Scythe to keep increasing its damage well into NG plus and Beyond where it should outshine the Halo side in terms of total attack rating and since these stats all increase the damage of angel's wings it will continue to perform reasonably well the whole way consider using this weapon alone learning to use angel's wings or in a dual wield setup with the Scythe that will allow you to use a better Ash of War then also has similar scaling you can either use flame AR or sacred or use the Keen scythe and buff it with incantations to further increase its damage moving on to the non-unique Reapers first up is the Scythe the Scythe has a unique R2 that when charged can hit twice and Deals physical damage it is the lightest for an Elden ring wing 7.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it causes bleed build up with each hit it's the longest Reaper by a small amount barely beating out the grave Scythe you can use a wide variety of Ashes of war and Affinity on it can be changed it can be found relatively early on in the game in Cliff bottom catacombs and learning of the Lakes it's the lightest of all Reapers tied with wing scythe and its light attacks ignore 40% damage negation from blocks and heavy and charged attacks ignore more the cons of this weapon are that that has the lowest damage at nearly every infusion in summary the Scythe has lower damage than the grave Scythe when using any Affinity with it but Keen however the upsides are that you don't have to farm it it is just slightly longer than the grave scythe and it does have a unique charge J to that hits twice which is good for status effect buildup even though the first hit of this attack does much less damage additionally it leans more to the dexterity side of things making it a better option to pair with the wing side if you plan to do a wield since it scales better with dexterity than strength there are many good ashes of War you can use with this weon to help you hit repeatedly building up status effects more rapidly than the normal R1 attack of the reaper which is slow these include spinning slash which it comes with double slash sword dance Phantom slash and spinning weapon really there are many ways to use this weapon you could dual wield it with the wing sight set to Flame arter sacred to have similar scaling or keen and buff it with incantations and play a jump attack sort of build that deals high damage per jump attack not relying on status effects for damage or you could use it alone or with a shield leaning into an ash of war that can hit rap like any of the ones I just mentioned and focusing on status effect buildup via Ault or cold affinities or you could use it with something like determination or Royal Knights resolve and focused on charged R2 attacks for high burst damage and Status effect buildup and this brings us to the last Reaper in the game which is the grave Scythe the grave Scythe shares the default move set of most other Reapers and Deals physical damage it's the heaviest Reaper in Elden ring weighing 9.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it causes bleed build up with each hit it's the second longest Reaper barely losing to the side you can use a wide variety of Ashes of war and Affinity on it can be changed it can be found relatively early on in the game from skelet to Mages and learning of the Lakes you can acquire two in a single playthrough without needing a player to drop one and lastly light attacks ignore 40% damage negation from blocks and heavy and charged attacks ignore more the negatives of this weapon are that it's the heaviest of all Reapers and it can take well to farm one or two of them in summary the grave Scythe is generally speaking better than the Scythe it does more damage when using any Affinity but keen and it Rivals Halo scthe and wingsthe for total attack rating when set to fire or lightning magic or heavy with sacred and Flame art not far behind you can also get two of them if you wish to do a wield which is fantastic because this weapon scales more with strength than dexterity it makes a better candidate for two-handing than the sidethe and a good choice for status effect build that uses a weapon skill to strike rapidly this is because the cold infusion will still have decent strength scaling and this allows you to gain bonus damage when two-handing and weapon skills don't apply your off hand to their damage so dual wielding isn't really needed if you're leaning into a weapon skill ideally you'd use this solo with the cold infusion repair with the Halo side than a dual wield sort of build that allows you to use a different weapon skill than Miko's ring of light because it also scales well with strength no matter which you choose the cold infusion is still a great way to go here since it will come out with higher damage at 50 strength and 50 dexterity than quality and it still applies Frostbite the Halo Scythe has terrible Faith scaling making flame arten sacred a bad pairing with it if you decide to dual wield sides since you won't want to invest in faith when using haloid if you don't have to well that wraps up our fifth video in this series about Reapers what do you guys think about Reapers do you think they're a solid weapon in Elden ring would you like to see more Reapers if there's a DLC which reapers are you using let us know in the comments below [Music] [Music] w [Music]

Title: Colossal Weapons are the Best Weapon in Elden Ring - Elden Ring All Colossal Weapons Breakdown
Video ID: aFZ7iewnrB4
Transcript Text:
in this ellen ring video i'm gonna be showing you why colossal weapons are the best weapon in elven ring this is the sixth video of our series where we go through each weapon in a given weapon category and sort of go through the pros and cons and show you how to use those weapons effectively so that you can decide whether or not you want it to be part of your build before i get into the weapons themselves though i want to talk about colossal weapon styles of play first and what the pros and cons of that weapon group is in my opinion there are probably three main ways most players will use colossal weapons and elden ring and the first is using a single colossal weapon and leaning into its two hand moveset and its weapon skill and this is usually because of the enormous weight of this weapon type that it's easier to use one of these than it is to try and use two the second way is actually dual wielding to these and doing some sort of jump attack build that absolutely pancakes bosses and this is a bit more difficult to pull off because as i mentioned the weight class of these weapons is catastrophic they are the heaviest weight group in the entire game so getting enough endurance in order to wield two of these usually means that you aren't wearing any armor or you're wearing very very light protection which can be hard to pull off if you can't stagger enemies constantly and then lastly you probably have some sort of build that uses a single colossal weapon and a sacred seal and this is because most colossal weapons have high or very high strength requirements and you can use the claw mark seal in order to cast spells by using the strength stat so if you're playing a strength faith build then colossal weapons are not a bad choice because you need very high strength in order to use them anyway of these three types i think using a single colossal weapon or a single colossal weapon with a sacred seal are probably the most likely because you really have to plan ahead in order to dual wield colossal weapons and a lot of cases it's just easier to dual wield something like great swords or great hammers or great axes because the weight is so much less talking a bit about the pros of this weapon group colossal weapons they typically have the highest attack rating in the game or close to it in most cases meaning that you're going to have the highest possible damage numbers on your damage sheet now that doesn't always translate to actual damage in the game in terms of you know how a weapon performs for instance rivers of blood doesn't have higher attack rating but is arguably one of the most effective weapons in the game but if you're just talking about on an r1 swing you're usually gonna get the most damage out of colossal weapons secondly they have very high stance damage or stagger damage meaning that it's a very easy to stagger bosses or enemies with this weapon type allowing you to get critical strikes or to attack enemies while they're rendered helpless there are also a wide variety of colossal weapons to choose from there are 15 in this weapon group 10 of which you are unique so that gives you a lot of choices if you want to use colossal weapon another pro to this weapon class that i want to mention is that when you go to do a critical attack like after you stagger an enemy or if you're doing a backstab or something like that you'll actually trigger assassins cerulean dagger or assassin's crimson dagger twice if you have them equipped for whatever reason i don't know if this is a bug it's been in the game the whole time so i'm assuming it's not at this point but this is something that doesn't happen to all weapon classes colossal swords for instance only trigger this once and this is fantastic because this means you're going to get like 30 fp back and a lot of health back when you do a critical strike with this weapon class meaning that you probably want to lean into staggering or doing back stabs if you can because this will give you a huge advantage in maintaining your fp and health and lastly even though the sustained dps of this weapon group is maybe not the highest out of all they have the highest burst potential because of that high attack rating meaning that you can probably get the most damage out of one swing and you're more likely to make a one-shot build or a build that kills regular or modestly regular enemies in one swing if you set properly the cons of this weapon type are that it is the heaviest weapon category in the game meaning that you need a good amount of equip load in order to wield these without you know fat rolling or maybe being overweight so you have to plan for not only the high strength requirements for these weapons in a lot of cases but also for that weight meaning that you're gonna need a good amount of endurance to use them they also have the slowest attack speed of all weapons which makes them not quite as good in scenarios or maybe you're outnumbered if you don't have a lot of poise because you can get interrupted via repeated attacks so you sort of have to plan for that and know that you're not going to just chain hits in a row and this also makes them maybe not quite as good at setting status effects because you can't hit rapidly even though they have very high status effect build up per swing because you can't hit very quickly in a row it takes longer to build up those status effects another negative of this weapon class is the high stamina consumption per swing if you're swinging this weapon over and over you're gonna run on a stamina very fast in a lot of cases it's like two swings maybe three swings depending on your stamina and you're out of stamina and if you mix in a block or a roll in there then you're probably talking about two or less swings in most cases and the last negative is that most of these weapons are found halfway through the game or later meaning that if you have a particular colossal weapon you want to use it's gonna be a while before you actually acquire it and are able to lean into the build that you want moving along to the first of our unique colossal weapons is the grey club the great club has a unique r2 overhead swing that can be followed up with another and deals physical damage it's one of the lightest colossal weapons in l ringwing 17 and requires a lot of points and strength in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it drops from the stone digger troll and old altus tunnel which isn't as far into the game as some colossal weapons and it can be buffed with grease or other weapon buffs despite not being infusible with ashes of war the cons of this weapon are that it has a shorter length for a colossal weapon though longer than some and it can't be infused with ash's war the great club has much lower attack rating than most colossal weapons making it seem like a poor choice at first glance however despite being a unique class weapon it can still be buffed with spells or other weapon buffs allowing you to increase your attack rating much higher additionally golden land its weapons skill will apply blood flame blade or black flame blade to its projectiles if you buff with either of these spells making them a good pairing for this weapon golden land also does 100 holy damage and increases in damage the more faith you have making the great club an ideal choice for a strength faith build by using the claw mark seal you can still sling most spells effectively and buff your weapon just keep in mind that the strength scaling from the claw mark seal will not apply to your weapon buff damage even still with 50 strength and 50 faith you come out with a whopping 896 attack rating if you buff with both golden foul and electrify armament which puts it up there with some of the higher damage dealing colossal weapons and you can cast incantations to boot like golden vowel which also boosts golden land's damage i highly recommend you do a split strength faith build when using this weapon for the reasons mentioned otherwise you'll really be limiting your damage and versatility however the other option is to use this weapon in some sort of jump attack build with another lighter colossal weapon like the troll's hammer and only invest in strength i definitely recommend this weapon in ng plus and beyond because you'll have many more points you can place into strength and faith to further boost your attack rating as well as weapon buff damage and spell damage on into ng plus plus and beyond the next uni colossal weapon is troll's hammer the troll's hammer shares the default moveset of most colossal weapons and deals physical and fire damage it's the lightest colossal weapon in eldon ringwaying 16 and requires a lot of points in strength and some dexterity and faith in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it's found in the old altus tunnel which isn't as far into the game as some colossal weapons and it's the lightest colossal weapon in elden ring tied with the dragon great claw and it has very high attack rating for being such a light weapon the downsides are that it has a short length for colossal weapons although it's longer than some and it cannot be infused with an ash of war the trolls hammer is in a weird spot for a colossal weapon it does very little fire damage and the faith scaling is extremely poor making it unlikely to be used in any sort of strength-based build however it does have very high attack rating for its weight particularly when two-handed you get about the same damage with the sacred-infused giant crusher which has the same length better scaling and has the option of various different ashes of war the giant crusher though has much higher requirements and weighs a lot more so there are some trade-offs trolls roar deals only physical damage with its shout meaning it doesn't use any of the fire damage of this weapon for its calculation since troll's war can be placed on many different weapons it's better to be used on an all-physical damage colossal weapon if you like this ash of war troll's roar and its follow-up attack are both boosted by the roar medallion and highlander axe if you really want to use this weapon you'll want to increase your strength to 80 while meeting the minimum requirements for dexterity and faith which is extremely easy to do i'd suggest making a similar build to the colossal crusher build with this weapon that takes advantage of trolls roar and the double proc of assassins cerulean and crimson daggers or you could make a build with another light colossal weapon like the great club doing dual wheel jump attacks since they are much lighter than many colossal weapons i don't recommend this weapon for ng plus and beyond because of the poor faith scaling and you'll have about 90 percent of its total potential attack rating by the time you finish new game next up is the dragon grade claw the dragon grey claw shares the default moveset of most colossal weapons and deals physical and lightning damage it's the lightest colossal weapon in eldon ring wings 16 and requires a lot of points in strength and some in dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it deals 30 percent damage against dragon type enemies it deals plus 15 damage against ancient dragon type enemies it's slightly longer than most other colossal weapons it's the lightest colossal weapon in elden ring tied with troll's hammer and has high attack rating for its weight the negatives of this weapon are that it cannot be infused with ashes of war and is found somewhat late into the game dropping from the draconic tree sentinel in capital outskirts the dragon great claw does a similar amount of damage to the troll's hammer both of which are the lightest two colossal weapons in elm ring however it deals lightning damage instead of fire and is a bit longer and deals extra damage versus dragons it also has a different ash of war endure that is far better in pvp than pbe since the best policy when facing bosses is to avoid damage altogether the fact that you cannot change the ash of war on this weapon and that it is so light makes it far better in a dual wield setup that places it in the offhand where it will not be used as often consider pairing it with the watchdog staff which has nearly identical requirements and scaling has a much better ash of war and is only slightly heavier the sweet spot for this weapon is 55 strength and 55 dexterity after which point it begins to drop off a bit but you'll still get decent damage all the way up to 80 in either of these stats making it a good candidate for new game plus where you will likely reach these numbers up next is the watchdog staff the watchdog staff shares the default moveset of most colossal weapons and deals physical damage it has an average weight for colossal weapons and elder ring weighing 19 and requires a lot of points in strength and summon dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it's longer than most other colossal weapons it's found rather early on in roads and catacombs and learning of the lakes and sorcery of the crow's ear the weapon skill of this provides an excellent ranged option with no investment in intelligence or faith the negatives of this weapon are that it cannot be infused with ashes of war and it has very low attack rating for its weight the watchdog staff sacrifices raw damage for a unique weapon skill that deals magic damage and tracks enemies dealing damage at range it's a great option for a melee build giving you a spell-like attack that you can use when you cannot get near a dangerous enemy this puts it into kind of a strange place because you have to decide whether to lean into sorcery or the crozier or if you want to focus on jump attacks with this weapon this is because talismans that benefit sorcery of the crozier don't really fit into a melee build things like ritual sword talisman magic scorpion charm and assassins cerulean dagger do nothing if all you focus on is jump attacks but they greatly benefit a build that focuses on this weapon skill note that shard of alexander doesn't boost the damage of this weapon skill although it really should the most unique thing about the watchdog staff is this weapon skill so in my opinion i'd focus on that like i did in my sorcery sentinel build or use another colossal weapon that has higher attack rating for a jump attack sort of build use the talisman's dimension in order to pump the damage of this skill and you can either 2-hand this weapon or try to dual-wield it with another light colossal weapon like dragon great claw if you wish the optimal stat spread for this weapon is about 60 strength and 50 dexterity which is very similar to the dragon great claw and it scales relatively well up to 80 in both stats making it a good candidate for new game plus the next unique class weapon is staff of the avatar the staff of the avatar shares the default moveset of most colossal weapons and deals physical and holy damage it has an average weight for a class weapon and elden ring weighing 20 and requires a lot of points in strength and some in dexterity and faith in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it's one of the longer colossal weapons in the game it has the highest potential attack rating of all unique weapons in eldon ring and it has 730 attack rating at minimum requirements which is very high the cons of this weapon are that it drops very late into the game from the urgery avatar in deep root depths you cannot infuse it with any ashes of war or change the affinity and holy damage is one of the worst damage types late game as some of the most difficult bosses resist it staff of the avatar has incredible attack rating and has the highest potential attack rating of all unique weapons in elven ring additionally it doesn't weigh nearly as much as some colossal weapons at 28 and is one of the longer colossal weapons in elder the downsides are that it does some holy damage and holy damage is one of the worst types of damage late in ellen ring and you don't get this weapon until very late into the game so you won't be able to use it for a very long time additionally er tree slam does about the same damage in a lot of cases as a jump attack making it very situational when enemies are clumped together or versus undead something particularly interesting about this weapon is that you get the highest attack rating in ng by pumping strength to 80 and keeping faith at 24 which is the minimum needed to meet its faith requirements however if you go for 50 strength and 50 faith and 2 hand the weapon you have nearly the same attack rating as if you two handed it with 80 strength and ergtree slam does slightly more damage with 50 faith making this the optimal stat spread if you're two handed this also allows you to play a strength faith build rather effectively using the claw mark seal which gives you a host of buffs that can further boost your defenses and damage as well as a variety of ranged options erg tree slammed as a mix of physical and holy damage allowing to increase its damage with flame grant me strength gold and bow holy shrouded cracked tear sacred scorpion charm as well as shard of alexander and ritual sword talisman this gives you a variety of ways to increase not only your entry slam but also your own attack rating since this weapon continues to scale decently with strength and faith and even dexterity adds an excellent candidate for ng plus and ng plus plus playthroughs since you can continue to increase your damage through both of these playthroughs next up we have the rotten staff the rotten staff shares the default moveset of most colossal weapons and deals physical damage it's one of the lightest colossal weapons in eldon ring wing 18 and requires a lot of points and strength and some dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it causes a scarlet rod build up with each hit and it's one of the longer colossal weapons in the game the downsides of this weapon are that it cannot be infused with ashes of war it drops extremely late in the game from the putrid avatar and mikkel as haligtri essentially making this an ng plus weapon it has low attack rating compared to staff of the avatar and lower than most other colossal weapons bird tree slam deals about 40 holy damage which isn't the greatest damage type and it has similar damage to the rotten great axe but with less versatility the rotten staff is a mixed bag on one hand you deal scarlet rot build up with each attack and it's one of the longer colossal weapons and on the other you deal less damage than just about every colossal weapon in ellen ring additionally erd tree slam deals both holy and physical damage however the weapon itself does not this means in order to boost or retreat slam's damage you will likely use something that increases holy damage which does not benefit your regular attacks unlike staff of the avatar the only way i can see to use this weapon the most effectively is to pair it with a rotten great axe and make a jump attack dual wheel build that focuses on scarlet rot build up as a secondary means of damage this would allow you to mainhand the rotten great acts with a much more effective ash of war and just forget about urgery slam use the mushroom crown and kindred of wrought's exaltation for boss fights to increase your attack rating to that of most other colossal weapons the sweet spot for this weapon is about 50 strength though it scales well up to 80 with minimum requirements and dexterity it does have ok scaling with dexterity however making it more viable for ng plus than some other weapons though not the greatest choice next up for unique loss weapons is envoy's great horn the envoy's great horn shares the default moveset of most colossal weapons and deals physical and holy damage it has an average weight for a colossal weapon in elden ring weighing 19.5 and requires some points in strength dexterity and faith in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that great ocular bubble its weapon skill does incredible damage when built properly the negatives of this weapon are that it's found extremely late in the game dropping from the giant envoys and miklos halig tree essentially making it an ng plus weapon and it can take a very long time to farm this weapon and holy damage is one of the worst damage types late in the game as some of the most difficult bosses resist it it's also the second shortest weapon of the colossal weapon group and has very low attack rating for a colossal weapon while initially it might seem like a terrible weapon because it has low attack rating short range and deals some holy damage which was resisted by many end game bosses envoy's great horn can be devastating if built to maximize its weapons skill great ocular bubble great ocular bubble does 100 holy damage and can be increased with shard of alexander sacred scorpion charm ritual sword talisman holy shroud and crack tear golden vowel your faith attribute and the unique helmet on voice crown this allows you to approach 4 000 damage at 50 faith which is phenomenal for a weapon skill that can be fired off at range and while envoy's great horn has slightly better attack rating at 80 strength and 24 faith you'll gain more damage from great ocular bubble by splitting 50 strength and 50 faith this will allow you to use the claw mark seal and cast incantation someone effectively while still having 95 of the attack rating much like the staff of avatar because you can continue to increase strength to 80 rather effectively and faith decently envoy's great horn makes a decent weapon for ng plus particularly because holy damage is much better at the beginning of a playthrough than the n but will start to fall off an ng plus plus next up we have giza's wheel the giza's wheel has r2 attacks that leave the blade spinning dealing extra damage and deals physical damage as an average weight for a class weapon and eldon ring weighing 19 and requires a lot of points in strength and summon dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it's the second longest length of all colossal weapons tied with golem's halberd it causes blood loss buildup on each hit and it's the only colossal weapon that does the r2 attacks of this weapon leave the blade spinning for extra hits which does trigger winged sword insignia rotten wing sword insignia millicent's prosthesis and thorny crack tier the negatives of this weapon are that it cannot be infused with an ash of war it's found late into the game by defeating inquisitor giza in volcano manor spinning will the weapons skill this weapon doesn't trigger wing sword insignia rotten wing sword insignia millicent's prosthesis nor thorny crack tier and spinning wheel does very little bleed build up for hit less than is on the weapon that's listed giza's wheel is an interesting weapon because of its ash of war and the weapon itself should remind players of the whirligig saw from bloodborne colloquially nicknamed the pizza cutter what's funny is that spinning wheel does far less damage and bleed buildup than a single charged r2 with geez's wheel when sword insignia rotten wings sword insignia millicent's prosthesis nor thorny cracked here will trigger when using spinning wheel and bleed build up is but a fraction of the per hit of what's listed on the weapon this renders spinning wheel nearly useless however r2 attacks trigger blood loss much more easily than spinning wheel and they are affected by these talismans and crack tier in addition to the axe talisman making it particularly deadly at 50 strength and 55 dexterity you can deal over 3 000 damage in a single charge to r2 if hemorrhage triggers if you insist on using this weapon this is the way to use it successfully pair this with the jellyfish shield for even better results giza's wheel has nearly identical scaling with strength and dexterity meaning 5050 is the optimal setup for this weapon and it will continue to scale well up to 80 in each making it a phenomenal choice for ng plus and onward the next unique colossal weapon is falling star beast jaw the falling star beast josh shares the default moveset of most colossal weapons and deals physical and magic damage it's one of the heavier colossal weapons in elden ring weighing 21.5 and requires a lot of points in strength and some dexterity and intelligence in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it deals plus 20 damage to gravity type enemies gravity bull is one of the most devastating weapon skills in all of elden ring trivializing much of the game it has the longest reach of all colossal weapons and has very high attack rating the downsides of this weapon are that it cannot be infused with ashes of war it's found late in the game dropping from the full-grown falling star beast in mount gelmer and it has poor intelligence scaling the strength of the falling star beast jaw is easily its weapon skill gravity bolt which deals physical and magic damage at range in a small aoe that staggers most enemies in one cast and the rest in two or three this allows you to stun lock bosses and tough enemies without ever taking damage in a lot of cases and can make the game a cake walk if you're set up correctly like i did in my gravity god build additionally this weapon has one of the highest attack ratings of all colossal weapons deals extra damage to gravity type enemies and has the longest reach of all colossal weapons the one downside is that intelligence skills vary poorly with this weapon and you'd be better off thinking of it as a quality scaling weapon once you meet the intelligence requirements the falling star beast jaw scales very well with strength and dexterity with the sweet spot being about 50 in each with only 20 points in intelligence to meet its requirements this weapon should be fine in ng plus because there is room to increase the damage by increasing both strength and dexterity up to 80 and the stagger this weapon does prevents enemies and bosses from even getting to you anyway and the last unique colossal weapon is acts of godfrey the axe of godfrey shares the default moveset of most clause weapons and deals physical damage it's one of the lightest colossal weapons in elder ring wing 18 and requires a lot of points and strength and summon dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it has very high attack rating when buffed with regal roar regal roar can aoe down packs of enemies rather easily knocks enemies into the air and has hyper armor that is almost unbreakable the downsides of this weapon are that it cannot be infused with ashes of war it's found near the very end of the game by exchanging a remembrance from one of the last bosses it has the second shortest reach of colossal weapons in elden ring tied with envoy's great horn and regal roar's damage buff only lasts 20 seconds and has a very long cast time and finally the damage does not increase with roar medallion nor godfrey icon although it really should while the axe of godfrey might seem unwieldy because of its slow casting animation of regal roar its hyper armor makes it almost impossible not to pull it off and since it knocks enemies into the air it allows for a follow up charge to r2 rather easily that will usually finish up any regular or elite enemies due to its higher than average attack rating when buffed you'll definitely want very high armor and poise when using this weapon if possible to make sure you can create damage easily and just keep swinging usually killing enemies before they can attack the second time what's weird though is although shard of alexander and axe talisman are both useful for this weapon skill roar medallion and godfrey icon both do not enhance it one bit this is quite odd considering it's literally labeled a roar but it still deals significant damage anyhow the sweet spot for this weapon is around 60 strength and 50 dexterity though you can continue to boost these stats to 80 into ng plus making it a good choice for a second playthrough particularly since you won't get this until the very end of the game anyway it's a very underutilized and underrated weapon i advise simply two handing this weapon instead of using it in dual wield setup simply because you need to use the r2 and charge r2 attacks after you use regal roar or there's really no reason in using this weapon and that does not take the offhand into account moving on to the non-unique colossal weapons the first one is the duelist great axe the duelist great act shares the default moveset of most clause weapons and deals physical damage it has an average weight for a colossal weapon and elder ring weighing 20 and requires a lot of points in strength and some dexterity in order to will the pros of this weapon are that it can be infused with ashes of war and it has about the same or more attack rating when compared to unique colossal weapons the cons are that it's not found until very late into the game in lendel royal capital and is missable and it has the shortest length of all colossal weapons tied with the rotten great axe the advantage of the duelist great axe is that it has rather high attack rating and the flexibility to change different ashes of war and it deals slash damage compared to the strike damage of most colossal weapons slash is not a better damage type than strike in general but it does give you another option if an enemy does resist strike damage you'll get the most damage out of this weapon with the fire and lightning infusions followed by sacred and flame art and magic and then cold and keen the duelist great acts and the rotten great acts lean towards the dexterity scaling side of things making them a better option for dual wielding since they don't have as good of strength scaling as some other colossal weapons consider dual wielding two of these weapons and using a dexterity scaling ash of war like thunderbolt or beast roar to give you a ranged option that scales well with dexterity remember that cold infusion still has b scaling and dexterity with this weapon so it's still a valid option if you use beast roar the sweet spot for damage of this weapon is about 50 dexterity and 30 strength which is needed in order to wield at one handa you can continue to increase the damage up to 80 dexterity rather easily and if you use cold you can increase strength and intelligence as well making this a solid choice for ng plus next up is the rotten great axe the rotten great act shares the default moveset of most cost weapons and deals physical damage it has an average weight for a clausal weapon and ellen ring wang 20 and requires a lot of points in strength and summon dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it applies scarlet rot build up with each hit and it can be infused with ashes of war the cons are that it's not found until very late into the game and ordina liturgical town it has the shortest length of all colossal weapons tied with duelist great acts and has slightly less damage on average than most unique clause weapons the only reason to use the rotten great axe over the duelist great acts besides the fact that you may have missed the duelist great axe is that you want the scarlet rot build up on it it's not a bad trade-off really a bit less attack rating for scarlet rod however it won't be very useful against regular enemies since they will usually die before you can trigger it and you will likely need to use a dual build setup in order to get this to proc more easily since there is no way to boost the rate at which you build up scarlet rot besides adding a second source or by using an ash of war that strikes rapidly since there really isn't an ash of war like this for colossal weapons you're kind of locked into the dual world route i advise farming a second rotten great axe that way you can set yourself exactly how you want and just like the duelist great axe this weapon scales more with dexterity than strength making it ideal for a dual-wield build you could actually set both to poison infusion and trigger both poison and scarlet rods simultaneously this will allow you to make good use of the mushroom crown and kidron of rot's exaltation which will increase your attack power by 30 for 20 seconds which puts your attack rating even higher than if you were a higher damage infusion note that setting the bleed infusion sets scarlet rot to zero so we don't try and use it here the sweet spot for this weapon is the same as the duelist great axe at 50 dexterity and 30 strength and if you're using the poison infusion you'll want to continue to increase dexterity to 80 from here before investing in arcane to further boost damage and increase the rate at which poison builds up but not scarlet rot it's not super important to do this earlier because unlike hemorrhage you cannot trigger poison a second time until it expires so building at half a swing earlier is not a big deal because of the versatility of this weapon and the fact that it scales well in many cases it's an excellent weapon for ng plus and onward particularly because scarlet rot will become more useful as enemies gain more hp and become more challenging next up is golem's halberd the golems albert has a unique r2 that does horizontal slashes rather than overhead strikes and deals physical damage it's one of the heavier colossal weapons in elder ring weighing 21.5 and requires a lot of points in strength and summon dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it can be infused with ashes of war it's the second longest of all colossal weapons it deals about the same or more damage as most unique colossal weapons and it can be found quite early in elden ring by farming golems on the path to the divine tower of limgrave the cons of this weapon are that it's one of the heavier colossal weapons in eldon ring you can't change the ash of war on this weapon without losing charge 4th since you cannot put this ash of war back onto this weapon class charge 4th although hitting multiple times does not trigger wing sword insignia or millicent's prosthesis and also charge 4 if there's very little stagger damage when i first started testing this weapon i really wanted to use charge 4th since it's an ash of war not found or applicable to any other colossal weapon however when i started trying to optimize it i soon realized that even though charge 4th hits multiple times the game only counts them as 1 hit and so does not trigger bleeder poison buildup faster nor does it trigger winged sword insignia or millicent's prosthesis this was a major letdown alone but when coupled with the fact that it does nearly no stagger damage became clear you could get more damage out of just charged r2s with this weapon than its ash of war so why then would you use the golem's halberd well it has fantastic strength scaling and has the second longest reach of all colossal weapons and it has the versatility of being able to change ashes of war and set status effects what i decided to do with this weapon was actually a block counter build and that's because it has extremely long range allowing you to hit even when pushed back it has very high damage allowing you to hit very hard with block counters it also scales well with strength making it a good candidate to pair with a great shield when you use this in combination with the curved sword talisman and things like determination or royal night's resolve you one shot most enemies in one block counter but if for some reason you don't well you usually stagger them and then you can trigger assassins cerulean and crimson daggers twice due to it being a colossal weapon it's sort of the apex of block counter builds the ideal stat spread for this weapon is somewhere around 50 strength but you can take this up to 80 no problem and probably even higher since it has a scaling when set to heavy additionally bleed and cold both have b scaling and strength so are not bad options either particularly in ng plus when enemy health pools increase next up we have the giant crusher the giant crusher has a unique r2 that causes the wielder to somersault forward and can flatten regular enemies if charged and deals physical damage it's the heaviest weapon in the elden ring weighing 26.5 and requires a huge amount of strength in order to will the pros of this weapon are that it can be acquired earlier than most colossal weapons in elden ring and altus plateau it can be infused with ashes of war it has the best strength scaling of all class weapons and highest potential attack rating of all infusible colossal weapons when using heavy cold blood or poison scaling and it has very good physical damage reduction and guard boost making it decent at blocking in a pinch the cons of this weapon are that it has short length for a colossal weapon though longer than some and it's the heaviest weapon in eldon ring the giant crusher has outstanding attack rating as well as a unique r2 that can flatten enemies it has the highest potential attack rating of all infusible colossal weapons when using any infusion that uses strength in its scaling like heavy cold or blood or poison and because the giant crusher requires such a large investment into strength in order to use you're better off using one of these infusions if you use this weapon the downsides of this weapon are that it is the heaviest weapon in the game weighing a whopping 26.5 and it is shorter than nearly every other colossal weapon and elden ring this means you'll have to have a large investment into endurance to use it and when added with the strength requirements it doesn't leave a lot of room for any other points except into vigor and mine you also need to be closer to your target though the charged r2 has a decent amount of range unless you intend to buff this weapon with grease or some buff that requires low requirements like frozen weapon or blood flame blade i highly recommend selecting the cold infusion as it is nearly the same damage as heavy but can also apply the frostbite status effect ripping off enemy hp and reducing enemy resistances additionally using the blood infusion is not a bad option either especially if you're using white mask and lord of love's exultation since one bleed proc will effectively recoup the lost attack rating from selecting this infusion the giant crusher has very high damage and excellent scaling making it a good choice for ng plus and onward because you can continue to increase its attack rating via strength in the majority of cases consider using ash's award like determination a royal night's resolve with this weapon and using the axe talisman to take advantage of its unique r2 attack for very high damage and finally we come to the last colossal weapon which is the prelate infernal crozier the pellets inferno crozier has a unique r2 that is an upward swing that can launch enemies into the area of charge and deals physical damage it's one of the heaviest colossal weapons in elden ring weighing 23.5 and requires a lot of points in strength and some dexterity in order to will the pros of this weapon are that it can be infused with ashes of war the charged r2 attacks with this weapon launch enemies into the air it has better attack rating than most colossal weapons prelat's charge triggers winged sword insignia and militant's prosthesis easily and finally prelat's charge can sunlock enemies the cons of this weapon are that it isn't found until much later in the game by farming the fire pellet and mount gelmer it has short length for a colossal weapon though longer than some and charged r2 attacks with this weapon deal much less stagger damage than other colossal weapons that are blocked much like other colostal weapons the prelats inferno crozier scales tremendously with strength and has one of the highest attack ratings of all colossal weapons in elven ring additionally it has a unique r2 that does less stagger damage in exchange for golf clubbing enemies into the air the unique thing about this weapon besides its shape is that it comes with the pellets charged weapon skill which you cannot find until much later in the game pillage charge allows you to hit rapidly over and over by holding l2 which can trigger wing's sword insignia rotten wings sword insignia and millicent's prosthesis extremely quickly additionally if the weapon is buffed with blood flame blade it can trigger hemorrhage quite fast as well when combined this creates a deadly combination that can reach over 2200 attack rating and likely higher in some scenarios and can unlock enemies in the process while you gain the highest outright attack rating by pumping strength if you place at least 25 points into faith you'll be able to use blood flame blade which can trigger hemorrhage you'll be able to buff with flame grant me strength and you'll be able to buff with golden bath when these buffs combine with the talismans i just mentioned word of blood's exaltation and white mask you can hit incredibly high attack ratings by using this together this will then buff your few next attacks allowing you to kill enemies with r1 or r2 attacks for a little while because this weapon has such good strength scaling and high attack rating it performs extremely well in ng plus and beyond especially since you can set it to blood or cold infusions both of which take portions of max hp off when their status effects trigger and since enemies and these difficulties increase their hp this only gets stronger and stronger as you increase the ng plus well that wraps up our video on colossal weapons what did you guys think of the video did i get a lot of information there for you what other tips do you guys have for colossal weapons which ones are you guys using let me know in the comments below [Music] [Music] [Music]

Title: Halberds are the Best Weapon in Elden Ring - Elden Ring All Halberds Breakdown
Video ID: JHHqzMAauJU
Transcript Text:
in the cell ring video i'm going to be showing you why halberds are the best weapon in eldon ring this is the seventh video in our series where we dissect all the weapons in a given weapon category go through their pros and cons and show you why you may or may not use them in your build before that however i want to talk about the pros and cons of this weapon class in general and the styles of play that most players are likely to use when using these weapons the pros of this weapon type are that they typically have longer reach than most other weapons they tend to make enemies flinch when you hit with them allowing you to hit repeatedly without getting attacked in a lot of cases and they usually have pretty high attack rating for the weight that they are the downsides of this weapon class are that they tend to attack slower than a lot of other weapon classes in the game and their block counters are much slower than some others the styles of play available to this weapon class are also a lot wider in my opinion than maybe some other classes you'll probably see people using all different styles you'll see people dual wielding them in jump attacks people using single uh halberds leaning into the weapon skill you use people hybriding into some sort of spell casting build using the dragon convenience seal in a lot of cases or the claw mark seal and you might even see people using a great shield and using one in one hand you know doing block counters and leaning into the fast r1 attacks of some of the halvers that can be used i think this is one of the more unique thing about halberds is that they have so many variances from halberd to howard in terms of what their r1 attack is what their r2 attack is what their strengths and weaknesses are that it's hard to categorize all these weapons together into one thing but as i mentioned earlier there are some pros and cons but this class has like a wider variance than maybe some other weapon types so let's jump into the unique halberds first and first up is the gargoyle's black halberd the gargoyle's black halberd shares the default moveset of most alberts and deals physical and holy damage it has a heavy weight for halberd and elden ring wang 12 and requires a lot of points in strength and faith and some points in dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it has very high attack rating which will continue to increase into ng plus and beyond it has 715 attack rating approximately at minimum requirements which is extremely high it's dropped by the black blade kindred which isn't too far into the game in caled compared to some halberds the cons of this weapon are that it deals a lot of holy damage which is resisted by many end game bosses you cannot change the ash of war on this weapon and it has poor scaling making it better earlier in the game than later much like other gargoyle's black weapons the gargles black halberd has exceptional attack rating but very poor scaling making it much better early on in eldon ring than later additionally holy damage is resisted by difficult bosses later on in the game further reinforcing this concept a big negative of this weapon besides the holy damage is that you cannot change the ash of war spinning slash and while this is certainly not the worst dash of war one charged r2 of this weapon does nearly the same thing this will result in very situational uses of the sasha war though it can be used a bit faster than a charged r2 the sweet spot for this weapon is around 50 strength 50 faith and 50 dexterity though the faith and dexterity scaling is rather poor with this weapon however this gives the weapon very high attack rating and one that can continue to increase through ng plus and ng plus plus making it a decent option for successive playthroughs because this is a strength faith weapon primarily it makes a great candidate for the claw mark seal to cast incantations when not two handing it so consider using this if you use this weapon another option is using it with a great shield since you have high strength using block counters if you want next up is the ripple crescent halberd the ripple crescent halberd shares the default moveset of most halberds and deals physical damage it has a light weight for a halberd and ellen ring weighing 8.5 and requires some points in strength dexterity and arcane in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that can be buffed with weapon buffs despite being a unique weapon it has fantastic arcane scaling it can be found very early on in the game dropping from alvin arks and learning of the lakes and it has the third longest reach of the halberds in eldon ring the negatives of this weapon are that it has low attack rating compared to most other halberds the ripple crescent howard is unique because it has 100 arcane scaling does entirely physical damage can be buffed with weapon buffs like electrify armament or blood flame blade and has exceptional length making it easy to hit enemies however it has very low attack rating compared to other halvards even when it's buffed making it a poor choice for any pure melee style of build this weapon scales exceptionally well up to 80 arcane however i don't advise taking it that high early on and there are a couple reasons for that first incantations that buff weapon damage only use the fate stat to determine their damage so if you use electrify armament with little to no faith in all arcane it will be much less effective second the dragon communion seal soft caps around 45 arcane so going much higher won't result in much increased performance and increasing faith will actually outperform arcane past this point third incantations require faith in order to use so you'll need some faith anyway if you're planning to cast spells when using this weapon which you should be since the dragon convenience seal is perfect for doing this and finally you'll actually do more damage by splitting your attributes between arcane and faith when you're buffed with golden bow and some sort of weapon buff like electrify armament for this reason i advise something like 45 arcane and 45 faith and using dragon incantations golden foul and any other weapon incantation buffs or incantations you like this will give you more attack rating than just going all arcane and will provide you with the versatility to use dragon and can patience effectively you can also pair it with the vulgar malicious saw in your offhand for a jump attack build that can cast spells and sets hemorrhage rather easily next up is the golden halberd the golden halberd shares a unique r2 with the luzerne and knight raider glaive that does an overhead strike and deals physical and holy damage it has the heaviest weight for a halberd and eldon ring weighing 13.5 and requires a lot of points and strength and some points in faith and dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it has good strength scaling it has the highest attack rating of all halberds which will continue to increase into ng plus and beyond and drops extremely early in the game from the tree sentinel and limb grant the negatives of this weapon are that it's the heaviest halberd in the game you cannot change the ash of war gold and vow and the skill is less effective than the spell and it deals a lot of holy damage which is resisted by many end game bosses the attack rating of the gold and halberd is one of the highest in elden ring particularly when you compare it against its weight which is almost half as light as most weapons that deal the same damage however it's sort of in a weird place because you get the most damage from it around 55 strength and 45 faith which allows you to use the golden vowel incantation easily because this only requires 25 faith but this weapon's ash of war is golden bow and the skill version is actually a little bit less effective than the incantation this makes the ash of war a bit redundant once you have the incantation but what this does allow you to do is make a jump attack halberd build that uses two halberds that can buff mid combat without having to swap to a sacred seal which can come in handy in aggressive boss situations i highly recommend using their gargoyle's black halvert in your offhand if you do this because it has similar scaling damage and damage types much like the gargoyle's black halberd the golden halberd makes a good candidate for the claw mark seal since you'll have high strength and fate and this allows you to play a hybrid build using this weapon naturally you can also use a great shield with this setup if you wish using a good ash of war on the shield instead like barricade shield crashing shield or holy ground this sort of allows you to mask the golden halberd's weakness which is its golden vowel ash and since you have solid strength scaling you can increase the damage of this weapon into ng plus and beyond very well making it a great choice for successive playthroughs next up we have the dragon halber the dragon halberd thrusts with its r1 attack instead of slashing much like the halberd banished knights halberd and commander's standard weapons and deals physical damage it has an average weight for a halberd and eldon ring weighing 10.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that spinning slash buffs the weapon with ice lightning for 20 seconds adding 130 lightning damage and 80 frost buildup it has very high attack rating when buffed with ice lightning it can be found relatively early on in elden ring by defeating the dragonkin soldier in siafra river quality scaling allows it to be very effective in ng plus and beyond and finally you can use the spear talisman effectively due to thrusting r1 attacks the negatives of this weapon are that it has average attack rating when not buffed when compared with other halberds it's one of the shortest halberds in the game and the r1 attacks can often miss off to the right of the enemy quite easily if they're even slightly mobile the dragon halberd is an interesting weapon because it doesn't seem that great at first glance it has a relatively low attack rating for a halberd you cannot change the ash of war spinning slash and you cannot apply weapon buffs to this weapon like grease or lightning armament however because spinning slash buffs the weapon itself it becomes much more potent after using this this catapults the dragon halberd to near top of the list of halberds in terms of total attack rating while buffed and it has very solid scaling to boot allowing it to catch up or surpass many other halberds in ng plus and beyond additionally when compared to the dragon scale blade which also has this buff spinning slash is much easier to use and is likely something you'd use regularly anyway making the dragon halberd the easier of the two weapons to trigger ice lightning the sweet spot for this weapon is around 55 strength and 45 dexterity despite the b scaling and strength and c index dirty this makes this weapon more of a quality scaling weapon than strength opening up the door for even more damage at higher levels as i just mentioned i would personally pair this weapon with another cold infused halberd for a jump attack style build or simply two-handed leaning it into the ash of war that you'll have to use frequently in order to keep your weapon back make sure to use the spear talisman if you aren't using a jump attack build to take advantage of the thrusting r1 attacks increasing your overall damage the next unique halberd is loretta's warsicle loretta's war sickle shares a unique r1 with a guardian sword spear that has angled swings that are quite fast and deals physical and magic damage it has an average weight for halberd and elden ring weighing 10 and requires some points in strength intelligence and dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it has decent strength and dexterity scaling making it a good choice for ng plus it's the second longest halberd in eldon ring r1s have faster attack speed than all other halberds except guardian sword spear and loretta's slash provides hyper armor allowing you to tank through hits the negatives of this weapon are that it's located near the very end of the game essentially making this a new game plus weapon loretta's slash doesn't do as much damage with this weapon as with other halberds that use the ash of war and magic affinity and finally loretta slash doesn't do that much damage in general and it can be hard to land both hits loretta's war sickle is in a bit of a pickle because its weapon skill loretta's slash is also an ash of war that is more optimized on other infusible halberds set to the magic or cold affinities where will hit for much more damage it also doesn't have the highest attack rating for a halberd being in the middle of the pack making players wonder why you might use it however it has exceptional reach being the second longest halberd and attacks very quickly using the same moveset as the guardian sword spear this allows you to get off more attacks than most talbots in the same space of time and make use of talismans that reward you for attacking quickly like millicent's prosthesis or winged sword insignia the sweet spot for this weapon is around 45 strength 55 dexterity and 20 intelligence both strength and dexterity have similar scaling with dexterity slightly edging it out and intelligence lacking behind because of this i don't recommend using this weapon in a spellblade sort of build particularly because you cannot buff this weapon and instead suggest taking the quality route that i've done here the damage on this weapon will continue to increase throughout ng plus and on into ng plus plus and i advise simply using this weapon two-handed or with a great shield where you can block counter and still use the fast r1 attacks effectively you might even want to put an ash of war on your shield since loretta slash won't be as optimized as it could be with other halverts two other things that i forgot to mention that this weapon type is really good for are mounted combat and quality scaling this weapon type has one of the best mounted combat movesets in the game because its weapon attacks almost out in like a 30 to 45 degree angle which tends to hit anything to the sides of you rather easily and it attacks much faster than some weapons like great swords or whatever on horseback so you can get a lot of damage out you connect more regularly and you can swing faster and when it comes to the quality scaling it's one of the weapons in the game that will actually surpass heavier keen scaling with just about every single weapon in this class that can be infused with quality scaling at some point in ng plus or beyond when you reach about 60 or so strength and dexterity making it really really good for successive playthroughs and this brings us to the last unique halberd commander's standard the commander's standard thrusts with its r1 attack instead of slashing much like the halberd banished knights halberd and dragon halberd and deals physical damage it has a heavy weight for a halberd and elden ring weighing 11.5 and requires a lot of points in strength and summon dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that rallying standard allows you to buff your damage and defenses by 20 without any investment in faith it's the longest halberd and eldon ring and you can use the spear talisman effectively due to thrusting r1 attacks and is found relatively early in elden ring by defeating commander o'neill and the aeonia swamp in caled the negatives of this weapon are that rallying standard only lasts 30 seconds and has a long animation making it difficult to rebuff with mid combat rallying standard is quite expensive at 30 fp for a 30 second buff and finally it has lower attack rating than most other unique halberds and even some infusible halvards when not bought when buffed the commander's standard is in the middle of the pack in terms of attack rating but when unbuffed it's near the bottom because rallying standard has such a long animation in short duration it can be tedious to use while already engaged in combat since you risk being struck when using it and unlike the dragon halvard you don't do any damage when casting it so you can't buff an attack at the same time however it does have the longest rage of all halberds in ellen ring and its r1 attack is a thrust which allows you to take advantage of the spear talisman for increased damage the sweet spot for this weapon is around 50 strength but you can go up to 80 effectively and the dexterity scaling is not as bad as it may appear this weapon is ng plus effective but likely not much further than that since you won't be able to get much more damage out of this weapon past 80 strength and 50 dexterity if you plan to use this weapon i recommend a jump attack playstyle with this weapon in your right hand to use the buff easily and make sure to use the carrion filigreed crest to reduce the cost of this weapon skill by 25 percent or you will struggle with fp management issues or use it with a great shield since you already have very high strength and become a tanky god that has incredibly long block counter range and can make most enemies flinch with regular r1 attacks that wraps up the unique halbrids and now let's move on to the infusible ones first up is the halberd the halberd thrusts with its r1 attack instead of slashing much like the banished knights albert dragon halberd and commander standard and deals physical damage it has a light weight for a halberd and eldon ring weighing eight and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it's found extremely early on in the game from the nomadic merchant and north lim grave or after you start with a vagabond class that's very lightweight for a halberd and the r1 attack does pierce damage allowing you to use the spear talisman the negatives are that it has lower attack rating than most other alberts the main reason to use this weapon is because it can be found so early on in elder ring and the r1 thrust allows you to boost your damage with the spear talisman which wouldn't normally apply to most halberd attacks it's also one of two halberds with this r1 attack that can be outfitted with different ashes of war and it has better heavy scaling than the banished knights hall rid which is the other i'd only suggest using this weapon if you intend to use it two-handed with heavy scaling and you really like the thrusting r1 attack another thing i'd recommend is splitting your attributes between strength and faith which would allow you to take advantage of the good heavy scaling and still buff the weapon rather well with incantations like electrify armament the claw mark seal would also allow you to cast incantations effectively since it scales off both these attributes additionally using ashes of war that attack rapidly with talismans like winged sword insignia will produce very high damage because of the high attack rating of these weapons i wouldn't recommend this weapon in ng plus unless you go the strength faith route since you'll cap out on most of your damage around the end of your first playthrough if you go pure strength and banish knights halberd has better quality scaling and the same moveset if you don't want to go the faith route next up is the banished knights halberd the banished knights halberd thrusts with its r1 attack instead of slashing much like the halberd dragon halberd and commander's standard and deals physical damage it has a light weight for a halberd and ellen ring weighing eight and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to will the pros of this weapon are that i can be found relatively early on in eldon ring dropping from banished knights who wield this weapon in stormdale castle it outperforms the halberd with just about every infusion and has the same moveset it's one of the longer halberds in elven ring it's very lightweight for a halberd and the r1 attack does pierce damage allowing for the use of the spear talisman effectively the negative of this weapon is that it's in the bottom half of halberd attack rating with most infusions the banished knights halberd is an upgrade over the halberd in nearly every way it's longer it has higher attack rating in just about every case but it loses out when compared to the halberd's heavy scaling if you like the thrusting moveset of the halvard but you aren't using the heavy infusion or you just want a longer halberd and want to keep the freedom to use various actions of war then the banished knights halberd is a good choice the best infusions for this weapon are fire lightning and heavy with quality outperforming heavy and energy plus when you approach 58 or so in both strength and dexterity i suggest either using this weapon alone or using it in a jump attack style build next up is the luzerne the lucerne shares a unique r2 with the golden halberd and knight rider glaive that doesn't overhead strike and deals physical damage it has the lightest weight for halberd and elder ring weighing seven and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that can be found relatively early on and lure any of the lakes it's the lightest halberd and alden ring and it does chip damage through the block of an enemy the negatives of this weapon are that it's one of the shortest talbots in eldon ring and has the lowest attack rating of all halbers with most infusions while the chip damage of this weapon deals through the block of an enemy is useful in some cases in pve most enemies lower their guard often enough to attack you or you can get the drop on them with a weapons skill before they see you this makes it hard to justify using this weapon particularly when you sacrifice 100 or more attack rating versus just about every other halberd this weapon could come in handy in pvp where some opponents block allowing you to deal damage anyway slowly chipping away at their health and making them re-evaluate their strategy however the vulgar malicious chatel has much the same function deals much more damage and is only very slightly shorter making it hard to justify this weapon unless you really like the unique r2 moveset also determination and royal knight's resolve make a great choice with this weapon because even more damage can get through a shield this way much like the banished knights halberd fire and lightning take the top spots with heavy not far behind and quality pulling ahead in ng plus when you approach 60 or so in both strength and dexterity cold is also not a bad option during your first playthrough since it has nearly the same damage as heavy and also applies frostbite to the enemy next up is the glaive the glaive shares the default moveset of most halberds and deals physical damage it has an average weight for a halberd and elden ring weighing 10 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to will the pros of this weapon are that i can be found relatively early on in the game dropping from a skeleton near the church of vows and learning of the lakes it has higher attack rating than most other halberds and has a longer reach than most other alberts the downside is that it can take a while to farm the glaive is a great all-around halberd it has relatively high damage when compared with other infusible halberds it has fairly good length being longer than most other halberds and the quality scaling on it is exceptional in ng plus however there is nothing really unique about its movesetter range making it a good candidate for a jump attack build that doesn't consider these aspects as much or for a bill that just focuses on a particular ash of war as this removes the need for a good moveset it's also not a bad candidate for a hybrid and cantation build much like the halberd since it has exceptional strength scaling the next weapon is the vulgar malicious chatel the vulgar militia chatel shares the default moveset of most halberds and deals physical damage it has a light weight for a halberd and elderwing weighing eight and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it's located not too far into the game dropping from the enemies wielding this near beastial sanctum and kayla it's one of the lightest halberds and attacks deal chip damage through blocks and shields the negative is that it's one of the shortest halberds in the game much like the lucerne the major star of this weapon is its ability to go through the guard of an enemy and deal some damage however very few enemies in elder ring block making this weapon much more pvp centric than many others in the game and that not only deals much more damage than the lucerne but you can farm two of them allowing you to jump attack effectively through shields as well fire and lightning are both great candidates for this weapon and cold is also great options since it still retains b scaling and dexterity when using this infusion and blood retains a scaling and dexterity and just like other halberd's quality scaling will catch heavy at some point in ng plus or ng plus plus with enough strength and dexterity so make sure you swap this if you're going the all physical route next we have the vulgar malicious saw the vulgar militia thought shares the default moveset of most halberds and deals physical damage it has a light weight for a halberd and elder ring wang 8 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it's the only halberd that deals bleed buildup on a hit natively it's located not too far into the game dropping from the enemies wielding this near beastial sanctum and caled and you can farm two of them the con of this weapon is that it's the second shortest halberd and elven ring the vulgar militia saw is the only halber that has native bleed buildup on it making it the best option for a status effect build if you want to use a halberd for one particularly because you can use two if you want the damage on this weapon is also around the middle of the pack halberd wise meaning you don't lose out on that much damage to pick up the bleed which is great i'd either use two of these in a jump attack sort of build that focus on status effects or lean into an ash of war that can hit repeatedly like blood tax repeating thrusts or double slash you can stack dual statuses with either cold or poison or commit fully to bleeding with the occult infusion if you go a cold i highly recommend hybriding into casting using the dragon communion seal and pairing it with the ripple crescent halvard in the main hand because you can buff this with the blood flame blade from camtasia next up is guardian sword spear the guardian sword spear shares a unique r1 with loretta's worst sickle that has angled swings that are quite fast and deals physical damage it has an average weight for a halberd and elden ringwaying 9 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to will the pros of this weapon are that it has exceptionally high dexterity scaling and attack rating when set to key there's very fast r1 attacks that hit faster than all other halbrids besides loretta's war sickle it can be farmed somewhat early in the game in caled and you can farm two of them the guardian sword spear is arguably the best all-around infusible halberd and elden ring it's near the top in terms of attack rating it's in the middle of the pack when it comes to range and its attack speed is second to none additionally it looks [ __ ] awesome but what really makes this weapon stand out is its insane keen attack raiding and dexterity scaling when set to keem dexterity scaling plays a part in some ashes of war like thunderbolt for example making the guardian sword sphere perfect for these weapon skills another thing that makes this howard particularly strong is that it still has incredibly high damage one-handed allowing you to use a shield or steel in the offhand without sacrificing hardly any damage you can pair this with the jellyfish shield for very high damage r1 attacks or buff with gold and vowel and flame jeremy strength or both for some of the fastest damaging r1 attacks in all velvet ring this weapon works very well in that scenario and allows it to remain strong into ng plus and beyond you can also make a jump attack build with two of these if you want but i personally feel that its fast r1 attacks are the shining star next up is the gargoyle's halbrin the gargoyle's halberd shares the default moveset of most halberds and deals physical damage it has a heavy weight for a halberd and eldon ring weighing 12 and requires a lot of points in strength and summon dexterity in order to will the pros of this weapon are that it's pretty much tied for the highest attack rating of all infusible halberds with the knight rider glade the cons are that it's one of the heaviest halberds in eldon ring it's the shortest reach of all halberds and it's found further into the game than most halberds dropping from the gargoyle and lindell royal capital this halberd is pretty much tied with the knight rider glade for the most damage at every infusion slightly beating it out in the heavy infusion department however it is the shortest talbert in ellen ring and the knight rider glaive is much longer and can be acquired a bit sooner really the best reason to use the gargoyles halberd is because it does standard damage while the nightrider glave does slash not all enemies that are resistant to slash damage are resistant to standard damage like banished knights for example so it's not a bad idea to have both of these weapons if you go this route so that you can swap between them if an enemy is weak or resistant to one of these types if you're going to use the gargoyles halberd you want to either use the fire heavier cold infusions in order to take advantage of these infusions strength scaling if you go the heavy route i'd suggest using a strength faith build using the claw mark sealed since you come out with about the same amount of damage when buffed and it gives you the flexibility of incantations it also future proofs your build into ng plus since pure strength will cap out near the end of your first playthrough in terms of damage next we have the knight rider glaive the knight rider glaive shares a unique r2 with a golden halberd and lucerne that does an overhead strike it has a heavy weight for a halberd and elden ring weighing 12 and requires a lot of points in strength and summon dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it's pretty much tied for the highest attack rating of all infusible halberds with the gargoyles halberd it drops somewhat early in the game from the night's cavalry and learning of the lakes and it's the fourth longest halberd and eldon ring the negative is that it's one of the heaviest halberds in elder rank as i just mentioned the knight rider glaive has many advantages over the gargoyle's hal rid and also has exceptional strength scaling despite being slightly lower i'd play this weapon in a similar manner leading into the strong strength scaling to get the most out of it again hybriding with faith allows you to take this build into ng plus and beyond much more easily and is highly recommended if you plan to continue past your first playthrough also note that its r2 attack is not an aoe sweep like the gargoyle's halberd but instead an overhead smash that deals really good single target damage this makes this weapon strangely better at single enemies even though it's much longer than the gargoyle's halberd and lastly we have the pest glaive the pass glaive shares the default move set of many halvards and deals physical damage and has the lightest weight of for halberd and elden ring wang 7 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the pros of this weapon are that it's the lightest halberd and alden ring and it's located not too far into the game dropping from pests and caled the negatives are that it's the second lowest attack rating of all halberds and it's one of the shorter halberds and elton rank the pass glaive has very low attack rating compared with other halberds and elden ring though it does have decent keen and a cold scaling it also doesn't have particularly good reach making it less than optimal for almost every build you would make with a halberd my advice would be if you want to use this weapon go a cult and slap sapoku on it and try to proc bleed as often as you can with normal attacks triggering lord of blood's exaltation and white mask for higher attack rating well that wraps up our video on halberds what did you guys think of the video are there other tips you guys have about howards did i miss anything let us know in the comments below [Music] bye [Music] [Music]

Title: Curved Swords are the Best Weapon in Elden Ring - Elden Ring All Curved Swords Breakdown
Video ID: Da3Bs3ycMEs
Transcript Text:
in this eldering video I'm going to show you why curve swords are the best weapon in Elden ring this is our eighth video in a series where we go through every weapon in a given category and sort of break down their pros and cons and show you why you may or may not want to use it in your build before we get into the weapons themselves though I want to talk a little bit about curved swords their styles of play and the strengths and weaknesses of this weapon type curved swords have very fast attack speed and they actually have a six hit R1 combo making it one of the longest combo chains if not the longest combo chain in the game simply from pressing R1 they also have phenomenal dual wield combos with their L1 button presses running L1 notably does four hits rapidly as does the jumping L1 and the rolling all one does three hits rapidly and this allows you to set status effects more easily than some other weapon types because you can hit rapidly with these weapons building up the status Effect Bar of enemies quickly additionally this weapon class takes great advantage of talismans that increase your damage as you hit more and more like when sword Insignia Millicent's prosthesis and rotten Wing sword Insignia as well as the thorny cracked here all of these work very very well with this weapon class allowing you to get substantial attack Power from Just a few attacks this is also an extremely light weapon class allowing you to do a wield more easily than some other classes and the typical weight of these weapons is anywhere from about two and a half to five allowing you again to dual wield and wear very heavy armor that allows you good Poise that makes it harder for you to be interrupted while you're going to town with your L1 combos the downside to this weapon class is that they tend to do less damage than just about every other weapon class in the game except fists and daggers and they don't have that long of reach compared to something like twin blades that have much longer reach and also have very good status effect buildup they're a little short in the reach Department those things being said I think the most common playstyle with curve swords is obviously going to be dual wielding to lean into that running L1 and jumping L1 combos in order to set status effects or just to build up your attack power through repeated attacks and the way as I mentioned earlier but there is a case to use one-handed curved swords as well many of the curved swords like wing of Aston or magma blade have fantastic ashes of war that don't use that offhand in calculating their damage or increasing their effectiveness in any way so if you plan on using those ashes of War then do wielding is less of a necessity so there is a case for like a sword and board set up here or a spellblade type setup where you're using a seal or staff in one hand and you're using a curved sword in the other as well now that we've gotten those things out of the way let's jump into the curve swords themselves and let's start with the unique curve swords the first one is the magma Blade the magma blade shares the default moveset of most curved swords and Deals physical and fire damage it has a heavy weight for curve sword and Elden ring wank 4 and requires some points in strength dexterity and faith in order to wield the damage of the magma blade is slightly less than the fire gross Messer or Bandits fire curve sword but those weapons have longer reach require less stat investment no faith and can be found much earlier in the game this makes magma blade only better if you take it into NG plus where the scaling on it will eventually surpass 700 attack rating or if you plan to use its weapon scaled magma shower magma shower operates much the same way that spinning slash does but it drops magma on the ground that deals damage to enemies that touch it boosting its performance over a spinning slash in many cases it does both physical and fire damage which is increased by strength dexterity and Faith this allows it to remain competitive in terms of weapon skills and makes up somewhat for the magma blade shorter reach since the sweet spot for this weapon is about 50 strength 50 dexterity and 50 Faith this is a fantastic weapon for NG plus and Beyond since it scales much better with strength you'll begin there followed by faith and finally dexterity you can add the claw marks seal to any build you make using this weapon because of the high strength and Faith which will allow you to cast incantations somewhat effectively builds that would work well with this weapon are dual wielding with another fire infused curve sword for similar damage and scaling pairing it with another cold infused curved sword that will allow you to trigger frostbite over and over rather easily on bosses or using it with a great shield for block counter since you have rather high strength anyways and you only use one weapon when using back to shower next up is nox flowing sword the knox-long sword has a unique R2 shared with a shot tell and a clip shot tell that doesn't hit multiple enemies and cannot be roll canceled out of and Deals physical damage it has an average weight for a curve sword in Elden ring wing 3.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to will knock slowing sword is an interesting weapon that seems designed more for PVP than PVE this is because it has relatively low attack rating for a curved sword and the fact some of its damage slips through Shields isn't overly useful in many PVE situations additionally its weapon skill flowing form hits for an average amount of damage but has an incredibly wide and far hitbox making it very hard to dodge unless timed perfectly and some damage from flowing form will penetrate blocks as well which could lend itself well to PVP however it can be used effectively in PVE as well this weapon shines at 50 dexterity making it a better first playthrough weapon than the NG Plus or Beyond once you hit 80 deck charity you really won't get too much more damage out of the weapon without serious stat investment which should put you near the end of Journey 1 or the very beginning of Journey 2 so it doesn't make a very good NG plus weapon I'd play this weapon with another curved sword possibly the shop teller clip shot tell from Maximum block penetration if you plan to PVP or you can use it with a shield for Block counters using the flowing form weapon skill to handle larger groups of enemies effectively because of its very long range and because flowing form causes most enemy to Flinch when struck just make sure to have high pulleys to prevent interruptions since it has a rather long wind up next up we have the wing of Aston the wing of Astral fires a projectile when using its heavy attack and fires too if fully charged and Deals physical and Magic damage it has a lightweight for a curved sword and Elden ring wing 2.5 and requires some points in strength dexterity and intelligence in order to wield wigavastal is a fantastic curve sword not only because it has unique R2 that fires projectiles but also because nebula is one of the deadliest weapon skills in the game the attack rating is not bad either at 588 particularly when you realize the weapon weighs only 2.5 there is a bit of a dilemma with this weapon though and this is that the R2 projectiles and nebula both feel 100 magic damage which only increase with the intelligent stat however wing of astle does more damage itself if you split your attribute points between intelligence and dexterity so you have to decide to which is more important to you regular tax and block counters or nebula and R2 slash charged r2s and build accordingly I chose a more balanced approached in my nebula night build but you could just as easily favor intelligence and use wing of astle in a spellblade sort of build that can also cast spells my argument internally against doing this was if you have nebula do you really need magic spells but that of course is up to you just make sure to use magic scorpion charm magic shroud and cracked here and Terra Magica if you can to further boost your damage regardless since this weapon shines around 50 dexterity and 50 intelligence but scales well up to 80 intelligence you'll be able to take this weapon into NGO plus rather easily particularly because nebula is such a strong weapon skill remember that if you use it in a narrow Corridor the cluster of stars Will Group up and when you use it in Open Spaces they will fan out and also that it does increase damage to gravity type enemies by plus 20 the last unique curve sword is the eclipse chatel the eclipse shot tell as unique R2 shared with the chatel and Knox flowing sword that doesn't hit multiple times and cannot be rolled canceled out of and Deals physical and holy damage it has a light weight for a curved sword and Elden ring wing three and requires some points in strength and a lot of points in dexterity and faith in order to wield the eclipse shot tell is almost exclusively a PVP weapon not only does it deal damage through blocks but death flare adds the death blight effect to weapon attacks which kills enemy players instantly if they are struck too many times with it death blight has no effect in PVE for this reason I'd advise using this weapon only in PvP The Sweet Spot for this weapon is around 50 dexterity and 50 Faith which will get you in a okay attack rating of around 584 damage which will increase by a small amount when buffed with death flare the holy damage added by this buff increases with your faith attribute but by such a small amount it isn't worth focusing on death flare itself deals wholly and physical damage with its follow-up attack increasing in damage with strength dexterity and fate however scaling with all three attributes it still only deals mediocre damage even if built to maximize its damage completely for this reason and because it's difficult to land in PvP I advise not worrying about this weapon skill if you're looking to use this weapon in PvP I highly advise you pair it with something like via's Mist in order to add more death blight build up even if you have two of this weapon you won't be able to buff both and attack much or you have to rebuff since death player only lasts about 30 seconds once your opponent figures out your strategy they'll simply avoid you until your Buffs wear off and you will get frustrated vs Mist will allow you to create pockets they will hesitate to fight in and is excellent if you're outnumbered since enemy players tend to be very aggressive in this case if you absolutely insist on using this weapon in PVE I'd use it with a shield for Block counters or dual wield it with another shot tell for maximum block penetration make sure to use Buffs like Golden Flower flame Grammy strength as well since you'll meet the requirements for them moving along to our non-unique crew of Swords first up is the Scimitar the Scimitar shares the default move set of many crew of swords and Deals physical damage it has a light weight for a curved sword in Elden ring wing 3 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the Scimitar is outclassed by the Bandit's curve Sword falchin and the gross Messer all three of which can be found very early on in Elden ring they all share the same moveset and all three of these weapons have higher attack rating and longer reach they simply weigh a tiny bit more which is easily overlooked if you like the Scimitar but want more damage swap to one of these weapons ASAP the only reasons to use the Scimitar are a he began the game as a warrior and have not yet obtained these weapons B you really need the extra equip load or C you simply cannot be bothered to farm the weapons I just mentioned dual scimitars is the way to go in my opinion if you are going to use them and they are not a bad choice if you want to create an early game bleed build like I did with my bloodblade build but gross master and Bandit's Groove sword is an instant upgrade over them even with the same exact playstyle next up we have the Falcon the Falcon shares the default move set of most curved swords and Deals physical damage it has an average weight for a curved sword and held in ring wing 3.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the Falcon is near the top in terms of attack rating for crew of swords and it's not super hard to obtain dropping from demi-humans and weeping Peninsula and Lim grave it leans more to the strength side of things than dexterity and excels at flame art and sacred infusions with magic pulling up a close second it only slightly outperforms the Scimitar when set to the blood infusion so it's not worth swapping them if you've already upgraded your scimitars as the reach on the Falcon is only very slightly longer consider tool wielding these with a cold infusion for solid damage and Frostbite or go full sacred flame art for Max damage per hit next up is the shamsher the shamsher shares the default moveset of most curved swords and Deals physical damage and has an average weight for a curved sword in Elden ring wing 3.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the Sham sure is in the upper middle pack in terms of overall attack rating for a curved sword but you can only obtain one per play through from high road cave unless someone drops you one and both a gross master and then its curve sword outperform it in terms of damage and reach can also get two of those weapons making them a better choice if you like the curve sword style of play the shamshear has slightly better deck scaling than strength and as with other curved swords makes a great candidate for dual wielding cold is a great option since it has the same damage as Keen but also applies frostbite next up is the gross Messer the gross Messer shares the default moveset of most curve swords and Deals physical damage it has a heavy weight for Groove sword and Elden ringwing 4.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wheel the gross Messer has the second highest attack rating of all curved swords lagging slightly behind the Bandit's Groove sword it weighs a little bit less and is a little bit easier to farm in tomb's word catacombs but it's also slightly shorter than the Bandit's curve sword too for this reason I advise using the bandits curve sword over this one if you can spend the time farming them cold is a great option for these weapons or possibly making one cold in the other fire to create a scenario where you can apply frostbite multiple times in one boss fight blood is also not a bad choice and you'll get nearly 25 damage more than the Scimitar or Falcon with this infusion up next is the Bandit's curve sword the Bandit's curve sword shares the default moveset of most scarf swords and Deals physical damage it is the heaviest curve sword in Elden ring Wang 5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the Bandit's crew of Sword is the attack rating king of curved swords and unless there is a unique curved sword you like more or you're specifically going for a status effect build with a scavenger screw of Sword there isn't any reason to use other curve swords that share the same move set it's also the longest crew of Sword reinforcing this concept however it can take a while to farm from the skeleton near Church of pilgrimage two scavengers occult curve swords will outperform two blood infused Bandits curved swords but you might have to use one if you can't get someone to drop you a second scavengers like I did in my venomous bloodblade build my recommendation if you plan on dual wielding these weapons is to go for Max damage per hit with fire lightning magic or sacred flame art when combined with talismans like Wing sword Insignia Millicent's prosthesis or rotten Wing sword Insignia you'll crank out a ton of damage in a hurry especially if you combine it with spells like flame Grammy strength and golden Val up next is the Chateau The Chateau has a unique R2 shared with the eclipse shot cell and the knox-flowing sword that doesn't hit multiple times and cannot be roll canceled out of but the deals considerably more staggered damage and Deals physical damage it's the lightest curved sword in Elden ring Wang 2 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to will the Chantel is one of the weakest curve swords in Elden ring but it only weighs 2 which is essentially what attacker weighs it can also deal damage through blocks and it's charged R2 can stacker regular enemies in one hit and larger enemies with two which is not common among crew of Swords this is also the case for the Knox flowing sword and a cliff chatel as well you can only obtain one of these weapons in a single playthrough unless someone drops you a second so you'll have to pair it with another crew of Sword if you do a wheel however because it has a fairly strong R2 attack you can also use this weapon with a shield or an A spellblade Build That cast spells since R2 doesn't use the offhand weapon for its damage sacredit or flame art make great choices with this weapon since you usually get about 60 or so damage conversion to Holier fire and enemies don't block 100 of these damage types anyway this will allow even more damage to slip through when they do because of the nature of shot tells the next curve sword we're going to take a look at is the Scavengers curve sword a scavenger's curved sword shares the default moveset of most curve swords and Deals physical damage as an average weight for a curve sword in Ellen ring weighing 3.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to will the scavenger's curve sword is the only curved sword that does bleed build up on hit natively and is naturally a fan favorite for this reason dual crew of Swords work exceptionally well at setting status effects due to their running L1 and jumping L1 attacks outpaced only by twin blades you won't get this one until you get to Mount Gilmore though by setting the scavenger's curve sword to the occult Affinity you still get very solid attack rating as well as bleed build up the downside is that you only get one in a playthrough unless someone drops to another so you'll need to pair it with another curved sword if you want to do a will consider using this one and you're off hand with a band it's a cold curve sword that uses sapuku in your right hand use the Lord of Bloods exultation white mask Millicent's prosthesis and rotten Wing sword Insignia to devastating results up next is the Mantis Blade the Mantis blade has a unique R2 that unfolds the blade extending its range and Deals physical damage it has a heavy weight for a curved sword in Elden ring wing four and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield at first glance it might seem like there is no real reason to use the Mantis blade it has the shortest reach of any curved sword other curved swords have more damage and you can only acquire one of them late into the game in Gilmore Hero's grave however R2 attacks to this weapon have much longer reach and you can stagger enemies easily with charged r2s which most curved swords cannot do except shop tells and shot tells have much lower damage on average this allows you to play one-handed like a shot tell but deal more damage while still having great stagger potential consider pairing this with a shield for a block counter build that focuses on r2s or a seal or staff or a spellblade build that can still stagger on the regular make sure you have a high Poise in order to use block counters and charged r2s more effectively next up is the beastman's curve sword the beastman's curve sword has a unique jumping light and heavy attack incorporating spinning multi-hit attacks and Deals physical damage it has a heavy weight for a curve sword and Elden ring Wang 4 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the beastman's curved sword has excellent strength scaling and is in the upper middle of the pack when it comes to attack rating but is shorter than many other curve swords claim to fame is its unique jumping R1 and R2 attacks that both hit multiple times this allows you to use it one-handed and get better efficacy out of it than some other curved swords though if you're going the rapid hit route which you really should if you're using curved swords it still makes sense to do a wield in my opinion making this function cool but not exactly optimal you cannot get this weapon until the very end of the game and crumbling Ferra Missoula so this is likely to be a new game plus weapon in most cases for this reason I advise using the heavy infusion and placing some points into faith in order to buff it for maximum damage potential this would allow you to use a shield seal and one hand this weapon in the other hand buffing it as necessary then you can make use of the jumping attack when needed but also have access to spells and block counters the next crew of Sword is the flowing curved sword the flowing crew of Sword has a unique multi-hit dancing R2 that consists of a double slash and Deals physical damage it has an average weight for a curved sword and held in ring wing 3.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the flowing curve sword is rather unique because it's R2 and Shard 2 attacks flow together into a sort of rhythmic dance with r2s attacking twice and charged r2s attacking three times this allows you to chain them together assuming you don't get interrupted since you can only get one of these very late in the game and consecrated snow field and because the damage on it isn't that great really the only reason to use this weapon is because of these unique r2s so you want to learn to use them effectively if you're using this weapon determination and Royal Knights resolve make good choices for ashes of War since they will boost this damage even further consider using a shield with this weapon or using it with a seal or staff in order to cast spells as well and lastly we come to the sermon God's curve sword the serpent God's crew of Sword shears the default moveset of most curved swords and Deals physical damage it has a heavy weight for a curved sword and Elden ring Wang 4 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to will the serpent God's curve of Sword is in the middle of the pack when it comes to Total attack rating and reach but the reason to use it is because it heals you whenever you kill something with it equipped in either hand this can come in very handy particularly because you tend to play aggressively when dual wielding curve swords and can allow you to keep attacking without the need to heal each kill heals you for 2.5 percent of your max HP as well as an additional 25 HP having a high figure will make this more effective you can't get this weapon until runes Drew and precipice which is a ways into the game but consider swapping out one of your curve swords for this if you need the healing if healing isn't an issue for you then don't worry about it because this effect doesn't help you in boss fights where nothing dies anyway well that wraps up our video on curved swords what did you guys think of the video what are some tips about curved swords that you guys

Title: Thrusting Swords are the Best Weapon in Elden Ring - Elden Ring All Thrusting Swords Breakdown
Video ID: BD6WPAWgJcU
Transcript Text:
in this Elden ring video I'm going to be showing you why thrusting swords are the best weapon in Elden ring this is the ninth video in a series where we go through all the weapons in a given weapon class and sort of break down their strengths and weaknesses and show you why or why not you might want to use them in your build however before I get into each weapon specifically themselves I want to talk about thrusting swords in general the styles of play available to them and the strengths and weaknesses of this class as a whole many of you have probably caught on by now at the satire of the title of these videos obviously every weapon type cannot be the best weapon in Elden ring this is obviously completely satire based on the amount of clickbait videos out there on the internet however I actually think thrusting swords might be the best weapon in Elden ring based on the factors I'm about to go through first up let's talk about how fast the attack speed of this weapon is it's extremely fast and it's probably one of the only weapon types in the game that can actually get an attack off when you see an enemy wind up an attack a lot of very fast attacking enemies enemies with regular straight swords or regular you know fast attacking weapons are hard to counter-attack them or attack them when you see this wind up you almost always get hit if you try and trade but this is a one weapon class that can usually get an attack off before the enemy a lot of times interrupting them depending on if they have Poise or not thrusting swords themselves have very decent range particularly some of the longer ones and the weapon itself when you press R1 tends to pull you forward and even the running attacks tend to pull you more forward than the weapon would you would think they would pull you so you have very good range with this weapon for the size of it as well allowing you to hit enemies that are relatively far away if you're using the longer versions of this weapon this weapon type also has something called faints where if you're charging up a fully charged R2 attack in order to pull it off but you realize you're going to get hit mid animation you can hit the Dodge button and your character will complete the R2 and jump backwards out of Harm's Way and this is a really good way to protect yourself and makes the sort of duelist style play that the thrusting sword is known for where you're sort of jumping in and out of combat uh and dodging attacks without having to block another interesting thing about this weapon type is the fact that you can attack while you're blocking much like Spears so if you're holding up your shield and you press R1 you'll actually block the incoming attack while you poke with the weapon this typically does less damage than a regular attack however it keeps you safe and if you have something like barricade Shield up and you don't take any stamina damage depending on the shield that you're using then you can attack and block at the same time without draining any extra stamina another thing about this class is that they can Parry thrusting swords can actually Parry this allows you to use a shield but Parry on your thrusting sword allow you to block do block counters and Parry all with one you know setup so this is pretty cool about this class or you can use the weapon to Parry itself doesn't have the best Perry in the game so I don't recommend using it but it is there if you want it another great thing about this weapon class is that the spear Talisman benefits this weapon class because the spear Talisman increases the damage you do with thrusting attacks against an enemy that is attacking you so if an enemy is like in their forward motion of attacking and you hit them like if you're blocking learn you poke them or you're just poking away at them and they're trying to swing at you you do more damage and this will increase the damage that you do with thrusting weapons something particularly interesting about dual wielding with this weapon is that the right hand when you're pressing L1 the second L1 press of the combo will actually hit three times rapidly this means if you have a status effect that you want to apply frequently like bleeding for instance because you can apply this multiple times you're better off putting that in your right hand and something that you can only apply one slight frostbite or poison in your left hand so that you can keep applying that bleed more regularly and you don't you know try to over apply frostbite and you know something like poison as much and another interesting thing is that if you do a jump attack with L1 it does three hits and the follow-up L1 picks up in the middle of the combo so if you jump attack with L1 you get those three hits rapidly and then you poke three times with the right hand so that's interesting and you can use that to your advantage knowing that that's going to happen when figuring out how to play this build or how to play with this weapon type this weapon class also is extremely lightweight meaning that it fits very well into a light whip load sort of build and it's also a good weapon type if you're trying to make good use of the blue dancer charm the cons are that it has relatively low attack damage and some of the shorter reach rapiers have extremely short reach so those can be hard to hit with and also that it does primarily almost exclusively thrusting damage or piercing damage so enemies that are resistant to pierce damage you might struggle with unless you have some sort of Elemental infusion or some sort of status effect that can help you get around that because this weapon has so much versatility there are really almost Limitless styles of play with it you can use a shield with it and hold block and poke through that Shield if you want kind of like a Hop light build but with a Rapier or something like that instead of a spear you can do a Parry build and use either the raid Pure or the Rogers Rapier which both have very good critical attack damage in order to do high critical attacks you can use them to do repeated thrust to hit status effects and dual wielding is also extremely effective and we've shown in our Magus build that using magic with a Rapier is also really good using something like glimp blade failings to stagger enemies and then critically strike them with three pure Rogers Raper works very very well so there are almost Limitless ways you can use this weapon which is another reason I might actually think it is the best weapon type in Illinois okay so without further Ado let's get into the thrusting swords themselves there is only one unique thrusting sword in Elden ring that is the Frozen needle Frozen needle has a unique R2 that fires the tip of the needle into enemies going further and dealing more damage if fully charged and and Deals exclusively physical damage it's the lightest thrusting sword in Elden ring wing 2.5 type of the Rapier and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use although the Frozen needle has low attack rating and very short reach it's surprisingly versatile it takes advantage of the thrusting sword's ability to faint perhaps better than any other thrusting sword because of the range the needle can fly though charged R2 needles are not boosted by the ax Talisman this allows it to hit many enemies safely out of Harm's Way and use a faint should they close the distance before a full charge is performed impaling thrust is also excellent at dealing damage to enemies with shields which is a major weakness of this weapon class the frostbite buildup is a nice addition that can accumulate rather quickly though it only plays a part in more difficult battles since most enemies will die before it ever triggers anyway one particularly good way to trigger frostbite is by dual wielding thrusting swords with the Frozen needle in the right hand the second L2 press Only Hits with this weapon making you build a frostbite much more quickly especially if the left-hand weapon isn't of cold infusion if you use a fire or flame infusion on the left-hand weapon or simply buff it with fire you can set this status effect over and over which is great The Sweet Spot for this weapon is about 50 dexterity from which point it starts dropping off but is still okay through 80 dexterity though the weapon has strength scaling is very poor which makes this a much better first playthrough weapon particularly because you find this weapon so early in King's Realm runes which isn't too far into the game once you've reached 80 dexterity around the end of your first playthrough you won't be able to get much more damage out of the weapon I'd either dual wield this weapon with another Rapier for fast attacks using talismans like Wing sword Insignia rotten Wing sword Insignia Millicent's prosthesis or use it with a pairing Shield of some sort mixing up R2 attacks in Paris or a more Dynamic style of play one particular interesting thing I want to mention about the R2 attack of this weapon is well before I get on to the next weapon is that it doesn't seem to make very much noise so if you're going for some sort of stealth build where you're killing enemies at mid-range with that Frozen needle you can actually pick them off one by one without ever being detected this brings us to the non-unique thrusting swords and first up is the Rapier the Rapier shares the default moveset of most thrusting swords and Deals physical damage it's the lightest stressing sword in Elden ringwing 2.5 tied with a frozen needle and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use the Rapier is pretty unremarkable in nearly every way save one and that is that it's tied for the second highest critical rating of any weapon in the game at 130 outclassed only by the misery cord which is a dagger class weapon this makes it particularly good for Perry's backstabs and on any enemy that has been stamped broken make sure to use the dagger Talisman to further boost critical damage when using this weapon the Rapier otherwise has the second lowest attack rating of all thrusting weapons and has the shortest reach making it a poor choice for just about any other sort of duelist build that focuses on rapid piercing attacks fire and lightning are not too far behind other thrusting swords though neither is Magic making them decent choices if you plan to make a critical attack style build the Rapier is also extremely lightweight which makes it a good candidate for some sort of Bill that uses the blue dancer charm to increase attack power if you like the thrusting sword type weapon but you don't really do many critical attacks then you're better off selecting a different one next up we have the s stock the s-doc shares an R2 with a noble s stock that does a slash instead of a Thrust and Deals physical damage it's the heaviest thrusting sword in the Elden ring wing 4.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use the S stock is a solid thrusting sword in Elden ring pulling up second in the attack rating Department by a small amount being nearly tied for second longest thrusting sword and having an R2 that doesn't deal piercing damage giving you a viable alternative against enemies that resist this damage type on also you can get two in a single playthrough rather easily it does have the heaviest weight though but not by a lot the s stock does less damage on average with critical attacks when compared to the Rapier Rogers Rapier or the clean Rock knight sword so it's better suited for a build that relies on repeated strikes than outright critical attacks because thrusting swords attack so quickly consider using cold blood or poison versions of this weapon to set these status effects fast dual wielding these is also extremely effective just remember that the right hand weapon will hit more than the left hand when do a wielding thrusting swords so it's better for a bleed that can be triggered more than once or frostbite if the left-hand weapon does fire damage since you can set it again and again next is the Noble's ass stock the Noble's ass stock shares an R2 with the s stock that does a slash instead of a Thrust and Deals physical damage it has an average weight for a thrusting sword on element ring Wang 3.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use the noble zest stock is an extremely difficult weapon to acquire and it can take hours to farm one personally I don't think it's worth it either considering the s-doc does more damage and shares the same moveset and is only just shorter if you insist on using this weapon you won't be Min maxing your build and will simply be using it for style which is a 100 acceptable much like other thrusting swords it excels with fire lightning and sacred flame art infusions so those are all good choices for this weapon focus on repeated attack build alone or with another thrusting sword since the Noble's s stock deals the second lowest critical attack damage of any thrusting sword behind the Frozen needle making it a poor choice for critical focused builds next we have the clean rot knight sword the cleaner out knight sword shears the default moveset of most thrusting swords and Deals physical damage it has a heavy weight for a thrusting sword in Elden ring wing four and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use the clean route night sword has the highest attack rating with elemental infusions and has particularly good heavy scaling making it an excellent choice for strength focused build it is also the longest thrusting weapon making it a hard weapon to ignore if you're making a thrusting sword build doesn't have a sweeping R2 attack like the s stock however meaning it can have some difficulty against Pierce resistant enemies if you're not using Elemental infusions or bleed I'd recommend using this weapon with either the fire or heavy infusions to take advantage of its high damage and also use a great shield for solid guard boost while you attack from behind The Shield or do block counters no other thrusting weapon is as effective at this playstyle and additionally you can add the periash of War to the clean rot's night sword so you can block Perry with a great Shield out next we come to Roger's Rapier Rogers Rapier has a unique R2 that hits two times very quickly and Deals physical damage it has an average weight for a thrusting sword in ring wing 3.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield Rogers Rapier is arguably the best all-around thrusting sword in Ellen ring having higher attack rating than most other thrusting swords being in the middle of pack in terms of thrusting sword reach and also having a higher critical attack than all other thrusting swords besides the Rapier itself it also has a unique R2 that hits twice which does less damage than two R1 attacks but fires off much more quickly making it ideal for status effect builds that rely on quick attacks not to mention it comes with one of the best ashes of war in the game and glimp blade Phalanx that can stagger enemies instantly because of the unique R2 and relatively good critical attack I'd advise using this weapon in some sort of duelist build that uses a single thrusting sword while also either pairing or using glimp blade failings for easy stance breaks or use it with a blood infusion or a cultless apuku for massive bleed potential like I did in my Crimson duelist build and lastly we come to the ants for repair the answer Rapier shares the default move set of most thrusting swords and Deals physical damage and has a light weight for a thrusting sword and held ring wing 3 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wheel the ants for rapier's claim to fame is that it's the only weapon an elder ring that can apply Scarlet rot poison and bleed build up all in the same strike if seppuku is used and the poison Affinity is selected it's also one of just a couple Scarlet Rock weapons that can be infused with actions of War making it a great choice for anyone who enjoys applying the status effect Beyond this though the answer Rapier is in the middle of the pack when it comes to overall attack rating and it has the lowest bleed and poison attack rating of all rapiers they'll be trading quite a bit of outright damage for these status effects if you choose to go that route it's also one of the shortest rapiers in Elden ring being only just slightly longer than the Rapier and Frozen needle so there is also that to consider however you could just as easily go something like a cult with seppuku and forego the poison status effect simply making use of scarlet rod on tougher to kill enemies and bosses especially ones that are bleed immune this would give you much higher attack rating and also provide you with a solution to a problem you will face from time to time dual wielding this weapon is another good option since it allows you to strike with it repeatedly if it's in the right hand and also allows you to use a thrusting sword with higher attack rating in the left this can also help you set status effects even faster depending on how your offhand is set make sure to use the Kindred abroads exaltation of Mushroom Crown when using this weapon for even higher attack power assuming you aren't using bleeding on it if so then make sure to add the Lord of blood's exultation and swap out Mushroom Crown for white Mass well that wraps up our video on thrusting swords what do you guys think of this weapon class am I crazier is it actually the best weapon class in the game let us know in the comments below [Music] [Music] thank you

Title: Straight Swords are the Best Weapon in Elden Ring - Elden Ring All Straight Swords Breakdown
Video ID: YPxNRNWlHIU
Transcript Text:
in this eldering video I'm going to be showing you why straight swords are the best weapon in the Elden ring this is the 10th video in our Series where we go through each weapon in a given weapon category and sort of tell you guys the pros and cons of each of those weapons to help you make a better informed decision about whether or not you want to use that weapon in your build I know people have been waiting for this video for quite a while now and it is finally here before we get into the weapons themselves however let's talk a little bit about the pros and cons of this weapon category and the ways I think most people will use straight swords in Elden rank so firstly straight swords have a rather lightweight and Elden ring meaning that it doesn't take a lot of equip load in order to use them they range from about 2.5 to 5.5 which isn't very much weight so there's that they also have very good hit boxes usually slashing like left to right or right to left in sort of a 45 degree angle that'll tend to hit things that are up above you or below you with that attack which is really nice making them hit the hitboxes of enemies a lot more reliably than some other weapon type they also attack a lot faster than a lot of other weapons allowing you to R1 spam a lot of enemies to death without ever getting hit they also have a bit longer reach than some other weapons like axes meses or curved swords allowing them to hit a little bit further additionally quite a few of these weapons have thrust attacks in addition to slashing attacks giving you a different damage type against enemies that might resist one or the other moving along to the cons of straight swords first up is status effects they typically don't support status effect play as well as some other weapon types that's not to say that you can't make a status effect build with straight swords but they don't attack as rapidly as some others and a lot of straight swords most of them the vast majority don't have native status effect buildup on them meaning you're gonna have to add them via ashes of War which typically reduces the damage of a lot of weapons and also the dual wield moveset of straight swords isn't as good as twin blades or curved swords at applying status effects so if you want a status effect buildup you're better off going with one of those two weapon types than you are with straight swords even though you can do it with straight swords if you and lastly they deal a lot less damage than many different weapon types in the game great swords colossal weapons halves Reapers a lot of Spears a lot of twin blades katanas a lot of different weapons deal more damage than straight swords and because they don't excel at status effect buildup it puts them in this weird place in the Middle where they're not good at like jump attack one shot bills or One-Shot builds and they're not good at Stats effect buildup but they're somewhere in the middle so they're kind of like C plus b tier at both of these things when you know a Greatsword is a plus of this type and a curved sword is a plus at status effect buildup talking a bit about the styles of play that most people will use with straight swords most people in my opinion will use straight swords with either a shield or they'll dual wield straight swords and that's because Street Swords just lend themselves very well to a block counter style of build they aren't like I meant as I mentioned ever really gonna one shot too many things with a jump attack sort of build unless you're dual wielding and dual wielding gives you the option to not only do those jump attacks but also do some status effect build up because even though their attacks aren't as good as curved swords or twin blades at setting status effects they're still pretty good and it also allows you to use things like the wing sorted Insignia entailisments like that that build up your attack power with repeated strikes a lot more easily getting their attack power higher and putting them into like a higher class of weapon essentially when that Buffs up so that they're attacking faster than those other weapon classes but they're dealing the same or more damage those things being said let's jump into the unique straight swords first and talk a little bit about those first up is the lazuli Glenstone soar the lazuli Glenstone sword has an R2 that blocks incoming attacks before striking and Deals physical and Magic damage it's a light straight sword in Elden ring Wang 3.5 and requires points in strength dexterity and intelligence in order to use the lazuli Glenstone sword is an interesting weapon because it has rather High attack rating for a straight sword but it doesn't have very long reach and it has an R2 attack that blocks incoming attacks before attacking which is improved by two-handing the weapon or by using the great Shield Talisman however it has terrible protection and guard boost natively making it a strange choice to use for blocking this makes its R2 less useful than other weapons Glenstone pebble is a decent weapon skill that is very inexpensive FP wise and the projectile portion is improved by increasing intelligence and Magic damage but not strength dexterity or physical damage while the follow-up attack seems to be the same ratio of physical magic damage as the weapon itself that is to say depending on how you're set up about 55 magic damage and 45 physical damage and you'll get more damage out of this no matter whether you pump strength dexterity intelligence or increase physical or magic damage The Sweet Spot for this weapon is right around 50 strength and 50 intelligence with both intelligence and strength adding roughly the same amount of damage between about 30 to 50 of each stat despite intelligence having descaling and strength having C however you could take intelligence higher sacrificing some meleely damaging exchange for better sorcery scaling which I advise if you wish to make a spellblade build using this weapon I'd recommend you farm two of these weapons and dual wield them for very high attack raiding with straight swords or you can use them with a great shield for Block counters since you also have a decent amount of strength and most great Shields require strength in order to wield however of the two dual wielding is arguably better since the lazuli Glenstone sword has very short reach making you often miss a lot of your block counter attacks and because it scales decently with both strength and intelligence and dexterity you can use this weapon effectively in NG plus as its damage will continue to improve as you level up albeit at a slower Pace next up is the carrion knight sword the carrion knight sword has an R2 that blocks incoming attacks before striking similar to the lazuli Glenstone sword and Deals physical and Magic damage it has an average weight for a straight sword in Elder ring Wang four and requires some points in strength charity and intelligence in order to use the carrion knight sword outperforms the lazuli Glenstone sword in terms of attack rating but shares the same blocking R2 attack that makes r2s a bit strange and not likely to be used for blocking specifically it also has exceptional attack rating at minimum requirements with a whopping 505 which is a lot for a weapon that weighs 4. however carrion Grandeur its weapon skill does less damage with the same stats than any other cold or magic infused straight sword additionally it does 100 magic damage and doesn't increase with strength or dexterity and what this means is that you lose attack rating to get more carrying grander damage or you lose carrying grander damage to get more attack rating Which is far from ideal and isn't an issue for magic infused straight swords in short if you really like carrion Grandeur I advise using a magic or cold and few straight sword instead of this weapon note that this weapon skill benefits from Godfrey icon so make sure to use it it also is quite expensive at 26 FPS so you may want to use carry and filigree Crest to bring that cost down and make sure to use magic scorpion charm for added damage The Sweet Spot for this weapon is about 50 strength 50 dexterity and 50 intelligence which won't be reached until NG plus making it a great weapon for successive playthroughs and as I mentioned earlier it has very high damage at minimum requirements making it a good choice for low-level players much like the lazuli Glenstone sword you can favor intelligence for more carry and grander damage and sorcery scaling if you go the spellblade route but you lose attack rating this way and you might be better off with the magic infused straight sword with better intelligent scaling if you go this route much like the lazuli Glenstone sword the carrion knight sword works best in a dual wield setup or a block counter build with a great Shield due to its high attack rating and strength scaling but can also be used in a spellblade build though not completely optimal next up is the Crystal Sword the Crystal Sword shares the default move set of most straight swords and Deals physical and Magic damage it's one of the heavier straight swords in Elden ring Wang 4.5 and requires some points in strength dexterity and intelligence in order to use the Crystal Sword has one of the highest attack ratings of unique straight swords that deal magic damage as the best strength scaling of the bunch but is in the middle of the pack when it comes to straight sword length it has a normal R2 attack which I think is an improvement over the lazuli Glenstone sword and carry a knight sword adding another reason to use it its weapon skill spinning slash is not particularly effective especially because the weapon doesn't have the greatest reach but it can work in a pinch if you have high enough Poise The Sweet Spot for this weapon is about 50 strength 50 dexterity and 50 intelligence which won't be reached until NG plus making it a great weapon for successive playthroughs because it has much better strength scaling than intelligence I don't recommend using this in a spellblade build or you will lose more attack rating than you would if you're using the lazuli Glenstone sword or the carrion knight sword in a spellblade type the Crystal Sword works best in a dual wield setup due to its high attack rating and strength scaling just because its length is not that great and spinning slash isn't as effective of a weapon skill making a block counter Shield setup less effective than the previous two weapons this will let you lean into L1 attacks that hit for lots of damage while using another straight sword in your main hand that has a better Ash of War next up is the rotten Crystal Sword the Ron Crystal Sword shares the default moveset of most straight swords and Deals physical and magical damage it's one of the heavier straight swords in Elder ring Wang 4.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity intelligence in order to wheel for all intents and purposes the rotten Crystal Sword operates nearly identically as the crystal soar they have the same appearance except for the color they are the same length they share almost the same exact scaling and weapon skill the only real difference is that the rotten Crystal Sword add Scarlet rot build up to its attacks has slightly lower attack rating and isn't found until the very end of the game because of this you're almost always better off with the crystal sword on regular enemies while using the rotten Crystal Sword on bosses in NG Plus or when cooperating where they have higher Health pools and Scarlet Rock can really put in some work spinning slash is also a better weapon skill in this weapon compared to the Crystal Sword because it allows you to strike rapidly building up Scarlet rot more quickly than if you were just attacking with R1 attacks though not by much in short the rotten Crystal Sword while dealing less damage than the Crystal Sword trades outright damage for scarlet rot this is really only helpful in Boss encounters where enemies live long enough to benefit from this or in PvP where it can pressure players otherwise you're better off going with the Crystal Sword particularly because there are no other straight swords that have Scarlet rot build up on them that you can pair it with next we have the Michelin knight sword the Michelin knight sword has a unique R2 attack that lunges and slashes forward when charged and Deals physical and holy damage it is a light straight sword in Elden ring Wang 3.5 and requires some points in strength dexterity and faith in order to wield the Nikola night sword deals fairly good damage has great reach for a straight sword and has a unique R2 attack that can pull you closer to enemies allowing you to use it more easily while standing outside their attack range you'll also only need 9 more faith in order to be able to use Golden Val which will boost your damage by another 15 percent however it does deal about 30 percent of its damage is Holy which isn't a good damage type in Ellen ring and sacred blade only increases this more sacred blade is a much better weapon skill since patch 1.07 as it's at its speed and range increased the blade can now connect for damage making it great at point-blank range and it now adds 90 holy damage to your attacks instead of 85 and lasts twice as long at 40 seconds however this weapon has terrible fate scaling and the damage of sacred blade is not increased by strength or dexterity only the faith attribute the sacred scorpion charm is not a bad choice to use here as it can boost this weapon's skills damage by a good amount since it's a hundred percent holy damage The Sweet Spot for this weapon is around 50 strength and 50 dexterity as the faith scaling is extremely poor however as I mentioned sacred blade scales with faith which isn't optimal additionally if you want to be able to cast any incantations effectively with the claw Mark seal you'll need to split your stats between strength and Faith which gives you a lower attack rating this forces you to make a tough decision about optimizing between the weapons damage itself or sacred blades damage and incantation scaling I recommend splitting your attributes between strength and faith in order to be able to use incantations and for more sacred blade damage difference between optimal stat spread for the weapon itself and for spell casting is not that much damage and being able to cast incantations will more than make up for this either go for a spellblade type build that uses incantations in sacred blade or grab a great shield and block counter since you'll have high strength using sacred blade for your ranged attacks or combine both into one build that can do it all or go a paladin bill next up is the ornamental straight sword the ornamental straight sword shares the default moveset of most Street swords and Deals physical damage it's a very light straight sword in l-ring Wing 3 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use the ornamental straight sword has some really amazing features even though it's one of the lowest attack power straight swords and even though it doesn't have very long reach it's one of two paired weapons that aren't claws or fists and the R2 attacks hit with both weapons if golden tempering has been used even if you're only one handing the weapon golden tempering was buffed in patch 1.07 to be faster deal more Poise damage and now adds a hundred fully damage instead of 85 fuel weapon attacks and now lasts 60 seconds in short this weapon skill was already strong as we showcased in our golden Champion build but now it's even stronger The Sweet Spot for this weapon is about 50 dexterity but you can take this all the way to 80 dexterity effectively though you aren't going to get much more damage out of it after this point with both strength and dexterity giving about one point of damage per Point invested after this this means the weapon is much better in a first playthrough than it will be NG Plus or Beyond though you can still increase your damage a bit in these playthroughs personally I like to use this weapon with a shield in my off hand this allows you to use a shield in the offhand while you still dealing damage with r2s as if you're dual wielding you can use the jellyfish shield for an additional 20 damage for example additionally your offhand will remain buffed for the duration even if you stop dual wielding allowing them to swap back and forth at will the next straight sword is the golden epitaph the golden Epitaph shares the default moveset of most straight swords and Deals physical and holy damage it's a light straight sword in Elder ringwing 3.5 and requires some points in strength dexterity and faith in order to wield the golden Epitaph is in a strange place because it has high attack rating but it does a fair bit of holy damage which is less than ideal on top of this its weapon skill last right does not stack with golden Val which is a better buff and is obtained earlier than golden Epitaph this makes this weapon really only useful for builds that don't intend to increase their faith to 25 which would likely be few given that you need 14 in order to wield this weapon effectively or when you're facing Undead enemies still the weapon only has slightly less damage than a sacred long sword and has longer reach so if you weren't factoring in Golden Valley the spell it would sort of be a trade-off last rites was buffed in patch 1.07 though increasing its duration to 60 seconds adding 10 damage to your attacks and spells and increasing the damage you deal versus Undead by a whopping 100 percent that's on top of the 25 holy damage it adds to both weapons you're holding this all looks great on paper but the golden Val Ash of War gives you in party members 12.5 damage and 7.5 protection lasts 45 seconds and costs 40 FP the spell gives you in party members 15 damage and 10 protection and lasts 80 seconds but still costs the same 40 FP which means if you can use the spell then there is no reason to use last rights since they don't stack unless you were simply facing Undead enemies The Sweet Spot for this weapon is right around 50 strength 50 dexterity and 50 faith meaning you ideally use this in some sort of build that takes advantage of incantations which should include golden Val and you likely won't reach the optimal stat spread for this weapon until NG plus note that faith has much much better scaling than either dexterity or strength which both have nearly identical scaling in my opinion the best way to use this weapon is in a sword and board setup where you can rebuff your damage easily without having to swap to a sacred seal even if your faith is high enough to use Golden pal or when using a weapon skill in your Shield like barricade Shield since you can swap between two handing and buff and then swap back while retaining to bot just make sure you have enough strength to use a great Shield if you do this you can reach around 1K attack rating this way by the end of the game if you use the jellyfish Shield next is the sword of Saint Trina the sword of Saint Trina shares the default moveset in most straight sores and Deals physical and Magic damage it's a very light straight sword in Elder England 3 and requires some points in strength and dexterity and intelligence in order to use the sword of Saint Trina is near the bottom in terms of unique straight swords attack rating and has very short reach however it does have sleep build up on every hit which can be a game changer in Elder ring as a surprising amount of enemies are affected by it even if they can't be completely put to sleep these enemies usually stagger slightly allowing for extra attacks or backstabs if you're quick Mists of Slumber not only deals damage but it does some sleep build up in a small AOE and adds an additional 70 sleep build up to your attacks for 30 seconds which over doubles your sleep build up per hit this allows you to build up sleep much more easily on hard to kill enemies even if you have to buff with it out of melee range The Sweet Spot for this weapon is about 50 strength and 50 dexterity making it a quality weapon for all intents and purposes as the intelligent scaling is extremely poor for this reason I don't recommend using this weapon in any sort of spellblade build that also uses sorceries since you'll sacrifice melee damage and you don't have much as it is I'd recommend using this in a sword and shield build that focuses on R1 attacks to build up sleep quickly while also doing block counters or in a dual wield setup if you can get two of these such as an NG Plus or if another player drops one next is the regalia of aochan the regalia Veo trade shares the default moveset of most straight swords and Deals physical magic damage it's the heaviest straight sword in Elden ringwang 5.5 and requires some points in strength dexterity and Arcane in order to wield the regalia of AO shade has high attack rating but has a short reach and is the heaviest straight sword in Elden ring however you can get it quite early in Elden ring with a little jumping and it has one of the deadliest weapon skills in the game in AO Jade's dancing blade el-shade's dancing blade not only hits repeatedly allowing you to make excellent use of rotten Wing sword Insignia melison's prosthesis and the thorny cracked here it can also be charged for longer spins allowing it to hit more times and increase its damage via Godfrey icon this allows you to defeat bosses in one or two casts of this ability ability if you can land the whole thing The Sweet Spot for this weapon is about 50 Arcane though 80 Arcane still gives decent damage and dexterity is also not bad once you've reached 50 Arcane allowing this weapon to progress into NG plus and Beyond just fine because you need so much Arcane for this build it makes a great pairing with the dragon communion seal which scales off mostly Arcane and with dragon spells since they don't require many points in faith in order to use like I showcased in my dragon dancer build you could also use this with a shield and just focus on using the weapon's skill when needed since spells are nice but a bit Overkill with this weapon skill in many cases up next is the coded sword the coded sword shares the default move set of most straight swords and Deals holy damage it's the lightest straight sword in Elden ringwang 2.5 and requires some points in faith in order to wield the coded sword might be the most unique straight sword in Elden ring if you don't include the ornamental straight sword it deals 100 holy damage and only scales with the faith attribute making it perfectly suited for Faith casters who will pump this attribute anyways its normal attacks are not repelled by Shields and its weapon skill unblockable blade goes through them unblockable blade was buffed in patch 1.07 and now has a reduced FP cost at 18 and the motion speed and weapon skill itself is much faster allowing for it to be used more often and more easily the ability itself doesn't deal a ton of damage though it's nothing to sneeze at and its medium range allows you to begin swinging before enemies get too close to you the sweet spot for this weapon is around 50 Faith at which point the damage begins to drop off significantly making this a much better weapon for a first play through than NG plus however you don't get it until very late in the game so you won't be able to use it for most of a first playthrough I'd pair this with the urge tree seal for high incantation scaling and decent damage with a straight sword you can even use a shield if you want as long as you have enough strength make sure to use the sacred scorpion seal for increased damage and to use the holy shroud and cracked here often to boost your damage even more since you deal 100 holy damage with your weapon attacks you will get 100 efficacy out of these items and of course the last unique straight sword is the sword of Knight and Flame the sword of Knight and Flame shares the default moveset of most straight swords and Deals physical magic and fire damage it has an average weight for a straight sword in Elton ring wing 4 and requires some points in strength dexterity intelligence and faith in order to wield the sword of Knight and Flame is legendary in Elden ring and for good reason it has the highest attack rating for a straight sword particularly at minimum requirements where it deals 615 damage and its weapon skill Knight and Flame stance is deadly dealing either fire or magic damage depending on what the situation calls for the caveat is that it doesn't scale well with strength or dexterity but rather intelligence and Faith instead making this weapon much more suited to a spell Caster than appear melee Bill Knight in flame stance was nerfed and then rebuffed in patch 1.07 increasing its damage once again the Knight Comet ability allows you to shoot a stream of magic forward giving you a very good range for such a short weapon and the fire sweep ability is excellent at aoing down groups of enemies and those weak to fire damage The Sweet Spot for the sword of nine flame is around 50 intelligence and 50 Faith after which point it barely gains any damage from these attributes however because it's a great pairing with the prince of death staff you'll likely take these stats higher in New Game Plus in order to get the most from this staff I'd pair this weapon with a carrion Regal scepter in my first playthrough prioritizing intelligence once the requirements for the weapon have been met and then swapping to the prince of death staff and new game plus when you have more fate this will allow you to cast spells very well with high sorcery scaling and still use the sword effectively you can also pair it with a shield if you want though your block counters won't be as good as if you're using a great Shield which you won't be able to do because you have very low strength next up let's move to the infusible straight swords the first one is the short sword the short sword's R2 attacks are both thrust unlike most other straight swords and it deals physical damage it's very light straight sword and Elden ring weighing 3 and requires a few points in strength and dexterity in order to will the short sword has the shortest reach of all straight swords it has some of the lowest damage of all straight swords but it does have a few things going for it it's lightweight it has low requirements it can deal thrust damage with r2s and it's easy to acquire however nearly every other straight sword has longer reach and higher attack rating as long as you can spare the extra 0.5 equip load the long sword is already an upgrade the sacred and Flame art infusions are at the top of the list when it comes to Total attack rating for this weapon followed closely by fire and lightning and Magic the weapon also scales better with the Keen infusion when compared to heavy if you insist on using this weapon I recommend using it in a dual wield build that focuses on low equip load trying to make use of the blue dancer charm since this weapon doesn't weigh much you could also cast some incantations if you use the sacred to Flame art affinities which have the most damage and there are sacred seals that weigh zero so they won't add to your flipload up next is the long sword the long sword shares the default moveset of most straight swords and Deals physical damage it's a light straight sword and ring Wang 3.5 and requires a few points in strength and dexterity in order to use the long sword is a direct upgrade in pretty much every way over the short sword for only two more strength and 0.5 equip load you gain 20 to 40 attack rating over every short sword infusion much longer reach and you can still deal thrust damage with your R2 the long sword also has the second highest attack rating of all infusible straight swords being about 10 to 20 points behind the broadsword in nearly every infusion but it is slightly longer iron lightning deal the most damage followed closely by sacred and Flame art with magic pulling up third heavy and Keen deal about the same damage and have about the same scaling so it doesn't matter which of those you choose because both the Lord sworn's straight sword and Noble slender sword deal only slightly less damage both have longer reach and both have higher critical rating they make a better choice for any sort of block counter build which means I'd recommend using this and I do a wheel build or in a spellway build that takes advantage of the high magic and sacred and Flame art scaling next is the broadsword the broadsword's R2 attacks are both slashes unlike most other straight swords and its rolling R1 attack is also a slash and Deals physical damage it has an average weight for a long sword and Ellen ring Wang four and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use the broadsword is the pound-for-pound king when it comes to attack rating for infusible straight swords and is the only infusible straight sword that can hang with the unique straight swords when it comes to damage the downside is that it's shorter than over half the straight swords in Elden ring including the long sword Lord sworn Straight Sword and the noble slender sword it also cannot deal any thrust damage with its R2 attacks making it less versatile in some ways fire and lightning take the top spot when it comes to damage followed by sacred and Flame art magic and heavy pulling up close in the fourth spot with cold not far behind in fit the heavy scaling on this weapon is exceptional and so is cold by extension since it scales with strength as well this puts this weapon in a great spot to use great Shields and still deal excellent damage the downside is that it doesn't have the critical rating of Lord sworn straight sword or the reach but some of this is made up for by the higher attack rating especially if cold is being used to set the status effect next we come to the weathered straight sword the weathered straight sword shares the default move set of most straight swords and Deals physical damage it's very light straight sword and Elm ring wing 3 and require some points in strength and dexterity in order to use the weathered straight sword is essentially a lower attack rating version of the short sword but with slightly longer reach a cool visual appearance and it costs slightly less stamina to swing in short the best reason to use this weapon is the lower stamina consumption particularly if you want to do a will this will allow you to hit more times before draining your stamina bar even though your attacks will deal less damage either go with fire or lightning for Max damage or go with bleeder poison for status effect buildup next up is the Lord sworn straight sword the Lord sworn straight sword shares the default moves out of most straight sores and Deals physical damage it's a light straight sword in L ring Wang 3.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use the Lord sworn straight sword might be the most well-rounded straight sword in own ring it has the third highest attack rating of all infusible straight swords it's in the top half of straight swords when it comes to length it's lighter than most straight swords and is tied for the highest critical rating however if you're not doing critical attacks that often with this weapon there are better straight swords sacred and Flame art are the highest damage with fire and lightning pulling into close second and Magic not too far behind keen and heavy have nearly identical scaling but I don't recommend using heavy since the broadsword has much better heavy scaling because this weapon has high critical attack it makes a good candidate for a block counter build that can take advantage of staggers particularly using the fire infusion that will give you solid strength scaling and allow you to use upgrade Shield another good option is using the magic infusion and some sort of spellblade build that takes advantage of Glenstone failings Ash of war or the great blade failing spell up next is the noble slender sword the noble slender sword shares the default moves out of most straight swords and Deals physical damage it's a light straight sword and own Ringling 3.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use the noble slender sword is the longest straight sword in Ellen ring giving an exceptional reach and it deals more damage than most other infusible straight swords even though it doesn't have the highest attack rating it also has high critical attack allowing you to dispatch staggered enemies effectively however it can take you hours to farm one and I mean hours fire and lightning deal the most damage with this weapon with magic just behind in the second spot in flame art and sacred pulling up third the weapon does much more damage with the Keen infusion when compared to heavy so I recommend using this one if you can't decide between the two because the noble slender sword scales better with Keen than heavy it doesn't lend itself as well to block counter builds because strength is needed for great Shields which make block counters easier to pull off however the fire infusion solves this issue and I recommend using this one if you want to use it for Block counters taking advantage of its length additionally keen and cold are still great options for Perry builds that don't need heavy Shields but still deal regular critical damage the next straight sword is the cane sword the cane sword shares the moveset of the broadsword and Deals physical damage it's the lightest straight sword in Ellen ring wing 2.5 and requires few points in strength and dexterity in order to use the cane sword and ornamental straight sword are the two lowest attack rating straight swords in Elden ring but this one is infusible it has very short reach and it's not found until late into the game making it most likely obsolete by the time you find it the fire and lightning infusions are the best with it and Magic is just behind with sacred and Flame art pulling up third and Keen edging out heavy by about 20 attack rating and much like the weathered straight sword and short sword this weapon lends itself well to a dual wield build that takes advantage of the blue dancer charm lastly we come to the warhawks Talon the warhawks Talon has a unique R2 that swipes two times rapidly and if charged on the second R2 does another two attacks and Deals physical damage it's a light straight sword in Elden ring Wang 3.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the Warhawk Talon has roughly the same attack rating as the noble slender sword at nearly every infusion can take nearly as long to farm but it is a bit shorter and has the spinning slash as its Ash of War instead of square off however its true claim to fame is its unique R2 that slashes twice and if you hold R2 will attack two more times and if you don't hold R2 it will only attack once more because the R2 is really the reason to use this weapon I recommend using it in a build with a shield with a flame art infusion or in a spellblade build that uses sorceries or incantations with the magic or sacred and Flame art infusions make sure to use talismans that reward multiple hits like the winged sword Insignia and Millicent's prosthesis and the ax Talisman for charge to R2 damage that wraps up our straight swords video and I hope I showed you in this video why straight swords are the best weapon in Elden ring we will obviously continue this series until we get through all the weapon classes I'm gonna try and get them a little more frequently than this one I apologize this one took so long but I want to know what your guys thoughts on straight swords are what straight swords do you use how do you play your straight sword let me know in the comments below [Music] [Music] [Music]

Title: Greataxes are the Best Weapon in Elden Ring - Elden Ring All Greataxes Breakdown
Video ID: ywlXqmaDkno
Transcript Text:
in the sound ring video I'm going to be showing you why greataxes are the best weapon in Elden ring this is the 11th video in our Series where we sort of go through all the weapons in a given weapon category go through their pros and cons and sort of give you information to help you decide which ones will be part of your build before we get into that however first let's talk a little bit about the pros and cons of this weapon class as well as the styles of play that I think most players will use when using this weapon group so let's take a look at the pros first the first thing I think you can talk about is that they have insane damage per hit their damage that they do per swing not their total DPS but just on a single hit is very very high and some of the weapons in this group have higher damage than any other great weapon like great swords or great hammers included so very very high damage weapon group secondly they attack fairly fast much faster than you would think allowing them to chain R1 attacks together because enemies typically Flinch when struck by one attack so you can typically get off a full R1 chain uninterrupted with this weapon type additionally 8 out of the 11 weapons in this group are infusible making the vast majority of them the case allowing you to you know switch around ashes of war and really tailor your build to that Ash of war with your weapon and lastly I think greatax is probably more than any of the other weapon groups I've covered so far have a dynamically different way in which each weapon plays that's not to say that they have a drastically different gameplay mechanic or they play drastically differently but that the way they go about accomplishing their strategy even though they might be similar strategies is unique to each one of these weapons talking a little about the cons they are a little bit shorter on average than grade swords who are not going to get quite as much reach depending on which weapon you're using so that can be a bit of a negative additionally some of the more interesting and fusible great axes like The Rusted anchor or butchering knife there is only one of these per play through so unless someone drops you a second one there isn't really any way to dual wield these so talk a little bit about the play Styles I think most people are either going to two hand one great ax they're going to try and dual wield some of the lighter great axes like the great Omen killer Cleaver or the Gargoyles great ax or they're probably going to do some sort of block counter build with a great shield and a great ax and that's because great Shields typically have very high strength requirements most of these weapons do as well so they sort of fit naturally together although there are a couple ways that you can add incantations into playing with one of these weapons it's not as easy to add sorceries in my opinion that's sacrificing a good amount of melee damage so I don't think you're going to see any too many people playing sorceries with these but you might see some people playing like a face style strength Faith Build which is pretty common with one of these weapon types having covered those briefly let's move on to the unique great axes the first up is the gargoyle's black ax the gargoyle's black ax shares the default moveset of most other great axes and Deals physical and holy damage it's one of the lightest great axes known ring wing 8.5 and requires a lot of points in strength and faith and a few in dexterity in order to use the gargoyle's black acts like most other gargoyles black weapons has exceptionally High attack rating particularly at minimum requirements when compared with other weapons in all the ring unfortunately you won't get this weapon until very far into the game in the mountaintops of the Giants meaning you will likely have much higher stats than this when you finally get it the sweet spot for this weapon is around 50 strength and 50 Faith with strength providing more damage up until 50 at which point Faith while performs strength until it hits 50. from here strength Remains the best scaling until 80 where you'll shift to dexterity and then Faith once more this makes this weapon viable in New Game Plus but probably not too much further than that because the guardwell's black ax has relatively good strength and Faith scaling it makes a good weapon to pair with the claw Mark's seal you can use this for Buffs like flame Grammy strength and golden vow or other spells somewhat effectively when buffed with war cry and these two incantations you can reach over 1100 attack rating with no other equipment applied which is very high since the Gargoyles black ax is the shortest great ax in Elden ring you cannot acquire it until far end of the game and because it deals over 50 holy damage which is heavily resistant near the end of the game I don't recommend using this weapon on your first playthrough unless someone can drop you one instead using a new game plus paired with a gargoyles great ax or the climax seal or both and perhaps the old Lord's Talisman to maximize your buff time up next is the winged Great Horn the winged Great Horn shares the default moveset of most other great axes and Deals physical damage it has an average weight for a great ax in Elden ring wing 11 and requires a lot of points in strength and some index dirty in order to use the winged Great Horn is not the king of all great axes and has lower than average length is at the bottom of the pack when it comes to Great ax damage though it does have decent scaling and its weapon skill Soul Stifler is not particularly useful outside of boss fights however this weapon is not to be overlooked Soul Stifler can be used to debuff tough to kill enemies like bosses increasing the damage they receive by 15 for 60 seconds as of patch 1.07 this allows you and your spirit Ash or Cooperators to be more effective in general if you can also apply frostbite you will increase the total damage the target receives by a whopping 35 percent which can be amazing in cooperative play and can make you the star of the show The Sweet Spot for this weapon is at 50 strength and 50 dexterity but it scales extremely well up to 80 in each of these stats reaching over 800 attack rating this makes this weapon phenomenal for New Game Plus and Beyond particularly since Soul Stifler will come in more handy as enemies get tougher to kill I recommend using this weapon with another great ax that is cold infused in order to set the frostbite status effect or if another cooperator is taking care of this for you or if you're using freezing pods for example using it two-handed or with a great Shield since you all have high strength and last up on our list of unique great axes is the acts of godric the acts of godric shares the same R2 attack with a crescent moon ax which has a sweeping attack and a unique follow-up and Deals physical damage it's an average weight great ax in Elder ring Wang 11 and requires a lot of points in strength and dexterity in order to wield the acts of godric is an okay great ax and though it has low damage it still has good reach and you can acquire it relatively early on in the game by defeating godric the grafted but there are some points that make it less useful than it could be it has an amazing R2 attack that can AOE through many enemies at once but because you have an ash of war that does this better and I command the Neil becomes most of the time additionally I command the Neil does not count as three separate strikes but rather one strike so you cannot trigger talismans like winged sword Insignia with it which is a shame The Sweet Spot for this weapon is around 50 strength and 50 dexterity with dexterity slightly outperforming strength from here up to 80 but not by much the weapon still scales well after 50 making it a good choice for New Game Plus and onward I like to two-hand this weapon gaining the extra damage from the strength scaling as well as using jump attacks with a claw Talisman and Raptors black feathers for high burst I use I command the Neal when I need to AOE multiple enemies using Shard of Alexander to boost its damage moving to the non-unique great axis first up is the great ax the great ax shares the default move set of most other great axes and Deals physical damage it is a very heavy grade accidental ring weighing 13 and requires a lot of points in strength and low dexterity in order to wield the great ax is a phenomenal great weapon and has the highest base damage of all great weapons in Elden ring great axes great swords and great hammers it can also be found extremely early on in the carriage pulled by the trolls and Lim grave and though it still has high strength requirements it can be two-handed relatively easily for only 20 strength the downside of this weapon is that it's shorter than nearly every other great ax fire and lightning topped the list in terms of damage at a whopping 810 attack rating followed by Magic and sacred and Flame art heavy is not too far behind here and cold is just behind heavy making it a solid choice if you still want decent strength scaling but also want the frostbite status effect because of its shorter reach I don't recommend using it with a great Shield as it's less likely to connect on block counters if you're pushed back when blocking however you can use it two-handed with jump attacks for great results and also using its charged r2s is very effective if you go the sacred or flame art route you can also buff with Golden Valley on flame Grammy strength while using the claw Mark steel rather effectively up next is the Crescent Moon ax the Crescent Moon ax shares the same R2 attack with the acts of godric which has a sweeping attack and unique follow-up and Deals physical damage it's a very heavy great ax in Elden ring weighing 12.5 and requires a lot of points in strength in some index dirty in order to wheel the Crescent Moon axis claimed to fame is of course its R2 and charged R2 attacks that have wide sweeps which are fantastic for aoing many enemies at once it has the third highest damage of all great axes and it has longer reach than most other great axes and it can be found early in the game by farming enemies in Stormville Castle fire and lightning is just one point behind the great ax in terms of damage but magic and Flame art are more than a dozen points behind and so are most other infusions so I recommend going with fire if you want to keep that high damage to the great ax but like the range and move set a bit more you can two-hand this weapon with a good Ash of War like flaming strike which I used in the Blazing executioner build or you can use it with a great Shield due to your high strength the dexterity requirement makes it less likely to be used in a claw Mark seal build though but it's still possible up next we have the long half ax the long half ax shares the default moveset of most other great axes and Deals physical damage it's a very heavy great accident on ring weighing 12.5 and requires a lot of points in strength and a few index dirty in order to wield the long half ax is slightly longer than the Crescent Moon ax and has slightly more damage in general though lacks the same sweeping R2 attack that the Crescent Moon ax has it can also be found very early in Castle mourn dropping from this begotten Warriors that use this weapon making the decision between these two weapons really up to the slight damage difference in moveset if you don't factor in fashion the long half ax is closer to the damage of the great ax at most infusions than the Crescent Moon ax with fire and lightning being the exception which is the same this makes it a better candidate if you don't want to use the great ax but you want to use other infusions as with the Crescent Moon ax you can two-hand this weapon with a good Ash of War like sword dance or you can use it with a great chill due to your high strength up next is The Executioner's greatax The Executioner's greatax shares the default moveset of most other raid axes and Deals physical damage it's the heaviest great ax in ring Wang 15 and requires a lot of points in strength in a few index theory in order to use The Executioner's great ax is arguably the best all-around great ax and Elden ring it has the longest reach of all great axes it's in the upper middle of the pack in terms of total attack rating and it has 115 critical it's high critical will allow you to devastate stance broken enemies and players and no other great access higher than the default 100 critical rating much like other great access fire and lightning tops to list with magic and Flame art pretty much tied for second and heavy and cold pretty much tied for third cold is always a great option to gain about the same damage you would get from heavy but add the frostbite status effect especially if you're not planning to two-hand the Long Reach of this weapon makes it superb for a block counter build with a great shield and since block countersoff and stagger enemies in one hit you'll make good use of that high critical damage you can even add the dagger Talisman for a more critical up next is the great Omen killer Cleaver the great almond killer Cleaver shares the default moveset of most other great axes and Deals physical damage it has an average weight for a great accident on ring Wang 11 and requires a lot of points in strength and some index dirty in order to wield the great Omen killer Cleaver is a fantastic great ax though it does slightly less damage than most other infusible crate axes however it is the only great ax that has native bleed buildup on hit more than making up for this and it's also one of the longest straight axes in the game the downside is that you cannot find this weapon until much further in the game in volcano Manor and perfumers grotto surprisingly the fire infusion is only 24 points behind the great ax in terms of damage which isn't all that much so I recommend using this infusion if you're planning a straight melee build the great almond killer Cleaver has very low requirements for a great ax making it a bit more versatile it makes a great candidate to dual wield two of these for jump attacks and bleed build up and it can be used with the cloud Mark serial or a great Shield so there are really many ways to use it just swap it out when facing bleed immune enemies for a green ax with higher damage if you can next is the Rusted anchor The Rusted anchor shares the default moveset of most other great axes and Deals physical damage it's a very heavy grade accidental ring weighing 12.5 and requires a lot of points in strength and few and dexterity in order to wheel The Rusted anchor is the unique great ax not only in terms of appearance but also because it deals pierced damage Pierce damage is increased while striking enemies while they're mid their attack animation called counter damage which makes this weapon particularly deadly if you like the R1 spam or jump attack Additionally you can use the spear Talisman to further boost this damage The Rusted anchor is not the longest great ax however and it is in the bottom half of great axes when it comes to length its damage though is just behind the Crescent Moon ax and it can be found in Warren tunnel which is very early on in the game the weapon is best used on an aggressive build that aims to continue attacking through enemy attacks in order to deal counter damage as often as possible so look to stack Poise and do jump attacks with the claw Talisman or R1 attacks and make sure to use the spear towel spin for increased counter damage next we come to the butchering knife the butchering knife has unique R2 attack that is similar to the magma worm scale sword where you grab the blade in both hands and push down and it deals physical damage it is one of the lightest great axes in El ring wing 8.5 and requires some points in strength and several in dexterity in order to wheel the butchering knife doesn't seem all that great at first glance it deals the second lowest damage of all infusible grade axes and you cannot find it until you defeat Anastasia tarnished eater near the Shaded Castle however it's extremely lightweight for great ax it has the lowest strength requirements of great axes it's the second longest great ax and it restores one percent HP per hit with his weapon Keen is actually a viable option for this weapon compared with other great axes simply because of the low strength requirements and because the weapon itself deals much more damage when set to the Keen Affinity versus heavy which isn't the case with most of other great access I'd recommend using this weapon in some sort of fashion that makes best use of Life on hit such as using wild strikes and high Poise to tank hits while you regain HP additionally stacking other HP regain effects such as taker's Cameo or the blessed new Talisman could also help and if you decide to use a shield you could put Holy Ground on it for increased healing or use the icon Shield which has passive HP regeneration as well ricard's great ruin is also an option here as this gives you HP back on kill which will help keep your HP topped up and if you're using the mimic tier it will gain the effects of this passive healing from your equipment which will make it very hard to kill and the last great ax we've come to is the Gargoyles great ax the gargoyle's greatax shares the default moveset of most other read access and Deals physical damage it's one of the lightest great axes of known ring wing 8.5 and requires a lot of points in strength and few index theory in order to wield the gargoyle's greatax deals the lowest damage of all infusible great axes has the second shortest reach and isn't found until you defeat the gargoyle and Altus Plateau which means it'll be some time before you get it additionally it has tremendous heavy scaling but because of its low base damage it is still outperformed by every other Great ACT save the butchering knife when set to the heavy affinity because the great ax outperforms this weapon in terms of damage even when compared against the 99 strength version of this weapon it is recommended you don't use this weapon unless you really need the lower equip weight if you still wish to use this weapon though I'd recommend doing so in a dual grade ax bill that uses this and the gargoyle's black ax since they are both about the same length and they both weigh much less than other grid axes this will allow you to use them without equipment weight issues and do jump attack successfully be sure to set the gargoyle's greatax to Sacred or flame art Affinity that wraps up our video on greataxes and I hope you guys learned something about the weapons in this category there is actually quite a large difference between most of the weapons here and it's a ton of fun to play with each and every one of them stay tuned for more elmering content as we go through some more build guides and some other Elder ring related videos if you guys have a weapon category that you would like to see next please let me know in the comments this will probably shape which video I do next [Music] [Music]

Title: Heavy Thrusting Swords are the Best Weapon in Elden Ring -  All Heavy Thrusting Swords Breakdown
Video ID: Hd5AwvqUpKY
Transcript Text:
in this eldering video I'm going to be showing you why heavy thrusting swords are the greatest weapon in Elden ring this is the 12th video in our Series where we go through every weapon in a given category and sort of show you the pros and cons of those weapons so you can make a decision about whether or not you want to add them to your build before we get into the weapons themselves however first let's talk about the pros and cons of this weapon group as well as the playstyles I think most players will use when using them so first taking a look at the pros of this weapon group usually they have fairly Long Reach meaning that you're going to be able to hit enemies from further away or start your attack from further away allowing you to strike them before they can hit you in many cases and because these weapons deal thrust damage you're going to get extra counter damage when you hit them and they're in middle of attack which is easier to do with this weapon than thrusting swords themselves and this allows you to make good use of the spear Talisman to further increase that counter damage and just like thrusting swords they have the option to do faints meaning that if you go to do a charge to R2 and hit the Dodge button you will Dodge backward and attack in the same animation allowing you to complete your charged r2s early while still getting a strike that doesn't deal as much much damage but then Dodges you out of Harm's Way another really great feature of this weapon group same as thrusting swords is that they can block and attack at the same time which allows you to turtle with like a great Shield or something like that and poke enemies from behind it safely this is really nice because it allows you to deal with enemies that you're not familiar with or moveset without having to risk getting attacked and lastly there are one attack chains are fairly fast allowing you to keep enemies staggered and not being able to attack you most of the time the cons of this weapon group are that they deal almost exclusively thrust damage and if an enemy resists this damage type you're kind of in a world of hurt talking a little bit about the playstyles I think people will use I think there are really three play styles that most people using heavy thrusting historically use and that's first dual wielding heavy thrusting swords using their L1 attack in order to deal very very high damage more than thrusting swords because these weapons are heavier and allowing you to build up attacks you know using like rotten Wing sword Insignia or some sort of talismans like that increasing your attack power just dealing more and more damage as you attack over and over another option is to use one of these with a shield in order to have sort of like a block counter build that allows you to poke from behind the shield without taking damage and that's very very effective with this weapon as well and then lastly probably just using a single heavy thrusting sword leaning into the ash of war the weapon for instance if you're using something like the Gods Stitcher you could use sapuku to trigger bleeding with your R2 attacks or if you're using something like bloody hellis you're going to use L2 in order to dodge out of the way with dinos finesse and then follow up with our two attacks not really needing anything else in that build and the same is true for Dragon King's Crag blade as well this weapon has a fantastic weapon skill that kind of allows you to just abuse it moving along to the weapons themselves let's start with the two non-infusable heavy thrusting swords first and the first one is the bloody hellis the body helis shares the same moveset as Dragon King's Crag blade and has a wider arc on the backward sweep faint attack and Deals physical damage it's the heaviest heavy thrusting sword in Elden ring wing 8 and requires some points in strength dexterity and Arcane in order to use the bloody hellis has the lowest attack rating of all Heavy thrusting swords but it is the longest of the bunch it has an exceptional weapon skill in dinos finesse that allows you to spin through enemy attacks via iframes and follow up with devastating r2s that are affected by Warrior jar Shard and Shard of Alexander it also has very high native bleed buildup on hit allowing you to rip off huge chunks of HP while also buffing yourself with things like white mask or Lord of blood's exultation dynast finesse provides you a means to dodge much more effectively than rolling and is unaffected by equip weight allowing you to stack armor to the moon and not have to worry about fat rolling however it consumes more stamina than a normal roll and you'll need a huge investment in endurance in order to be able to use dinos finesse at will so when using this weapon do not skip placing points into this attribute additionally the green turtle Talisman and Viridian Amber Medallion can also help with stamina management The Sweet Spot for this weapon is around 50 Arcane 30 dexterity and minimum strength it scales very well with both dexterity and Arcane from this point forward though making it particularly good for Angie plus and Beyond and you'd be wise to take both of these to 80 before placing points into strength since the bloody hellis has fantastic Arcane scaling the dragon communion seal is a viable pairing if you wish to sling some spells too the issue here is that unless you dedicate some points to faith you'll have a very limited selection since most incantations require in order to cast this means you would be limited to blood or Dragon incantation simply because you won't have the needed attribute points to meet the requirements for this weapon pump Arcane and pump Faith however if you decide to play Journey 2 or 3 with this weapon you'll be able to accomplish this much more easily I recommend focusing on the use of dinos finesse when using this weapon as I did in my bloody ballerina build stacking stamina so that you can use it whenever you want in slotting Lord of blood's exultation and Shard of Alexander for increased damage Focus Arcane and endurance for best results moving along we have the dragon King's Crag Blade the dragon King's Crag blade shares the same moveset as the bloody hellis and Deals physical and lightning damage it is the heaviest heavy thrusting sword in El ring wing 8 and requires some points in strength and a lot of points in dexterity in order to use the dragon King's Crag blade has the highest damage of all Heavy thrusting swords doesn't weigh much and has the second longest reach of all Heavy thrusting swords losing to the bloody hellis by a small margin however it does have split damage between physical and lightning making it less effective in some cases its weapon skill Thundercloud form hits like a truck and can be used from a modest Distance by holding down L2 this is not a Charged attack however and is therefore not boosted by Godfrey icon though Shard of Alexander and Warrior jar Shard do affect it you can actually navigate while moving through the air while holding L2 though allowing you to change directions and maneuver around obstacles this allows you to cast it safely behind cover and move into an enemy that you don't have line of sight on The Sweet Spot for this weapon is at its minimum strength requirement and about 50 dexterity it scales well all the way up to 80 decks from this point forward you'll increase strength which scales okay to 50 but not well after this point this allows you to use this weapon in NG plus effectively but you may have difficulty in the second half of NG plus plus and I don't recommend going further than this with this weapon because the dragon King's Crag blade is primarily a dexterity weapon and cannot be buffed it doesn't lend itself well to hybrid builds that spellcast instead you should focus on the strength of this weapon which are its weapon skill the fact that you can block and attack simultaneously if you have a shield and it deals relatively high damage for its weight this will allow you to block effectively as well as block counter well with a slight investment into strength to get a great Shield like icon Shield or another with low strength requirement use the curve sword Talisman to boost your block counter damage and consider using carry and filigree Crest and assassin Cerulean dagger to help manage your FP due to Thundercloud form's high cost moving along to the infusible heavy thrusting swords first we have the great ape the grid APA has an R2 that slashes allowing you to hit multiple enemies more easily or mobile targets and Deals physical damage it's the lightest heavy thrusting sword in the ring wing 6.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use the great ape is the go-to option for those wishing to use a heavy thrusting sword from the very beginning of the game but it is the shortest one it deals similar damage to the godskin stitcher even if it is slightly less with most infusions but it has a different R2 attack that can be useful for cleaving through multiple enemies or hitting fast moving targets then thrust attacks are likely to miss you'll have the highest attack rating with the fire or lightning infusions followed closely by sacred and Flame art and then finally magic heavy outperforms Keen but only by a small amount making either option perfectly viable and cold is somewhere in between them as another good option because fire heavy and cold are good options I highly recommend going the strength route and using this weapon with a great chill for Block counters as well as turtleing behind the shield while attacking you can use a nasty combo of block counter followed by a quick L2 if you're using the impaling thrust Ash of War to stagger almost anything leaving you open for a critical attack you Shard of Alexander curve sword Talisman dagger Talisman and ritual sword Talisman to boost your damage when set up this way and the last heavy thrusting sword is of course the godskin stitcher the godskin stitcher has a Charged R2 that thrusts twice not unlike Rogers Rapier and Deals physical damage it's one of the lightest having thrusting swords in Elm ringwing 7 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to will the godskin stitcher has the second highest attack rating of all Heavy thrusting swords but loses out to the great AP if you're going the heavy route and is slightly longer it's a great choice to apply status effects because of its charge R2 attack that hits twice rapidly particularly bleed since this can be applied multiple times per fight easily fire and lightning are the highest attack rating with sacred and Flay Mark coming in second in Magic a close third Keane actually outperforms heavy with this weapon though not by a huge amount and cold is another viable option if you want the status effect the blood infusion puts you at 519 attack rating which is about 65 lower attack rating than the bloody hellis so you're gonna have to decide if you want lower attack rating but freedom to pick a different Ash of war or if you want the higher damage and locked into the dinos finesse weapon skill I recommend going the blood route and using something like seppuku to further increase your bleed build up with your charge star 2 attacks playing similarly to the way I played my Crimson duelist build however note that you must fully charge the R2 to get two strikes which makes it a bit more challenging to pull off also you don't always need to charge R2 so don't get carried away trying to always trigger this sometimes an R1 chain or R2 followed up by an R1 is more than enough and usually after a Charged R2 you can follow with another regular R2 to trigger hemorrhage use talismans like Lord of blood's exultation rotten Wings sword Insignia Millicent's prosthesis and the ax Talisman to boost your attack power higher and use the white mask if you want further damage make sure you have high points you can trade hits with spamming charge R2 attacks that wraps up our video on heavy thrusting swords there were only four in this one but I hope it gives you some information that can help you make a better judgment about which one you want to use in your build and how to use it effectively stay tuned for more Elder ring builds and content throughout this week and next although we will have some more Hogwarts Legacy videos sprinkled in there as well so you can look forward to those if you have a particular weapon

Title: Colossal Swords are the Best Weapon in Elden Ring - Elden Ring All Colossal Swords Breakdown

Transcript Text:
in this Ellen ring video I'm going to be showing you why colossal swords are the best weapon in Elden ring this is the 13th video in our Series where we go through each weapon in a given weapon category sort of dissect its pros and cons and show you why you may or may not want to use it in your build before we get into each weapon however first let's talk about the pros and cons of this weapon type as well as the playstyles I think most people will use when using it first let's talk a little bit about the pros of this weapon group I think the first one is quite obvious that they deal incredible damage per swing some of the highest damage in the game in a single hit and they tend to make enemies Flinch very easily when you strike them with this because of how heavy and impactful these weapons are so it's very hard for an enemy to attack you if you're just R1 spamming into them secondly these weapons tend to give you very good Poise meaning that even if you don't meet the 51 armor threshold for most attacks to be able to tank a hit you generally can tank through hits anyway when attacking with this weapon if you get a ways into the animation so it doesn't really matter as much what armor you're using although it's still good to wear protective armor and armor with good pulleys you generally don't have a problem getting swings off even if your armor employees are not you know as high as they could be in other builds additionally there are a lot of unique weapon skills in this category that are only available on these weapons 6 of the 11 colossal swords have very unique weapon skills that you will not find on other weapons and lastly this weapon type has exceptional guard boost meaning you can actually use these weapons to block very very well allowing you to do block counters with them and also just block in a pinch so you don't take full damage talking a bit about the cons of this weapon group first is the weight these weapons have an extremely high weight making them difficult to use in a lot of builds that don't focus on a lot of endurance and still medium roll most builds want to be able to at least medium roll this means that you're not going to have very good protection early on in the game if you're trying to use one until you've gotten your endurance very high and because these weapons also typically have very high strength requirements you almost have to put points exclusively into strength and endurance in order to be able to play this weapon and that doesn't afford a lot of points for Vigor either so there is a bit of a struggle early on in the game to put a build together to use one of these weapons something that's rectified later on in the game when you have more attribute points additionally they do tend to attack slower than some other weapon types so they're not as easy to get off against very fast and aggressive enemies talking about play Styles available to this weapon type I think the vast majority of people are just going to use a single colossal sword and its weapon skill and that's because of the weight of these and the fact that they deal very very high damage and very few of them scale well with like faith and intelligence making like a spellblade build with this less likely and because they have such high strength requirements you'd have to put a lot of points in strength to be able to one hand it while you're still having a staff in the other hand to cast spells or a seal and that means that you would have to split your stats between like strength and intelligence or strength and faith and while you could make a strength Faith one more easily because of the claw Mark seal strength intelligence would be a lot more difficult to do with this weapon group so I think the vast majority of people are just going to two-hand one of these and go to town with the R1 attacks jump attacks are two attacks and the weapon skill available to that weapon so jumping into the unique colossal swords first up is the troll knight sword the troll knight sword shares a unique R2 thrust with this y-hander and Deals physical and Magic damage it has an average weight for a colossal sword in Elden ring wing 18 and requires some points in strength and dexterity and intelligence in order to wield the troll knight sword deals relatively okay damage for a colossal sword and can be found relatively early on in carry a manner but is also one of the shortest colossal swords and its weapon skill trolls Roar doesn't take advantage of its magic damage with a shout portion which makes up about one-third of the damage the weapon does this means trolls Roar would be more effective on a purely physical damage weapon like the giant Crusher or Greatsword the upside though is that the shout deals strike damage while the weapon itself deals standard and Pierce giving you another damage type that's good against enemies weak to strike like the crystalline enemies having three damage Types on one weapon because of its R2 thrust allows the troll knight sword to be effective in just about any scenario additionally trolls war was also buffed in patch 1.07 to increase its damage as well as the timing of its Poise making it easier to pull off uninterrupted the weapon scale is about the same with strength and dexterity so you'll want to keep these values roughly the same up to 50 at which point intelligence will perform about the same up to 50 and then you can tank strength and dexterity to 80. this makes this weapon good for a first playthrough and also fine in New Game Plus because the weapon skills poorly with intelligence it doesn't lend itself well to a spellblade sort of build and I'd highly recommend leaning into the weapon skill for staggering enemies and following up with critical attacks you can use the roar Medallion to further boost shout damage and the follow-up attack damage and the Highland ax does the same thing so I recommend holding this in your off hand if you slot the Assassin's Cerulean and Crimson daggers with this as well you can heal and refund FP with each critical attack similar to my colossal Crusher build but less effective since colossal swords don't trigger these talismans twice the way colossal weapons do the ax Talisman is also not a bad choice since the charged r2s of this weapon have phenomenal range next up we have the Royal Greatsword the Royal Greatsword shares the default attack of most colossal swords and Deals physical and Magic damage it has a heavy weight for a colossal sword in Elden ring wing 20 and requires some points in strength dexterity and intelligence in order to wield the Royal grade sword has a very high attack rating for Unique colossal sword and is fairly long compared to other colossal swords its weapon skill Wolf's assault can be devastating and is not particularly hard to pull off often one-shotting most enemies and often nearly killing difficult enemies in one strike the downside is that you cannot get this weapon until very far into the game by doing Randy's questline Wolf's assault's initial strike can be challenging to land in a frantic fight with anything that's quick moving but its follow-up AOE almost never misses this AOE also builds up frostbite though this almost never triggers and really shouldn't be factored too much into this build additionally this weapon does both physical and Magic damage which also applies to Wolf's assault though the majority of this damage is Magic the real Greatsword scales the best with intelligence then strength and finely dexterity The Sweet Spot for this weapon is about 50 intelligence and 50 strength with minimum dexterity this means using this weapon with a staff in your off hand for some spell casting isn't a bad idea though if you two hand this weapon with an optimal stat spread you'll all have nearly 1K attack rating meaning spells won't really be necessary most of the time I recommend either two-handing this weapon leading into its weapon skill for difficult and packs of enemies as well as bosses or pairing it with a staff and cast some spells before you charge in the melee range Terra Magica is also a great spell for this weapon since it does about 60 magic damage and don't forget to use the magic shroud and cracked here as well to further increase this up next we have the Grafton blade grade sword the Grafton blade Greatsword shares the default attack of most colossal swords and Deals physical damage it has a very heavy weight for a colossal sword in L ring wing 21 and requires a lot of points in strength and some index theory in order to use the grafted blade grade sword has fairly High attack rating and can be found very early in the game in weaving Peninsula making it a decent choice for players wanting to use a colossal sword early on however it's a rather short compared to other colossal swords and its weapons skill oath of Vengeance which increases all of your attributes by 5 for 60 seconds is not particularly useful unless you're playing some sort of hybrid build but you cannot buff the grafted blade Greatsword with spells making it a bad pairing for this for all intents and purposes you'd be better off picking up the great sword since it has higher damage length and can be outfitted with numerous ashes of wars and buff however if you wish to use this weapon The Sweet Spot is about 50 strength with minimal points in dexterity though it scales very well up to 80 strength dexterity doesn't have the best scaling but you would invest here after strength to increase damage likely in New Game Plus I recommend using this weapon two-handed buffing with oath of Vengeance regularly to increase your stats by 5 and using flame grant me strength and golden valve for boss fights or you need a bit more damage since oath of Vengeance can save you some points in faith next we come to the runes Greatsword the rune's Greatsword has a Charged R2 attack that sends out a small wave of gravity energy that deals damage separately from the R2 and Deals physical and Magic damage it's tied for the heaviest colossal sword in Elden ring wing 23 and requires a lot of points and strength and summoned intelligence in order to wield the rune's Greatsword has a lot going for it it has very high attack rating for a unique colossal sword it can be found not terribly far into the game and red main castle and it has a solid weapon skill and wave of Destruction and it is very high guard boost for a weapon and decent resistances making it a defensive tool as well however it is the second shortest colossal sword and it has almost no intelligent scaling making it a poor choice for any spellblade wave of Destruction might not hit as hard as many other weapons skills but it does stagger enemies giving you the opportunity to spam this without taking damage for this reason using the ritual sword Talisman might not be a bad idea if you find you're not getting hit often in order to further boost this damage The Sweet Spot for this weapon is 50 strength and minimum intelligence but the weapon scales very well until 80 strength and you should be aiming for about that by the end of your first playthrough since you barely get any damage from intelligence or strength from this point onward this weapon will not perform as well in New Game Plus and will fare even worse on a third playthrough the best way to use this weapon is two-handed leaning into the wave of Destruction and boosting this with shroud of Alexander and reducing its cost with carrion filigree Crest and sacrificial ax in your off hand keep your mind stat somewhat high in the 25 to 30 range to get more uses of this before you need to use an FP flask and be sure to block with it often utilizing block counters when you want to conserve FP you can add the taker's Cameo Talisman or assassins Crimson dagger to offset the chip damage you'll receive when blocking the ax Talisman while boosting the damage of your Charizard 2 attacks does not increase the damage of the gravity spikes that come out with it so just keep that in mind before using this one moving along to the star Scourge grade sword the starscourage Greatsword is actually a paired weapon that cannot be two-handed the way other colossal swords can be and Deals physical and Magic damage and has an average weight for a colossal sword and ring wing 20 and requires a lot of points in strength in some in dexterity intelligence in order to use the starskirts Greatsword is a truly unique weapon because it's one of only two paired weapons in album ring that aren't claws or fists this allows you to dual wield these rather easily since colossal swords typically weigh too much to dual wield unless you are set up perfectly Additionally the weapon has decent attack rating and it deals an extra 30 damage to gravity type enemies it's weapon skill star caller cry has tremendous range often when shotting trash with its shout and the follow-up attack will finish off nearly everything else that isn't a boss star color cry is not only buffed by shot of Alexander but also wore a medallion and Highland acts as well though only the shout portion is affected and not the follow-up attack however the shout portion will trigger talismans like rotten Wing sword Insignia and Millicent's prosthesis boosting the damage of the follow-up attack significantly if you can hit multiple enemies with a shout the downside is that it is very expensive FP wise to use making it hard to use frequently The Sweet Spot for this weapon is right around 50 strength and minimum requirements and dexterity and intelligence however dexterity and strength both scale about the same from this point onward so you should prioritize those with int having really bad scaling this weapon can work well in NG plus because it scales well enough up to 80 strength and 50 dexterity but you will struggle to get damage afterwards making a third playthrough more challenging because the intelligent scaling is so poor and because this weapon is a unique paired weapon I highly recommend dual wielding the swords and taking advantage of star color cry and jump attacks it's simply way more difficult to dual wield any other colossal swords making it almost a must way to play with thieves just be sure to use the sacrificial ax in your off hand for more FP gain next is the godslayer's Greatsword the god slayer's Greatsword shares the default attack of most colossal swords and Deals physical and fire damage and has a light weight for a colossal sword and Elm ring wing 17.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity and faith in order to wield God slayer's Greatsword is an interesting weapon because it deals physical and fire damage it's very lightweight for a fossil sword and it's one of the longer colossal swords however it's just above the troll knight sword in terms of damage meaning it has the second lowest damage of all unique colossal swords and you have to defeat a rather difficult boss in order to obtain it its weapon skill the Queen's black flame does solid damage though and inflicts the black flame status with its strike sapping HP from the target over time it has a rather long wind up making the timing bit crucial and this gives the weapon skill a bit of a learning curve it also makes Poise important so that you can swing uninterrupted since you typically get hit while trading with this weapon The Sweet Spot for this weapon is about 50 dexterity and minimum requirements in both strength and Faith however if you two-hand this weapon you get roughly the same damage out of pumping strength as you do from dexterity making it a better option if you wish to cast incantations with the claw Mark seal while using this weapon you can get quite a bit of damage from this weapon via all three stats making it a great choice for a second or third playthrough because you can two-hand this weapon with decent strength and faith and get nearly the same damage as if you pump dexterity I highly recommend you go this route and cast some incantations with the claw Mark seal however if you don't wish to do this then simply pump dexterity and make sure to get Faith 25 for Golden Val to further boost your damage when facing bosses or tough enemies while two handing the rest of the time flame grant me strength is also amazing in this build so make sure you have it slotted too next up is malachette's Black Blade which is the last unique colossal sword malacca's blackblade shares the default attack of most colossal swords and Deals physical and holy damage it has a heavy weight for a colossal sword known ring wing 22 and requires a lot of points in strength and summon faith and dexterity in order to use malacast blackblade has high attack rating for a colossal sword it's one of the longer colossal swords in the game it looks badass and it has an excellent weapon skill in Destin death but about one third of its damage is Holy which is resisted by a lot of bosses and you cannot get this weapon until nearly the end of the game this puts it in an odd place Destin death deals modest damage but removes 10 Max HP of any Target struck by it and this can stack with blade of death or the Black Blade incantation but not both for this reason it's highly recommend that you use one of these with this weapon in order to remove 20 hp from a boss rather quickly of the two Black Blade makes more sense since you don't need much dexterity for this build the sweet spot for this weapon is at 50 strength and minimum requirements in both dexterity and Faith but Faith scales fairly well up to 50 and strength scales fairly well up to 80 making this a solid weapon for a second or even third playthrough because you can pump strength and faith and get nearly the same damage you get from pumping strength I highly recommend doing so and slotting at least the Golden Valley and Black Blade incantations and using the claw Mark seal you can of course add other incantations but these two minimally should be used of all the unique colossal swords malachath Black Blade makes the best case for a hybrid sort of build and this takes us to our non-unique colossal swords first up is this y-hander the zwehander shares a unique R2 thrust with a troll knight sword and Deals physical damage it's the lightest colossal sword in Elder ring weighing 15.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use the zwanda has the lowest attack rating of all colossal swords but it's also the lightest has the second longest reach and has the lowest requirements needing only 13 strength to two hands in addition it has a thrusting R2 attack that has great range and it can be found extremely early on in Elton ring in the weaving peninsula the fire infusion deals the most damage followed by Magic and then sacred and Flame art pulling up a close third heavy and cold are roughly the same damage so it comes down to a choice of the status effect or whether you want to use Buffs on your blade if you go those routes the zway hunter makes a great choice for early game colossal sword users since they can procure it and wield it almost immediately it's also lighter than a lot of colossal swords allowing you to medium roll with less investment and endurance stamp uppercut is also a fantastic weapon skill that works well throughout the game and you can purchase this from The warmaster Shack if you want to change infusions but still keep the weapon skill don't forget to use the ax Talisman as well to boost your charged R2 poke damage up next we have the Greatsword which is actually a colossal sword the Greatsword has a unique slashing R2 and Deals physical damage it's tied for the heaviest colossal sword in El ring wing 23 and requires a lot of points and strength and some index 30 in order to use the great sword is the pound-for-pound king of infusible colossal swords it wins an attack rating in nearly every category over other infusible colossal swords it's also the longest colossal sword and has the highest guard boost and protection and you can acquire it with a two minute horse ride over to Caleb without killing a single enemy the downside is that it's extremely heavy making it a bit harder to wield early on and still medium roll just like this y-hander the fire infusion deals the most damage followed closely by Magic and then sacred and Flame art heavy and cold are roughly the same damage so it comes down to a choice of the status effect or whether or not you want to buff your blade heavy or cold are great choices for this weapon early on where the extra strength scaling from two-handing can play a large role increasing your damage and using the curved sword talispin will increase your block counter damage which you should be doing now and then with this weapon you can also use the great Shield Talisman to increase your guard boost with this Weapon by 10 percent giving around 73 guard boost if you use the standard version of this weapon up next we have the Watchdogs Greatsword the watchdog's great sword shares the default attack of most colossal swords and Deals physical damage and has a very heavy weight for a colossal swordnell ring wing 22 and requires a lot of points in strength and some dexterity in order to use the watchtog's Greatsword deals fantastic damage only just behind the great sword however it isn't as long as the Greatsword has lower guard boost can take forever to farm and cannot be found until near the end of the game making it likely that by the time you get one by some miracle you likely won't need it the fire infusion deals the most damage fought closely by Magic and then sacred and Flame art heavy and cold again are roughly the same so it comes down to which you want to choose either having the frostbite status effect or being able to buff your blade I recommend using the great sword instead of this weapon and saving yourself the frustration of farming it especially since it's not better than the grave sword anyway and you'll likely have your Greatsword upgraded to Max upgrade or near Max by the time you get it however if you do want to use this I suggest using it in a similar manner to the Greatsword and lastly we come to the trolls golden sword the trolls golden sword shares the default attack of most colossal swords and Deals physical damage and has an average weight for a colossal sword in Elden ring wing 19 and requires a lot of points and strength and some index theory in order to use the trolls golden sword has lower damage than the majority of colossal swords it's one of the shorter ones and it's not found until Altus Plateau making it likely that you already have a colossal sword and upgraded it by the time you even get one however it does seem to do more damage with trolls Roar than other colossal swords even though it has lower attack rating making it a good choice if you really like this weapon skill much like the other infusible colossal swords fire does the most damage followed by Magic and sacred and Flame art pulling up third and heavy and cold are about the same I highly recommend leaning into trolls War if you use this weapon and use it to stagger enemies often use Shard of Alexander and War Medallion to further boost damage with Highland ax in your offhand as well the Assassin's talismans are also good addition since you tend to get a lot of critical attacks when playing with this weapon skill so that wraps up our video on colossal swords I hope it was helpful hope you guys learned something let me know what weapon you guys want to see next I have no idea which one I'm going to do so give me your suggestions on that we have low long Fallen Dynasty just around the corner so you guys can expect to see some guides and builds on that not too far down the road but we will still be mixing in element content as well so stay tuned for more build guides and weapon videos [Music] [Music] thank you

Title: Curved Greatswords are the Best Weapon in Elden Ring - Elden Ring All Curved Greatswords Breakdown
Video ID: diSCHOrqe4U
Transcript Text:
in the sound ring video I'm going to be showing you why curved great swords are the best weapon in Elden ring this is our 14th video showcasing all the weapons within a certain weapon group showcasing their strengths and weaknesses so that you can decide if they should be a part of your build or not before I get into that however first let's take a look at the pros and cons of this weapon group itself as well as the styles of play that I think most people will use while playing one of these weapons taking a look at the pros first curve swords have a decent amount of reach compared to other weapon types and they attack a bit faster than some of the other heavy weapon groups additionally three of the nine curved grade swords will be able to set status effects natively and five of the nine have unique weapon skills that are available only to them some of the cons of this weapon group are that their block counters hit in a shorter distance than a lot of other weapon types and that many of the best ones in this weapon group are not found until very late into the game when it comes to the playstyles I think most people use when using curved grade swords I think they'll either two hand a single great curved sword in order to lean into its weapon skill and get fast attacks with R1 or they'll do a wield curve grade swords in order to use jump attack Max will probably falling back on one of the weapon skills I don't think you're going to see too many hybrid builds with this weapon group meaning you're not going to see like a strength Faith Build very frequently or a strength intelligence or dexterity Faith dexterity intelligence there just aren't too many weapons that lend themselves well to that in my opinion unless you're doing something like the Hellfire Herald build but you're using two infusible curve great swords otherwise probably gonna stick with you know strength dexterity from most of these weapons or the stats that they scale natively with leaning into their weapon skill but you probably won't add too many spells unless they're just Buffs to that those things being said let's jump into the unique curve great source First beginning with a bloodhound's Fang the Bloodhound Spang shares the default attack of most curved greatswords and Deals physical damage it has an average weight for a curve sword and ring wing 11.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use the Bloodhound Spang is an absolute Banger of a curved grade sword it's one of two curved grade swords with Native Leaf buildup on hit it has increased jump attack damage he's the third longest per of grade sword it can still be buffed with magic or grease and you can acquire it within the first 10 minutes of the game by defeating Bloodhound Knight darewell there are almost no negatives to this weapon Bloodhounds finesse is a great weapon skill as well providing you a means to quickly get away from a difficult enemy or boss and then darting back in if you want to follow up with another slash both of these animations have some iframes associated with them so you can learn the timing to outright negate damage while you'll deal it The Sweet Spot for this weapon is about 45 strength and 55 dexterity though the weapon has phenomenal scaling for dexterity all the way up to 80 and strength is not bad either which you prioritize after this point though depends on whether or not you're two ending the weapon or single handing it strengthening the better option if you're too handing because the weapon scales so well up to 80 in both of these stats the weapon will still perform well in NG plus and NG plus plus I strongly recommend making a build with this weapon like my Bloodhound build that leans into the weapon skill as well as jump attacks which are two of the three strongest aspects of the weapon don't prioritize bleed as it's not something you will trigger often due to the high damage of the weapon itself but do remember to use grease and boss fights for increased damage or bleed build up when needed the Raptors black feathers work well here further boosting your jump attack damage as does the cloth Talisman I'd also include Warrior jar Shard or Shard of Alexander to boost Bloodhounds finesse damage and the green turtle talispin and or the green turtle Shield even if it's just on your back to boost stamina recovery because bloodhound's finesse is a stamina monster up next is the Onyx Lord's Greatsword the Onyx Lord's grave sword shares the default attack of most great swords and Deals physical and Magic damage and has an average weight for a curved Greatsword in l-ring Wing 11.5 and requires some points in strike dexterity and some intelligence in order to use the Onyx Lord's great sword is an interesting curve sword because it has relatively good damage of which some is Magic making it the only curved Greatsword with Native intelligence scaling it's got an average reach and it deals increased damage to gravity-based enemies like Alabaster Lawrence however you cannot find it until further on in the game in the sealed tunnel in the capital outskirts its weapon skill Onyx Lord's repulsion knocks enemies backward off and off their feet and the sword itself does additional damage if you can strike an enemy with it when using this weapon's skill the AOE does 100 magic damage which is a touch problematic as the sword itself scales much better with strength and intelligence despite both having B scaling and Max upgrade still it hits many enemies at once at medium range and it hits them for relatively good damage as well it can also strike through objects allowing you to stay out of Harm's Way The Sweet Spot for this weapon is about 50 strength and 30 intelligence with minimum points invested into dexterity strength outscales intelligence from this point onward up to about 80 but intelligence does well until 50 where it'll drop off sharply however because onic Lord's propulsion scales with intelligence only and not strength I recommend prioritizing intelligence to about 40 or so once you have enough strength to build the weapon this will allow you to get the most from this weapon skill while only sacrificing a small amount of melee damage to do it build wise I suggest two-handing this weapon taking advantage of its solid strength scaling and leading into its weapon skill when needed block counters are not particularly effective with this weapon as it has short range so I don't recommend using a shield with this weapon use Shard of Alexander or Warrior jar Shard and Magic scorpion charm for increased repulsion damage and make sure to use carry and filigree Crest and the sacrificial ax in your offhand to help with FP management make sure you have over 51 POI so that you can tank through some hits while using this weapon skill as it has a long windup up next we have this more curve sort there's a more curve sword has a unique R1 chain that spins the character between each strike and increases its damage multiplier even more so than other curved great swords and Deals physical damage it has an average weight for a curved grade sword and on ring wing 9 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use there's a more curved sword is a bit of a strange weapon because it has very low attack rating and is the shortest curved great sword in Elden ring however it is one of the lightest curved grade swords and it's the only one that does frostbite build up natively and it does more damage per R1 hit after the first strike than other curved grade swords maxing out at 1.2 times the damage on the fourth swing versus the 1.1 times the damage of other curved grade swords on the fourth swing this last bit though is less important since the lower base damage means you'll essentially come out the same as other curve great swords damage wise but only if you complete your R1 chain this also makes it a good candidate for the twin blade Talisman that boosts the damage of your final R1 Chain Swing it's just too bad you cannot acquire it until near the end of the game and giant conquering Heroes great where this weapon really shines though is its weapon skills a more ice storm it operates in a similar manner to Onyx Lord's repulsion only it doesn't knock enemies away or down does frostbite build up with each hit and hits repeatedly instead of in one blast note that these repeated hits only count as one combined attack so it does not trigger talismans like rotten Wing sword Insignia Etc even if it hits multiple enemies like Onyx Lord's repulsion it also deals 100 magic damage which is strange considering the weapon deals no magic damage and either strength nor dexterity boosts the damage of this weapon skill or your jar Shard or Shard of Alexander magic scorpion charm and Magic shrouded cracked here all boost the damage of this skill significantly and it deals about twice the damage of anikalor's repulsion with each cast costing 12 FPS less and as I mentioned inflix frostbite build up with each hit note that its attack power and Frostbite status buildup has been increased its casting speed has been increased and its recovery time has been shortened as a patch 1.07 The Sweet Spot for this weapon is about 45 strength and 55 dexterity though the weapon skills okay up to 80 with both of these stats making it an okay choice for NG plus however since there is no way to increase the damage of some more ice storm via scaling you'll have a hard time on a third playthrough as it takes more and more casts to wipe out your enemies I recommend two-handing this weapon and leading into its weapon skill spamming it as much as needed to set frostbite on top enemies and to wipe out groups when outnumbered or using it in a dual wield setup with something like bloodhound's Fang for bleed build as well using either weapon skill depending on the boss you are facing next we have magma worm scale sword the magma worm scale sword shares a unique R2 attack with the omen Cleaver and Deals physical and fire damage it has a very heavy weight for a curved grade sword in ring wing 15 and requires some points in strength dexterity and faith in order to wield magma worm scale sword has incredibly High attack rating for curve grade sword and can be acquired not terribly far into the game if you know where to go in the Rune stream precipice especially compared to some other curved grade swords it is extremely heavy though and it's in the bottom half of curved grade swords when it comes to length but its weapon skill magma Guillotine more than makes up for it magma Guillotine can often one or two shot bosses with its initial attack and follow-up and it's damn near impossible to interrupt once it's far enough into its animation making it one of the deadliest weapon skills in Elden ring once you use this weapon skill it's pretty much easy mode from there on out this weapon skill does use a ton of stamina though making it hard to use it back to back unless you've got good endurance or the right gear so plan accordingly The Sweet Spot for this weapon is about 55 strength and 50 Faith with minimum points in dexterity but it scales rather well up to 80 strength and 50 dexterity as well making it a weapon that performs well in New Game Plus and Beyond I recommend making something like my Drake night build with this weapon leaning into its weapon skill as it's really the best thing about this weapon use flame grant me strength and golden vow to buff before boss fights for increased damage and use Shard of Alexander over your jar Shard and fire scorpion charm to further boost your magma gear team damage and then we come to the last unique curved grade sword margot's curious sword margot's curse sword shares the default attack of most curb crate swords and Deals physical damage it is the lightest curved grade sword and known ring wing 7.5 and requires some points in strength and Arcane and a lot of points of dexterity in order to use while margot's curse sword has markedly lower attack rating than most other curved grade swords it has a lot going for it it's the lightest and longest Groove great sword and has natively build up on it does improve with Arcane scaling and it has the highest critical multiplier of all curved grade swords at 110. unfortunately it cannot be acquired until after you beat Margot which is approaching the end of the game-ish Chris blood sliced its weapon skill actually adds fire damage to its attacks and the trailing slice deals 100 fire damage so you can get some fire damage out of this weapon this makes flame grant me strength a really great buff for this weapon skill since it will buff all aspects of its damage Chris bloodslice also deals fantastic damage if you land the whole combo which can sometimes be difficult to do on bosses unless you have good Poise however it's quite expensive at 20 FP and 20 more for the follow-up meaning you cannot use it regularly without planning for it I recommend using the carrion filgrid Crest if you use this since it'll reduce the FP cost of the initial attack and follow-up by a total of 10 FP which is nothing to sneeze at The Sweet Spot for this weapon is about 50 dexterity and 50 Arcane with dexterity outperforming Arcane in terms of damage but Arcane adding bleed build up which you prioritize really depends on whether or not you plan to use the dragon communion seal or to Casa incantations if you do plan on using it you might want to prioritize Arcane after meeting the initial dexterity requirements if not focusing on dexterity for more damage should probably be the play here because of the Native Arcane scaling morgot's curse sword makes a great candidate for Dragon communion seal pairing and a small assortment of incantations like flame Grammy strength golden Val and either Madness and Blood Spells like I did in my Mad King build or Dragon spills since these have lower Faith requirements however you could just as easily play this with only the weapon maxing its weapon damage if you plan to go the hybrid route focus on Arcane meeting the minimum dexterity requirement of 35 and add enough Faith to cast the incantations you want add things like the fire scorpion charm and ritual sword Talisman which boosts the damage of fire incantations and crisp blood slice as well as your overall damage of full health note that the roar Medallion now affects Dragon spells so make sure you slot it if you use those if you plan to go pure melee you'll want Shard of Alexander over your jar Shard carrion filigree Crest and possibly even ancestral Spirit horn and sacrificial ax to increase your cursed blood slice damage while also reducing its cost and providing a means to get FP back with kills make sure you have good mind with this setup as well so that wraps up our unique curved great swords which brings us to our infusible ones beginning with dismounter the dismounter shares the default attack of most curb grade swords and Deals physical damage has an average weight for a curved sword in El ring wing 10 and requires some points in strengthened exterior in order to use the dismounter is the second longest curved grade sword it has decent attack rating it's rather light at 10 weight and can be found very early on in Ellen ring by farming the Caden Warriors who wield it however it is outperformed damage Wise by The Omen Cleaver which isn't much harder to acquire making the choice between these weapons really between the length of the weapon the weight of the weapon with the omen Cleaver being 2.5 heavier and the different R2 attacks as they both have the same exact strength and Dexter requirements however unlike the omen Cleaver magic is the leading damage infusion here followed by sacred and Flame art and then fire and lighting just behind that Keen actually outperforms heavy so you might want to consider this option if you plan to one-hand the weapon with the shield I don't recommend magic or sacred and flea Mart even though they have the highest damage since you need to invest several points into strengthen dexterity to use this weapon which won't leave you with as many points for fate for intelligence early on if you decide to use this over the omen Cleaver either lean into a strong Ash of war or one-hand it with a shield I'm not a fan of block counters with curb great swords but this one is one of the longest and it makes the best case for it if you insist on a block counter focus build with a curved grade sword next we have the omen Cleaver The Omen Cleaver shares a unique R2 attack with a magma worm scale sword and Deals physical damage has an average weight for a curb grade sword in El ring wing 11.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use the omen Cleaver is the king of early game curved grade swords since it's longer than most crew of great source has higher attack rating than all but the beastman's Cleaver and can be formed in Stormville Castle from The Omen enemy there rather easily if you like curve great swords but don't know where to begin this is a great option as it will be hard to beat later on unless you want a specific weapon skill the R2 attack of this weapon has very short range but it can be executed extremely quickly allowing you to spam it at point-blank range easily fire and lightning come in first place for damage than magic with sacred and playmark just behind that heavy and Keener after these with cold just behind those the relatively low requirements for this weapon and its average weight make it possible to play this two-handed or too dual wielded pair of them utilizing jump attacks I strongly suggest using the heavier cold infusions if you're not going for fire or lightning and two handing this weapon with a strong Ash of War like sword dance it often one shots most enemies on the first hit and if not the second hit surely does meaning you really need to use the follow-up attack next is the Monk's flame Blade the Monk's flameblade shares the default attack of most corrupt great swords and Deals physical damage and has an average weight for a curb grade sword in l-ring Wing 9 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use amongst flameblade has the lowest attack rating of all infusible curve grade swords it's the third shortest curb grade sword and you cannot find it until near the end of the game in giant conquering Hero's Grave by farming the fire monks there which can take a while this makes the only real reason to use this weapon is because of its cosmetic appearance which is in my opinion one of the best in the game fire and lightning takes the top spot for damage followed by Magic with flame art and sacred being a close third Keen outperforms heavy with cold being just behind that consider using this weapon with a cold infusion and a dual wield setup with something like the bloodhound's Fang in order to rip off huge chunks of Health between frostbite and Hemorrhage though you likely will already have a suitable replacement with dismounter much earlier on in the game and this brings us to our last curve grade sword the beastman's cleaver the beastman's cleaver shares the default attack of most great swords and Deals physical damage it is the heaviest curb grade sword inel ring wing 16.5 and requires a lot of points in strength and in some index theory in order to use the beastman's cura sword is the king of curved great swords when it comes to damage and it has exceptional guard boost as well making it great for blocking and block counters while two handing it you can also get one relatively early on in the game by taking the lowest way gate on the hill of the four belfries and learning of the Lakes however it is also the heaviest crew of graysword and has the second shortest reach so you'll have to consider these things as well fire and lightning take the top spot here with magic a distance second and sacred and Flame aren't coming in third heavy is Miles Ahead of keen in terms of damage which is also coincidentally outperformed by cold as well making it a decent option because this is primarily a strength based weapon and one that blocks well two-handed I suggest using it in this manner particularly because it's so heavy and using jump attacks are twos block counters and a solid Ash of War like wild strikes or sword dance to take out enemies in any manner that is fitting if you don't like the length of the weapon or it's too heavy Omen Cleaver is a solid second option so that wraps up our curved greatswords video I hope you guys learned something if you have any more questions please leave them in the comments or if I missed something leave them there for other players so that they can get that information let me know in the comments what uh weapon group you guys want me to do next since I'm not sure which one to go at and I think also we are going to have another build guide on Friday so stay tuned for that [Music] [Music] thank you

Title: Spears are the Best Weapon in Elden Ring - Elden Ring All Spears Breakdown
Video ID: sVYxZ11-_fA
Transcript Text:
in this Alden ring video I'm going to be showing you why Spears are the best weapon in Elden ring this is our 15th video showcasing all the weapons within a particular weapon group and showing you their strengths and weaknesses to help you better decide which one should be a part of your build before we get into that however first let's talk about the pros and cons of this weapon group along with the styles of play that I think most players will use when using these weapon types so let's take a look at the pros of this weapon group first I think is the most obvious which is the length of these weapons Spears are some of the longest weapons in Elden ring allowing you to hit targets from a good distance away while you're staying safe another big Pro this weapon is that they're able to do counter damage rather easily counter damage in Elden ring is where you deal thrust damage to an enemy that is mid their attack animation this is not the wind-up of their attack animation this is actually the forward attack animation so this is a very small window but you need to deal thrust damage during that animation in order to gain increased damage to enemies and since fears have predominantly thrust damage they are the de facto weapon type that's good at this because of their range as well and this is why these fear tell is actually named after them and this Talisman increases the amount of counter damage that you deal when you deal thrust damage to an enemy that is amid that an animation another really big perk of this weapon group is that you can actually hold block and attack with your Shield up not unlike the heavy thrusting swords or thrusting swords so you can actually protect yourself and attack at the same time and last but not least I would say that their dual wield attack animation is extremely fast and in some cases it even feels like it's faster than regular R1 attacks moving along to the cons the first is that they deal almost exclusively thrust damage this is kind of a double-edged sword while it allows you to get that counter damage more easily it also makes you in a situation where if enemies are resistant to thrust you don't have a lot of options to get around that so having almost exclusively thrust damage can be bad for this weapon type as well and another point piggybacking off this as well is because spheres tend to thrust forward in a straight line they don't sweep or slash through their attacks they have smaller hitboxes than a lot of weapons that can catch enemies that move at the last second whereas this weapon type has trouble with that and also a lot of enemies have like concave body shapes or if you lock onto their torso you're attacking at the furthest possible distance instead of something closer like the leg or the arm allowing you to miss a lot of times while you're attacking moving along to the styles of play that I think most people will use when using Spears I think there's basically two styles of play available to most players there are exceptions to this but I think generally you're either going to use a shield and a spear using some sort of block counter setup or some sort of Hop light build where you Turtle behind your shield and poke enemies or you're going to dual wield Spears and really lean into that fast attack of two Spears at the same time Spears generally don't have the highest damage of most weapons in this game so getting that dual wield setup will allow you to kill enemies a lot more quickly that's not to say that you cannot make a hybrid build with these weapon types it's just that I feel like most people will lean into those two styles of play now that we've got those things out of the way let's get into the unique Spears first first up is the torch pull the torch poll shares the default attack of most spheres and Deals physical and fire damage and has an average weight for a spironel ring weighing six and requires some points in strength and some index steering in order to use the torch ball has abysmal damage but it does have a couple things going for it it can be acquired early on in stormvale Castle by farming enemies there that wield it and it's the third longest Spear and it generates light and dark places that allows you to see more easily its weapon skill charge fourth is not unique and performs okay as far as weapon skills go as you can often get it off without problems however it does have a long windup and doesn't perform that well against bosses The Sweet Spot for this weapon is right about 50 strength and 50 dexterity with a sharp drop off from this point forward when combined with the fact that the fire damage on this weapon does not scale whatsoever you will likely not be able to use this weapon beyond your first playthrough easily as you won't get hardly any more damage out of it because this weapon has such poor damage I highly recommend dual wielding it with another Spear of about the same length like the pike or cross naganata make sure to equip the spear Talisman when set up this way and also things like Millicent's prosthesis or rotten Wings sword Insignia to further boost your damage or if you don't want to play that way using a great shield with it and block countering because the torch pull is so long and because you can boost block counter damage with curved sword talispin and follow-up criticals with dagger Talisman while countering with this weapon deals much higher damage than regular attacks additionally adding some faith in order to use flame grantly strength and golden valve can go a long way towards boosting damage so I highly recommend doing so if you really want to use this weapon next up is the inquisitor's jirindol the inquisitors jirindol shares the default attack of most spirits and Deals physical and fire damage and has a heavy weight for a spear nail and ring wing 7.5 and requires some points in strength dexterity and faith in order to use The Inquisitor is durandal is a pretty solid spear it's one of three Spears that has natively built up on hint you can get it somewhat early on in the game if you get grabbed at the bottom of rail lucaria Academy and it deals pretty good damage for a spear the downside is that it's rather short for a sphere and even though you can acquire it somewhat early on you might have difficulty doing so since the boss you must defeat is not an easy fight for a local character its weapon skill charge fourth is okay and is definitely situational but you may have trouble using it against bosses that have high Poise The Sweet Spot for this weapon is 50 Faith 50 strength and 50 dexterity though you likely won't get there in one playthrough making this an ideal weapon for New Game Plus and even though this weapon does have B scaling and Faith it only moderately outperforms strength and dexterity so where you put your points with this weapon is really up to how you want to play it the inquisitors durangle does scale well up to 80 Faith though so make sure you do this after all of these are up to 50. there are really two ways you can play this weapon effectively and that's either block countering with some incantations not unlike my lightning Lancer build or by dual wielding it with something like the spike sphere to get increased damage on attack and to give yourself the best possible chance to trigger Hemorrhage on enemies and bosses if your block countering use a great shield for the best possible guard boost and hardness and split your stats between faith and strength with minimum dexterity use the claw Mark seal for Buffs of any offensive incantations you like ideally Fire based use the curved sword Talisman spear Talisman fire scorpion charm and something like the ritual sword Talisman to maximize your overall damage if you're going to do a wield you can put the inquisitor's durangle in your left hand if you want to use a different Ash of War on Spike spear since it's infusible but charge fourth is not terrible split your stats evenly between strength and dexterity with 25 points in faith for Golden Val and Flame Grammy strength so that you can use these against more challenging enemies use millisen's prosthesis and win sword Insignia as well as fear Talisman for increased damage since these weapons attack quickly without one consider adding white mask and Lord of blood's exultation for boss fights for increased attack power during these situations as well next up we have the crystal spear the crystal sphere shares the default attack of most spheres and Deals physical and Magic damage it has an average weight for a spironellin ring weighing 5.5 and requires some points in strength dexterity and intelligence in order to wheel of all the weapons I've covered in my Elden Ring videos this might be the first weapon that I cannot find anything good or anything bad about the crystal spear has average length average damage it can be found somewhat early but not really early in the game in short the crystal spear is a solid sphere that won't let you down nor will it blow your mind impaling thrust though is a solid weapon skill and arguably underrated by most players out there the damage of it is not insane but it has great reach with the spear weapon type and it has excellent stance damage making it incredibly easy to stagger enemies and get critical strikes and since this weapon skill only costs 9f P if you have the Assassin Cerulean dagger equipped you can use it nearly infinitely think of it as a more cost efficient transient Moonlight but with less overall stance damage The Sweet Spot for this weapon is that minimum strength and intelligence and 50 dexterity but it scales well up to 80 dexterity which should be your first goal once there you can pump strength with just decent scaling up to 50 despite its d-rating but from that point onward you won't get much out of this weapon intelligence does not scale well at all so this weapon does not make a good candidate for a spell spear either pair the spear with another deck scaling spear for a dual-willed style of play or use something like to carry a Knight shield and shield and spirit of the two Styles I prefer to chill and spear simply because impaling thrust is exceptional and you won't need the extra weapon if you're using it often which you should if you're using the crystal spear charged R2 and paling thrust R2 is a nasty combo against tougher enemies if you do decide to Shield a spear use scholar shield and great Shield Talisman to further improve your guard boost of carry a Knight shield and make sure to slot where your jar Shard or Shard of Alexander and assassin Cerulean dagger for better impaling thrust performance next up is the rotten Crystal sphere the rotten Crystal spear shares the default attack of most Spears and Deals physical and Magic damage it has an average weight for a spear nail ring Wang 5.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity and intelligence in order to wield the four major differences between the rotten Crystal Spear and Crystal spear are one that it does scarlet rot build up on hit two it does about five percent less damage per hit three it has a different weapon skill and charge fourth and four you won't find it until damn near the very end of the game in the hallowed tree area making them more of an NG plus weapon the stat requirements weight and length of these weapons are the same as is the manner in which they scale so you should definitely focus on dexterity if you're using this weapon keeping minimum requirements and strength and intelligence however I'd play these weapons differently while I'm partial to sword and spear with the standard crystal version of this weapon I like dual wielding this weapon ideally with two rotten Crystal Spears if possible this is because Charge 4 frankly is not as good as impaling thrust so you simply won't use it as much and because it's much easier to set Scarlet rot when you can hit with two sources of it at the same time much like other dual-willed spear setups Wing sword Insignia and Millicent's prosthesis are good for boosting attack power and in this case mushroom Helm and congrat of Rock's exaltation are good for boss fights next we have the clean Rod spear the clean Rod sphere shares an R2 attack with a short spear that thrusts twice rapidly and Deals physical and holy damage it has an average weight for a spironel ring wing 5.5 and requires some points in strength dexterity and faith in order to wheel the clean Rod sphere has decent damage and has an excellent R2 attack that helps trigger talismans like winged sword Insignia and Millicent's prosthesis it boosts the immunity stat which helps you better resist poison and Scarlet rot and it can be acquired fairly early on from farming clean rot nights in caled however it does some holy damage and many bosses resist this damage type particularly end game bosses its weapon skill sacred Phalanx does decent damage but has a rather long windup making it tricky to use without getting hit Additionally the actual Spears that come out of the ground you'll 100 holy damage which makes things interesting this allows you to boost the damage of these Spears easily with sacred scorpion charm and holy shroud and cracked here as well as Warrior jar Shard or shot of Alexander but again holy damage is resisted by many difficult bosses making this problematic in key areas of the game The Sweet Spot for this weapon is at 50 strength and 50 dexterity with minimum points into faith faith scales poorly with this weapon so I recommend only taking it up to 25 to pick up Golden foul and some other Buffs the weapon doesn't scale well otherwise which makes it less viable with each playthrough past NG plus since the R2 attack of this weapon hits twice which is good for triggering Wing sword Insignia Etc and you have decent strength I recommend one-handing this weapon with a great shield for Block counters allowing it to use R2 when you can and also use sacred Phalanx when needed make sure you slot assassins railing dagger to help offset some of your FP costs for going foul and other Buffs as well as your weapon skill next is the death ritual spear the death ritual spear has a slashing R2 shared with a partisan and spiked Spear and Deals physical and Magic damage and has an average weight for a severe nail and ring wing 6.5 and requires some points in strength dexterity and intelligence in order to wield the death ritual spear is easily one of the best Spears in Elven ring it has high attack rating it has the highest critical rating of all Spears making it great for Block counters and it has a slashing R2 that allows you to deal a different damage type rather than thrusting should the need arise this R2 is also great for hitting enemies that are more mobile or harder to hit with rust attacks the downside is that you cannot find this until near the end of the game in mountaintops on the Giants spear call ritual is one of the best weapon skills in the game dealing 100 magic damage in a large AOE that hits enemies over and over and often hits larger targets even more times due to the nature of the AOE you can absolutely melt bosses and tough to kill enemies if you can get the drop on them often before they can even get an attack off The Sweet Spot for this weapon is that 50 dexterity with minimum points in strength and intelligence however it scales up to 80 dexterity quite well and 50 strength and 50 in are not bad this makes this an excellent weapon for NG plus and Beyond however spear call ritual gains a lot of damage from intelligence and I mean a lot so you must choose between more melee damage with decks and more spear call ritual damage with intelligence early on you can really play this spear two ways you can either lean into the intelligence and make some sort of spell spear build like I did in my silent spear collar or you can go the Dex route and sword important utilizing block counters and taking advantage of the 110 critical rating on this weapon either way make sure you use Warrior jar shark or shot of Alexander and Magic scorpion charm to further boost your spare call ritual damage and this brings us to our last unique spear the bolt of grand sax the bolt of grand sacks shares the default attack of most spheres and Deals physical and lightning damage the heaviest spear in El ring wing 8.5 and requires some points in strength and a lot of dexterity in order to use the bolt of grand sax is considered one of the legendary armaments for a reason and not only has the highest attack rating of all unique Spears it's the second longest sphere and Deals increased damage to dragons and ancient dragons which is much needed since these enemy types usually resist lightning however it is the heaviest Spear and you cannot find it until the Landell Royal Capital Area and you can miss it if you progress the game too far before picking it up ancient Lightning Spear is one of the most deadly weapon skills in Elden ring firing a lightning spear over extremely long distance that deals 100 lightning damage this makes it easy to boost with lightning scorpion charm and lightning shredded cracked here besides the usual Warrior jarshard or shot of Alexander and because it's chargeable which increases its damage you can also add Godfrey icon to further boost the damage when you charge it allowing for some insane numbers The Sweet Spot for this weapon is about 50 dexterity with minimum points and strength but the weapon scales very well up to 80 dexterity and 50 strength keep in mind that only dexterity increases the lightning damage of this weapon as well as the lightning damage of ancient Lightning Spear however it's not by a terribly large amount so make sure that you have enough strength to use a great Shield if you want because ancient Lightning Spear is so deadly and you need 20 strength anyway for the requirements for this weapon I highly advise using some sort of block counter build that tosses ancient lightning Spears as necessary to pick off-ranged enemies or tough to kill enemies at range if you use the Assassin's thrilling dagger you can refund 15 FP every time you critical after a block counter helping to refund the cost of your ancient lightning Spears and making your life easier next we come to the infusible spears first up the short spear the short spear shares an R2 attack with a clean Rod spear that thrusts twice rapidly and Deals physical damage it is the lightest spirion ring wing 4 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use while the short spear does have extremely low attack rating and it's the second shortest spear it's also the lightest can be acquired from the Twin Maiden husks and Round Table hold and it has an R2 that attacks twice making it good for a status effect builds particularly since the nerfing of dual wield status effect buildup the magic infusion leads the pack and damage here with sacred and Flame art and fire and lightning not too far behind and has slightly more damage with Keen than heavy making the choice between the two rather mood I personally liked play this weapon with the blood infusion and seppuku mimicking a similar build as my Crimson duelist leaning into the R2 attacks that hit twice and using block counters that deal much more damage than regular attacks use white mask for the blood's exultation Millicent's prosthesis and Wing sword insignia for best results next is the iron spear the iron spear shares the default attack of most Spears and Deals physical damage and has a light weight for a spironell ring wank 4.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity and refuse the iron spear is tied with the short spear for shortest and Elden ring it has a very low attack rating and you cannot find it until necron internal City meaning you would likely have a better spear than it by the time you got one anyway magic and sacred and Flame art are tied for Max attack rating with Byron lighting coming in second and heavy a distance third heavy barely outperforms Keen so it's not super important which you choose if you insist on playing this weapon either dual wield it with another spear to further boost attack damage using talismans like Wing sword Insignia and Millicent's prosthesis or use it with a great shield and use block counter styles of play in order to be a bit defensive impaling rust is a great Ash of War to choose for this and if you use assassin's really dagger you can refund its cost and then some with each use next is the spear the spear shares the default attack of most Spears and Deals physical damage and has a lightweight for a spironol ring Wang 4.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use the best thing about the spear is that it can be acquired rather early in Stormville Castle from farming enemies but otherwise it's the second shortest Spear and it barely outperforms the iron Spear and short spear for attack rating when it comes to damaged fire and lightning take the top spot with sacred and Flame art and Magic essentially tied for second key now performs heavy by about 20 attack rating so consider going the Keen route if you don't like any of the other infusions I like to pair this weapon with another spear in dual wield for increased damage per hit due to L1 attacks again use talismans like Wing sword Insignia and melson's prosthesis as well as spear Talisman and high Poise you can trade damage and you don't have to stop thrusting up next is the partisan the partisan has a slashing R2 shared with a spike Spear and death ritual Spear and Deals physical damage it has an average weight for spironol ring weing 6.5 5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use the partisan is one of the better performing infusible Spears with the highest base damage of all infusible Spears and it can be acquired pretty quickly from the knight in Fort Gale located in waving Peninsula it is however outperformed by the spike spear in nearly every way so if you like this weapon consider using the spike spear instead sacred and Flame art are virtually tied with magic for the top infusion with fire and lightning pulling up a close second and heavy being a distant third the weapon has higher attack rating with heavy than Keen by about 17 points at this level which makes it a slightly better strength weapon than dexterity I recommend using this weapon with a great shield and block countering due to the better strength scaling but you could dual wield it as well if you want since the strength damage is not that much more than decks up next is the pike the pike has a unique upwards thrusting R2 and Deals physical damage it has a heavy weight for a spironol ring wing 7.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use the Pike's claim to fame is that it's longer than all other superiors and I don't mean by a little bit it's very long this makes it a great weapon to hit enemies without taking damage since you don't need to get too close its attack rating is in the middle of the pack and it's a bit heavy for a spear but you can find it very early on in Stormville Castle also its unique R2 attack is very situational sacred flame art and Magic are essentially tied for the first spot with fire and lightning coming in a close second and heavy a distant third heavy outperforms Keen by 35 attack rating at this level so it's primarily going to be a strength weapon I like to play this weapon with a great shield for Block counters because of its natural inclination for strength and because it has such long reach using something like repeating thrust on this weapon also works very well since you can begin its wind up from such a long range I like to set the blood affinity and lean into this ash of War using block counters as necessary much like a dual-willed setup talismans like Wing sword Insignia Millicent's prosthesis help here as does Lord of blood's exultation if you go the blood round since you'll be hitting rapidly up next is the spiked spear the spiked spear has a slashing R2 shared with a partisan and death ritual sphere and Deals physical damage and has an average weight for spironell and ring wing 6 and requires some points in strength and some dexterity in order to use the spike spear is more or less the same as the partisan as they have similar length they have similar attack rating and weight and both can be acquired quite early in the game however the spike spear has natively build up on it making it the better choice between the two as long as you don't care about appearance sacred and Flame art and Magic are essentially tied for highest attack rating with fire and lighting coming in second and Keen way back in third Keane barely outperforms heavy by 10 attack rating so it's not super important which you choose I like to pair this spear with another bleed build up spear like a second spiked spear or cross naganada for increased attack damage with L1 attacks utilizing the bleeding in boss fights as it doesn't normally trigger out on the landscape or when facing basic enemies use Wing sword Insignia and Millicent's profuses to boost attack power and have high protection and Poise you can trade damage ideally while using the spear Talisman only slot Lord of blood's exaltation during boss fights since you won't need it any other time next is the cross naganada the cross naganada has a unique moveset compared to other spheres with a combination of pokes and slashes and Deals physical damage and has a heavy weight for a spear and Elden ring wing 8 and requires some points in strength and some dexterity in order to use the cross naganada is arguably the best all-around Spirit known ring that has the highest attack rating barely edging out the bolt of grand sax it's one of the longest Spears that has natively built upon hit and it can be acquired relatively early in the game in Gale tunnel the only negative is that it's rather heavy for a spear fire and lighting take the top spot when it comes to attack rating with magic coming in second and Flame art and sacred coming in a close third Kian out performs heavy by 31 points making this a deck's weapon versus strength with cold even outperforming heavy I like to play this weapon as a hybrid build because even splitting your stats between faith and dexterity you still have decent attack rating and then you can buff your weapon with blood flame blade or lightning Armament while also boosting your damage with Golden Valley and Flame gravity strength when combined with an ash of War like repeating thrust you can boost your attack power over 1200 with talismans like Wing sword Insignia Millicent's prosthesis making this a very deadly weapon up next is the splayman sarpoon the Clayman sarpoon shares the default attack of most Spears and Deals physical and Magic damage it has an average weight for a spironell and ring wing 5.5 and requires some points in strength dexterity and intelligence in order to use the Clayman sarpoon is a phenomenal sphere and one of few weapons that can be infused while also dealing another damage type other than physical it has exceptional attack rating falling just behind the cross nag ignata and you can acquire it rather early by farming the Clayman in siafra River sacred and Flame art have the highest attack rating followed by Magic at a close second and fire and lighting at distant third heavy outperforms Keen by about 20 attack rating making this weapon lean a little bit more to the strength side of things the Clayman sarpoon is extremely versatile and there are really so many different ways that you can play it but I actually recommend to leave the weapon on its standard infusion because this way you can boost its damage with strength and intelligence and you can still buff it with Scholars Armament when buff with 50 strength and 50 and you will hit close to 800 attack rating and you can further increase this with magic shred and cracked here and Magic scorpion charm throw in something like repeating thrust and rotten Wings sword Insignia and you'll have reached well over 1200 attack rating which is a lot and last we come to the celebrant's rear brake the celebrant's rib rake shares the default attack of most Spears and Deals physical damage it has a light weight for spironolang 5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use the celebrant's rubric is the worst spear inelden ring not only does it have the lowest attack rating but it can take you hours to farm in Windmill Village which is a decent ways into the game The only positive of this weapon is that it provides you with 10 runes when you damage an enemy with it however it does have an internal cooldown that shares the same timer with any other Severance rip break so dual wielding them doesn't even help you gain more runes fire and lightning are essentially tied with magic for the top spot with flame art and sacred falling just behind and Keen pulling up a distant third key now performs heavy with this Weapon by about 35 points so you definitely want to use Keen over heavy if you don't like any of the other infusions I recommend avoiding this weapon entirely but if you do wish to use it pair it with another deck scaling Spear and dual wield it for fast L1 attacks that help you mask its load damage use similar talismans and gear to other dual wield spear setups well that wraps up our video on Spears and the pros and cons of each one and how they can be used to own ring I hope you guys found this very informational we have more weapon videos yet to go if you'd like to see a particular weapon group we haven't done yet please leave that in the

Title: Great Spears are the Best Weapon in Elden Ring - Elden Ring All Great Spears Breakdown
Video ID: xtJaJtCmkxc
Transcript Text:
in the cell numbering video I'm going to be showing you why great Spears are the best weapon in Elden ring this is our 16th video showcasing all the weapons in a given category going through their pros and cons to help you make a better decision if you wanted to be part of your build or not before I get into the weapons themselves however first let's take a look at what the pros and cons of this weapon group are as well as the styles of play I think most players will use when using a great sphere the first pro of this weapon group is their exceptional reach most of them have very very long reach allowing me to hit enemies from a safe distance they also deal piercing damage which can deal counter damage in this game if you didn't know when you're attacking enemies while they are attacking you in their Ford animation with thrust damage you deal what is called counter damage which is increased damage to them and since all the great spheres deal at least some thrust damage possible to get counter damage with them and because of their Long Reach it makes it easier for them to do which is why the spear Talisman does increase counter damage and it's named after this weapon group additionally great Spears have a running attack that hits multiple times in Rapid succession and usually pushes the enemy back following this animation which allows you to use things like right wing sword Insignia or Millicent's prosthesis to great effect when using this attack as you can stack this buff instantly just by doing one running attack with a single great spear additionally this weapon group can block and attack at the same time not unlike spheres or thrusting swords or heavy thrusting swords additionally when dual wielding this weapon the running L2 attack is extremely deadly as is the jump attack with both weapons the cons of this weapon group are that they deal mostly thrust damage which can be resisted making it difficult for them to deal damage against some enemies and thrusting attacks have sometimes difficulty hitting concave shaped enemies where you lock onto their torso because they're the farthest distance from you additionally five of the six great Spears cannot be infused meaning that you're stuck with the action war on them whether you like it or not and a lot of these weapons cannot be found very easily in the game moving on to the styles of play that I think people will use when using a great spear I think it's highly likely that most players will either use a great shield and a single great spear doing a block counter style of play or that they will dual wield great Spears trying to hit rapidly with L2 attacks the deal increased damage or doing jump attacks with L2 those things being said let's move into the great spheres themselves starting with the unique great Spears and the first one is the tree spear the tree spear has a unique R2 chain the first R2 is a heavy forward thrust similar to the lances R2 and then it has a downward diagonal slash starting from your left side and Deals physical and holy damage it has an average weight for a great spear in Elden ring weighing 9.5 and requires some points in strength dexterity and faith in order to use the tree spirit is a unique weapon because it deals both physical and holy damage yet it can still be buff it's the third longest great sphere and you can find it relatively early in learning off the Lakes holy damage is not great but it deals about 65 physical damage so that's a small consolation its weapon skill sacred order Buffs your damage by 10 as well as increases your damage versus Undead by 100 for 60 seconds this buff Stacks with golden valve and Flame grant me strength but does not stack with other weapon Buffs like lightning Armament this allows you to use it both inside and outside of Faith builds note that will also increase your damage if you swap off this weapon after casting the spot the tree sphere scales best with dexterity and its sweet spawn is 50 dexterity with minimum points in faith and strength which scale very similarly to one another I do recommend getting Faith to at least 25 when using this weapon though since you can use Golden valve that way which is a natural pairing with this weapon focus on strength after Faith hits 25 in order to use a great Shield but then swap back to dexterity until you hit 80. because sacred order only needs to be used every 60 seconds the tree sphere is a great candidate to be paired with a jellyfish Shield which can also boost damage this allows you to get over 1200 attack rating when stacking Buffs and play a block counter-style play with very high attack rating with regular attacks and r2s additionally the great spear makes a good candidate for an offhand weapon if you're planning a dual weld setup because its weapon skill sacred order will also buff your main hand and this allows you to use a weapon skill in your main hand that can do some other effect next up we have serpent Hunter the serpent Hunter has an R2 attack that has a horizontal slash similar to solarius tree and vyke's warsphere and Deals physical damage it's the heaviest great spear inel in ring Wang 12 and requires zero stats in order to use the serpent Hunter is essentially a cross between a great sword and a great spear it has poking attacks with its r1s but also has slashing attacks with its r2s it's tied for the shortest great spirit in Elden ring and it's also the heaviest great spear but it does have zero requirements so you could theoretically use it from the very beginning of the game on any character if you could get one but it's not located until the end of volcano Manor which is a ways into the game great serpanot is a deadly weapon skill dealing incredible damage if you can land it or its follow-up attack you can often one or two shot most enemies with it because it deals thrust damage which also allows it to deal counter damage which is further improved by the spirit Talisman so I highly recommend using this if you use this weapon Shard of Alexander or Warrior jar Shard are also must for this weapon it has an incredible long windup though making it tough to use against mobile targets but it does have insane Poise allowing you to tank everything but the heaviest hits the sweet spot for this weapon is about 55 strength but it scales well up to 80 strength and scales better than most weapons up to 99. no other attributes are needed for this weapon I like to use this weapon two-handed to get additional damage from the strength scaling and to lean integrate servant hunt for tough enemies I use the running R2 attack that hits multiple times against weaker enemies and use its regular R2 when I need to AOE a group of enemies you can also block counter effectively this weapon since it has 55 guard boost at Max upgrade which you can improve further with a great Shield Talisman up next We have solarius tree solarius tree has an R2 slashing attack similar to The Serpent Hunter and vyke's War Spear and Deals physical and holy damage it has an average weight for a great spirit known ring weighing 10 and requires a lot of points in strength and some index dirty and faith in order to use solarius tree is a deadly great spear with the second longest reach but it can't be acquired until deep root deaths and it deals 50 holy damage which is resisted by many of the hardest bosses in Elven ring Solari as well hits like an absolute truck and has great range when charged which subsequently increases its damage when combined with Godfrey icon and chart of Alexander you can one shot some of the most challenging enemies in one use from a safe distance making it one of the stronger weapon skills in Alden Ring The Sweet Spot for this weapon is about 50 strength and 50 Faith with minimum dexterity you'll continue to increase these to 80 before taking dexterity to 50. all three stats increase the weapon's skill damage which does a mix of physical and holy so there is no reason to prioritize one over the other unlike with some other weapons because this weapon naturally scales with strength and Faith it makes a good candidate for the claw Mark seal as well as a great shield for Block counters celerius tree is extremely long and this means it's easy to connect on nearly every block counter and this also allows you to use solarius well when needed I'm not next we come to vike's war Spirit Vikes warspear has a slashing R2 attacks you'll learn to serpent Hunter and slurius tree and Deals physical and fire damage it's the lightest great spear in Elden ring wing 8 and requires some points in strength dexterity and faith in order to use fike's worst fears claim to fame is of course that it does Madness buildup making it a PVP weapon by Nature though it can still be used in PVE just without Madness playing a huge role it's also tied for the shortest great Spear and causes Madness build upon yourself when you use its weapon skill frenzy flame thrust frenzy flame thrust launches into the air coming down plunging your spear into the ground with flames coming out all around you if you connect with the spear you deal much more damage than just the fire to try to land on your target if possible it's not the greatest weapon skill but it's certainly better than most especially since the fire will continue to damage enemies for a couple seconds after the skill has been completed the sweet spot for this weapon is around 50 dexterity and minimum requirements in both strength and Faith however this weapon scales well up to 80 decks dirty I would then take Faith up to 50 and strength up to 50 but consider taking Faith up to 25 earlier on in order to use Golden bow I like to use this weapon in a dual great spear setup with the tree spear in the other hand this is because they have very similar scaling in because sacred order will buff both weapons and then you're free to use frenzy flame thrust as needed easily the running L2 hits many times so be sure to use rotten Wing sword Insignia Millicent's prosthesis or Wing sword Insignia with this build if possible jump attacks also do stupid damage with this setup so the cloth Talisman is also a great choice and the last unique great spirit is magwin's sacred sphere magwin sacred spear shares the default attack of other great Spears and Deals physical and fire damage has an average weight for a great spiritual ring weighing 10 and requires a lot of points and strength in Arcane and some dexterity in order to use Mach 1's sacred spear is the longest great spear in Elden ring and it does natively build upon hit but you have to beat moglord of blood to get it which can be difficult to do early on in the game its weapon skill blood moon ritual is deadly if you can execute it in a group of enemies or up close against a boss but it has a long animation that can be interrupted if not timed properly you can cast it three times in a row which can wipe out bosses in what go and it does bleed build up as well the sweet spot for this weapon is around 55 Arcane and 50 strength with Arcane not only increasing both physical and fire damage but also increasing blood buildup on hit so you'll want to prioritize that over strength the weapon also scales OK up to 80 dexterity so you'll eventually want to take this up as well because of the strength this weapon needs it makes a good candidate to pair with a great Shield or you can use it alone to gain extra damage from two handing make sure to use the Lord of Bloods exiltation in boss fights and the spear Talisman for extra counter damage and lastly we come to the Lance which is the only non-unique great beer the land shares the default attack of other great Spears and Deals physical damage and has a light weight for a spear and Elder ring weighing 9 and requires some points in strength and some dexterity in order to use the Lance is the only great sphere that can be infused and have its Astro War replaced and it can also be found very early in the game in Lim grave Southwest of death touched catacombs its damage is similar to that of the unique Spears though that shouldn't be a consideration when using this weapon fire and lightning and sacred and Flame art are essentially tied for first place when it comes to damage with magic coming in a close second and heavy a distant third heavy outperforms Keen by about 12 attack rating at this point in the game which is not much and cold is not far behind Keen because you have many different infusions available to you you can either go dual wield with any other great spear or you can use a great shield and block counter with heavy cold or fire very easily this makes the Lance a bit more flexible than some other great Spears and is a good pairing with other great Spears as you can set the infusion to match the sphere you're pairing it with so that wraps up our video on great Spears I hope you found it informational one thing I forgot to mention earlier that I do want to mention is that great Spears do not fluctuate much between weight and damage there's only about a four or three weight fluctuation across the entire group and the damage is only about 20 to 25 damage and attack rating from the lowest to highest in this group so I did not mention you know which ones deal the most damage or least damage in this group because there's such little variance it doesn't matter that much stay tuned for more Elden ring content on this channel we still have more weapons to do I plan to get around to Shields and armor as well as some talismans and Ashes of War as well I might start mixing those in in the coming weeks just to mix it up a little bit do something a little bit fresh keep weapons and other things for a little bit later we'll see how that goes let me know what you guys want to see in the comments if there's certain ashes of War you want to see or weapons or armor let me know in the comments below [Music] thank you

Title: Flails are the Best Weapon in Elden Ring - Elden Ring All Flails Breakdown
Video ID: 7yq8Qo1cBJw
Transcript Text:
in this Elden ring video I'm going to be showing you why flails are the best weapon in Elden ring this is the 17th video in a series of videos that we've done where we go through all the weapons in a given weapon category showcase their strengths and weaknesses and give you tips about how to use them if you want to use them in their build it has been an extremely long time since I've done one of these videos back before balers Gate 3 back before Diablo 4 we're talking like six months or so since I've done one of these videos this is backed by popular demand and I decided to start with flails first predominantly just to get back into the swing of things it has a low weapon count this is a very difficult weapon group to use admittedly but there are some advantages to using some of these flails however before we get into each of the five flails let's talk about the pros and cons of flails and play Styles I think most players will use when using them so first up is the pros this weapon type has high Poise damage if you're going for stance breaks flails is not a bad weapon type it has decent attack speed although its chain is not as fast as something maybe like straight swords it's it's still rather quick it has good block counter range and good block counter Poise damage so if you're looking for a good block counter weapon flails are definitely you know should be on your list and all non-unique flails have native bleed buildup on hit which is fantastic this is not something that's going to come in real Handy out on the landscape where you kill enemies typically in a few hits anyway before bleed will trigger but when you're in boss fights this can come in really handy if it triggers once or twice the cons of this weapon group are that their charg R2 has a very long wind up making it very difficult to use so even though the weapon has very high Poise damage it's hard to use charge star to attacks there are not a ton of flails to choose from and their move sets are all exactly the same so there is not a lot of wide variety in terms of what you're getting from flails additionally their dual wield move set is kind of staggered meaning their attacks are not synced up so dual wield move set is not so great with this weapon type the ash of War on the non-unique spinning chain is not very good it's very difficult to use and flails themselves only have a small selection of Ashes of War they can use compared to some other weapon groups so there are quite a few cons to this weapon type and when you're talking about play styles that I think most people use when using a flail I think most people will use it with a shield that's simply because of the Poise damage that the weapon doesn't block counters and the reach is fairly good additionally the you know dual wield move set is kind of bad and there's only probably a couple weapons you would probably use some sort of like magic type build with them out of all of them so I think typically you're going to see this with with a shield okay those things being said let's start with the unique flails first first up is the family heads family heads shares the default attack of other flails and Deals physical and Magic damage it's tied for the second lightest flail in Elden ring Wang 5.5 and requires some points in strength dexterity and intelligence in order to use the family heads is one of two unique flails in Elden ring and can be found in the sages cave and Altus Plateau so it's not exactly easy to get early on but it's not tough either it has a decent attack rate rating at 661 with about 66% of that being physical damage unless you invest heavily into intelligence then you'll get closer to a 50/50 split between physical and Magic its weapon skill familiar ranker does 100% magic damage that doesn't increase with dexterity though intelligence does boost the damage of it by about eight damage at Max upgrade per point of intelligence this makes things a bit tricky since you have to either prioritize normal attack damage with dexterity or familial ranker damage with intelligence or some combination ritual sword Talisman Shard of Alexander magic scorpion charm all increase the damage of this weapon skill and thus should be considered when using family heads The Sweet Spot for this weapon is about 55 dexterity and minimum requirements in strength and intelligence and I highly recommend this stat spread if not a bit more in strength in order to use some decent medium Shields the damage difference between high in and minint with familiar ranker is not terrible being only about 400 damage when fully buffed at end game you could theoretically use this weapon with high intelligence instead of dexterity in order to be able to cast sorceries effectively but you would lose out on a lot of melee damage in order to do so for this reason I think it's best to lean into the unique nature of this weapon and weapon skill and prioritize dexterity since there are better weapons to pair with high intelligence builds like the bastard Stars remember to use caran filigreed Crest with this weapon to reduce familiar rankers cost from 25 to 19 FP assassin celan dagger can also help offset FP costs if you use a shield and block counter often up next is the bastard starus the bastard starus shares the default attack of other flails and Deals physical and Magic damage it's tied for the second lightest fla on El ring wing 5.5 and requires some points in strength and a lot in dexterity and intelligence in order to use the bastard stards is one of two unique flails in elen ring and can be found after defeating Asel natural warn of the Void boss which is pretty far into the game it has very good attack rating at 657 with about 66% of that being magic damage which is kind of the opposite of family heads nebula its weapon skill does almost exclusively magic damage just like familiar ranker except for the melee portion of the attack where you actually connect with the weapon itself this does a mix of physical magic damage with most of the steel baing magic this means that dexterity will increase the melee portion but not the rest while intelligence will increase boow nebula is also an exceptionally High dealing damage weapon skill and hits like a truck so if you're looking for a very high damage weapon skill bastard Stars might be a good choice The Sweet Spot for this weapon is about 50 intelligence and minimum requirements in strength and dexterity though it still scals relatively well up to 80 intelligence and outperforms increasing dexterity most of the way making it ideal for intelligence focused builds and also good for NG plus where you can increase dexterity to get more damage out of it this makes it a much better weapon if you plan to cast sorceries when using it compared to the family heads remember to use Kion fig pressed with this weapon to reduce nebula's cost from 25 to 15 and Magic scorpion charm to boost its normal attacks as well as nebula damage assassin suring dagger can also help offset FP costs if you use a shield and block counter often up next we come to the non-unique flails with the first being the flail the flail shares the default attack of other flails and Deals physical damage it's the lightest flail in Elden ring Wang 5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use the flail has the lowest damage of all flails an Elden ring but it can be acquired extremely early on in the gate front ruins allowing you a flail option almost immediately after beginning the game additionally its damage is not so much lower than other flails that it can't be competitive later on it is the second longest flail though flails are nearly all the same length and much like other non-unique flails it has native bleed buildup which can be deadly in boss fights its weapon skill spinning chain is not easy to use and has an extremely long wind up when using its follow-up attack that makes it damn near impossible to land I highly recommend that if you're using this weapon you swap its weapon skill out early on for something else like maybe wild strikes or flaming strike infusion wise sacred and Flame Arts come in first with magic just behind and lightning and fire coming in at third Keen outperforms heavy here but not by a whole lot so you could go either if you want cold is also another good option if you want a second status effect and will trigger more often than Hemorrhage since you'll have more buildup if you really like the flail I'd recommend waiting a bit longer to use the Night Rider flail since it does more damage looks a hell of a lot cooler and can be found shortly after this one however if you insist on using it I'd go cold with a shield for Block counters and nice burst against bosses next is the Night Rider flail the Night Rider flail shares the default attack of other flails and Deals physical damage it's the second heaviest flil in Elden ring weighing six and requires some points in strength and a lot of dexterity to use the Night Rider flail is an upgraded version of the flail in nearly every way though it is very slightly shorter and can be acquired by defeating the knight's Cavalry and weeping peninsula which is not that much further than gatefront ruins it does have much higher dexterity requirements at 24 though which might make it tougher to use early on before you've had a chance to level up enough much like the flail spinning weapon is a terrible Ash of War since it's difficult to pull off has short range and the follow-up is extremely hard to land so like the flail I highly recommend that if you're using this weapon you swap its weapon skill out for something else early on infusion wise fire and lightning comes in first with magic in second and sacred and Flame art and a close third the weapon scales much better when dexterity or the Keen scaling than strength which is heavy scaling but cold is also a great option with only slightly less damage than Keen make sure you have enough strength to use a decent medium shield with this weapon for Block counters but don't put any more than necessary and lastly we come to the chain link flail the chainlink flail shares the default attack of other flails and Deals physical damage it's the heaviest flail in Elden ring wing eight and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use the chainlink flail has the highest attack rating of all non-unique flails and basically has has the same attack rating as unique flails but it leans a bit more to the strength side than the Night Rider flail it's found from lesser pumpkin head enemies that roam the landscape which are not too much further than the Night Rider flail if you don't mind the look of it much like the flail and Night Rider flail spinning weapon is a terrible Ash of War since it's difficult to pull off has short range and the follow-up is extremely hard to land so again if you are using this weapon I recommend swapping out the ash of War early on infusion wise fire and lightning come in first with magic in second and sacred and Flame art just behind in third heavy outperforms Keen by a modest amount and cold is just behind heavy if you wish to go that route it's also worth noting that poison is much more viable on this flail as has an attack rating of 536 compared to the 520 and 450 of the Night Rider and flail when set to this Fusion of all the flails the chainlink flail makes the best use of a shield and flail setup due to its high attack rating and strength scaling making it a solid choice to pair with a great shield for turtling and block counters so that wraps up our video on flails and why they're the best weapon in and Elden ring they are seriously far from the best weapon that I have tested in this game that is the name of our series and I hope I showed you how you can get something out of your flails if you are using one in the game stay tuned for more Elden Rings videos in this vein and also some other Elden ring content as we gear up for 2024 and hopefully the release of the DLC if there's a weapon type we have not done yet that you would like to see let me know in the comments [Music] below [Music] w

Title: Axes are the Best Weapon in Elden Ring - Elden Ring All Axes Breakdown
Video ID: YlN3p2dB1-o
Transcript Text:
in this Elden ring video I'm going to be showing you why axes are the best weapon in Elden ring this is our 18th video in a series of videos where we go through each weapon in a given weapon category and go through the pros and cons of them and why you might use them in your build however before we get into the weapons themselves let's first take a look at the pros and cons of the axes themselves or as a group and the play Styles I think most players who are using axes will use so let's talk about the pros first and first step for pros is that there's a large variety of different axes that have different move sets within axes themselves so not each ax is the same whereas you know when we did the flails video pretty much the flails had the same move set no matter what flail you're using axes have a wide variety of move set so if you don't like one axe you might like another Axe and experimenting with axes you might find one that you like just because of the move set alone another really big Pro to this weapon group is that most of the weapons or most of the axes in Elden ring are found very early in the game or like within the first third of the game so you can get all of these axes try them out mess around with them very early in the game and decide which one you like or if you know which one you want to use already you can just beine for it and get it and play it from you know basically pretty early on in the game and the last thing is that they have pretty decent attack speed they're obviously much faster than some of the heavier weapons in the game and there is kind of like a subset of axes within the axes category that some people have kind of dubbed light axes that attack even faster than other axes in this group these are primarily ones that have very low equipment weight and they're very short us usually but they attack rather quickly so if you're looking for a weapon with decent attack speed some of these axes can be very good the cons of this weapon group is that some of them have extremely short length making it difficult to hit enemies with them even when enemies are very near to you so that can be an absolute problem for this weapon group and the other con is that there are very few axes with Native status effect buildup there's like one that has frostbite and one that has bleed build up out of 13 axes and that's it so if you're looking to do some sort of status effect build probably looking at doing one of those two axes otherwise you might have a difficult time unless you're like doing some sort of specialized build and when it comes to play Styles I think most people will use when using axes I think most people will use an axe with a shield and that's because the dual wield move set of axes is not particularly great their attacks are not synchronized meaning that they tend to be staggered and somewhat the same speed as like a one-handed weapon generally so you're not really going to use that move set very effectively compared to the dual wield move set of a lot of other weapons in this game and additionally there's only one unique axe that lends itself very well to a spell axe sort of build in this game and I think there are a lot better weapons out there in other weapon groups that kind of make sense if you're trying to make like a spellcaster hybrid sort of build so then we come to axe and shield which we just kind of get there by process of elimination because if you're not do a wielding and you're not using it in some sort of hybrid spellcaster build what's in your off hand probably going to be a shield so that's why I think a lot of people will use ax and shield so so let's jump into the axes themselves we'll start with the unique axes first first one up is the icen hatchet the iceren hatchet shares the default attack of other axes though it attacks faster than most other axes and Deals physical damage it's the second lightest axe in Elden ring W 3 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use the iceren hatchet has a lot going for it it attacks faster than most axes it's extremely lightweight it's the only axe that does frostbite on hit and it can be found pretty early on in the game with a horseback ride into learning of the Lakes however it does have the lowest attack rating of all axis its weapon skill hor Frost stomp does 100% magic damage can set frost bite rather easily and is relatively cheap at 10 FP though its damage is rather low for a weapon skill dexterity does increase the damage of this skill but not as much as you would think this makes optimizing the damage of this weapon rather tricky since boosting magic damage does nothing for the normal attacks and boosting physical damage does nothing for hor Frost Stop The Sweet Spot for this weapon is at about 55 deck dexterity and minimum strength it scales fine up to 80 dexterity at which point you would switch to strength making it very well suited for a first playthrough and maybe NG plus but not much further than that I'd likely use this weapon with a medium or lighter great shield for Block counters using hor Frost stomp when facing many enemies or difficult ones to kill ritual sword Talisman is not a bad pairing with this weapon since it will boost both hor Frost Stomp and regular attacks as long as you maintain full HP and Millis prosthesis and rotten Wing sword Insignia are not bad because it attacks so quickly up next is the Ripple Blade the Ripple blade shares its light and strong attacks with the Warped Axe and Deals physical damage it has an average weight for an accident ring weighing 4.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity and a good amount in Arcane in order to use the Ripple blade is a rather unique weapon sharing its native Arcane scaling with the Ripple Crescent halber and is excellent for builds that use the dragon communion seal to cast the incantations it's one of the longest axes in El ring and has decent attack rating however it's claimed to fame as how well it synergizes with blood poison and saric greases since these take into account the native Arcane scaling making them more effective on this weapon and the Ripple Crescent halir than every other weapon in the game its weapon skill wild strikes is phenomenal especially when paired with greases and can be used to set status effects or deal damage very easily but its charged R2 after an R2 is particularly amazing as it hits twice quickly allowing you to finish off enemies fast and take advantage of the axxe Talisman effectively The Sweet Spot for this weapon is around 55 or so Arcane but it scales very well up to 80 where it drops off significantly since it has no other scaling it lends itself much better to a first playthrough or maybe NG plus but not further than that I'd play this weapon with a shield in the off hand with a dragon communion seal as a backup to cast the incantations with buff with grease for hard to kill enemies and bosses but otherwise just use incantations to buff when not facing them make sure to use the axe Talisman to take advantage of the weapons unique charged R2 attacks up next is the stormhawk axe the stormhawk axe sheares the default attack of other axes and Deals physical damage it's one of the heavier axes in El ring weighing 5.5 and requires a decent amount of strength and some dexterity in order to use the storm Hawk axe is deadly not only does it have the highest attack rating among axes when buffed with thunderstorm but it is also one of the longest and you can acquire it pretty early on in the game the downside is that it can be missed early on if you don't know how to get it thunderstorm is a great weapon skill that not only deals high damage but adds 120 lightning damage to your weapon for 40 seconds however you will likely only use this very situationally on hard to kill enemies and bosses because it is expensive at 19 FP and even more expensive if you follow up twice at a total FP cost of 43 and even though its damage is very high for a weapon skill it does very little stance damage meaning you will need High Poise and a good opening to pull off both follow-ups without being interrupted The Sweet Spot for this weapon is at about 55 strength and 45 dexterity but it scales decently up to 80 in both stats making it excellent for NG plus and Beyond priority ize strength early on for more damage and to help meet the requirements for Shields you may use because you'll have a good amount of strength with this weapon I highly recommend using it with a great shield and no skill so you can cast thunderstorm whenever you want while block countering the rest of the time both caran filigreed Crest and assassin Cillian dagger can help keep the cost of thunderstorm manageable early on in the game when you have lower mind and fewer flasks so I highly recommend using one or both of them early on again make sure you have high Poise armor too so that you can use thunderstorm without interruption and note that sword Insignia rotten Wing sword Insignia millison prothesis nor the thorny crack tier trigger from thunderstorms use so do not incorporate those into a build using this weapon and the last unique axe is roses's Axe roses's axe shares the default attack of other axes and Deals physical and Magic damage it's one of the heavier axes in El ring wing 5.5 and requires a decent amount of strength and intelligence and some dexterity in order to use roses's axe is a lot better than some would think it's the longest axe in Elden ring and has the second highest attack rating of all axes when unbuffed and it can be found somewhat early on in the game its biggest downsides are that it has split physical and magical damage 2/3 physical and 1/3 magic which really isn't that bad and that its weapon skill can be somewhat difficult to pull off sometimes its weapon skill roses' summons deal significant damage but it has a very long windup and isn't cheap making it difficult to use against hyper aggressive enemies or are all that frequently it deals both physical and Magic damage in the same ratio as the weapon itself which makes it hard to boost its damage as effect as some other weapon skills since exalted flesh only affects part of its damage and Magic scorpion charm and Magic shrouded cracker only affect an even smaller portion of its damage The Sweet Spot for this weapon is at about 55 strength and minimum requirements in both dexterity and intelligence however the weapon scales decently up to 80 strength and 50 or so in intelligence but take strength up first and then intelligence unless you want to meet the requirements for some spells or if you wish to make a spell axe sort of Bill out of the unique axes roses's axe makes a solid candidate for a hybrid Bild that but also spell cast since it has high attack rating and Deals some magic damage anyway and even though you cannot change the axe's weapon skill you might not need to use it that often especially if you're casting spells with your FP and just using it to melee with high attack rating so next we move on to the non-unique axes or the axes that can be infused and first up is the hand axe the hand ax shares the default attack of other axes though it attacks faster than most of them and Deals physical damage it's the third lightest axe in Elden ring weighing 3.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use the hand axe is not the deadliest axe in Elden ring being that it has neither excellent damage nor reach but it does have the lowest requirements of all axes attacks faster than most axes and can be purchased very early in the game from the nomatic merchant and East Lim grave for 600 runes Quick Step is neither a great nor poor Ash of war and can certainly be used to position yourself behind enemies to keep attacking but is not consistently useful when fighting regular enemies out of the landscape I suggest replacing it with a more offensive weapon skill when you can get one infusion wise magic comes in at 642 attack rating with sacred inflame art at 637 and fire and lightning just behind at 636 he and heavy are pretty much the same attack rating with cold just behind I'd play this weapon with a great Shield taking the heavier cold infusions using something like sword dance or wild strikes for ash of War when needed use winged sword Insignia or similar talismans when facing bosses and spamming R1 attacks since this weapon attacks quickly next is the fork Hatchet the fork Hatchet shares the default attack of other axes but attacks more quickly and Deals physical damage it's the lightest axe in Elden ring weigh 2.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use the fork Hatchet is one of only two axes with Native status effects and the only one that causes bleed and the only one that can be infused it's the lightest axe in elen ring attacks very quickly and can be found rather early from imps that wield it the downside is it has the second lowest attack rating of all axes much like the hand axe Quick Step is a neither great nor poor Ash of war and I highly recommend swapping it out for something more offensive that you can use regularly sword dance or wild strikes are both valid options particularly sword dance due to how short the fork Hatchet is infusion wise magic comes in first at 69 attack rating with sacred inflame art at 586 and fire and lightning at 579 Keen outperforms heavy 545 to 530 with cold outperforming both making it a great option for dual status effects I'd run this weapon with a shield and cold infusion trying to apply frostbite and Hemorrhage utilize Wild and higho armor to prevent interruption or use sword dance to Gap close compensating for the short range of the weapon next is the battle axe the battle ax shares the default attack of other axes and Deals physical damage it has an average weight for an axe in ELD and ring wing 4.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use the battle axe is a very well-rounded axe in Elden ring the hero class begins the game with it and you can get one very early on and Round Table hold if you didn't begin as a hero it has better than average reach for an Axe and it's in the upper half of axes in terms of attack rating its weapon skill wild strikes is pretty good especially if you have decent Poise and can kill many enemies easily infusion wise magic comes in first at 688 with flame art and sacred coming in second at 683 and fire lightning coming in at 676 heavy outperforms Keen by about 26 attack rating which isn't a huge amount and cold outperform ke as well I'd play this weapon with a great Shield using block counters and using wild strikes to dispatch difficult to kill enemies and bosses go heavy fire or cold for good strength scaling that allows you to use a great Shield more easily up next is the Warped axe the Warped axe shares its attack pattern with the Ripple blade and Deals physical damage it's the heaviest axe in Elder ring weighing 7.5 and requires a lot of points in strength and sumon dexterity in order to use the Warped axe is arguably the go-to axe if you're just looking for raw damage it has the highest attack rating of all axes when none are buffed it's one of the longer axes in elen ring and can be found relatively early on in the game by farming Cliff bottom catacombs and learning of the Lakes however it does have the high highest requirements of all axis its weapon skill war cry is a bit strange on this weapon war cry boosts physical damage and strength scaling for 40 seconds while also converting charged attacks of the warp axe into a running attack however one of the unique things about the Warped axe is its second charged R2 attack that hits twice so I don't see why you'd want to overwrite that with war cry I highly recommend changing the ash of War to something else because of this infusion wise fire and lightning tops the list at a whopping 745 attack rating they give you some idea the great Axe which has the highest damage of all great weapons in know ring has an 810 attack rating with the fire infusion and attacks much more slowly magic comes in second at 722 and heavy at third at 714 attack rating heavy outperforms Keen which only has 668 attack rating you definitely want to lean into the strength scaling of this weapon definitely play this weapon with a great shield for block counter since you'll have high strength anyway and make sure to use the axe Talisman to take advantage of the weapon's unique charged R2 attacks the termination or Royal Knights resolve are not bad choices either to further boost R2 attacks and block counter damage next is the jabone axe the jaone axe shares the default attack of other axes and Deals physical damage one of the heavier axes in El ring weighing 5.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use the Jawbone axe Is Not a Bad Axe nor is it a great one it does have higher attack rating than most axes it has excellent strength scaling and can be farmed rather easily from ancestral followers however it's only in the middle in terms of range and the battle axe is nearly identical when it comes to damage range and weapon skill and is even easier to get its weapon skill wild strikes is pretty good especially if you have decent pois and can kill many enemies easily infusion wise magic comes in first at 698 attack rating with sacred inflame art just behind at 693 and fire and lightning at 687 heavy outperforms Keen by a mile with 674 attack rating to 622 and cold is not bad at 660 attack rating like most axes this weapon plays well with a shield or great Shield since you'll typically have high strength block countering as needed up next is the iron Cleaver the iron Cleaver shares the same move set with the celebran Cleaver and Deals physical damage it's the second heaviest axe in elen ring wiang six and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use the iron Cleaver is a very strong candidate for a hybrid build with its high attack rating rapid attack speed and fantastic charg R2 that can Gap close from a decent distance away can also be found fairly early on in the game by farming Mis begot and Castle Mo the downside is that it's very short for making it easy to miss enemies its weapon skill wild strikes is pretty good especially if you have decent pois and can kill many enemies easily however you may find that you use the charged R2 more since it's a lot safer to use so you may want to swap this for something like determination or Royal Knights resolve infusion wise magic comes in at a substantial 728 attack rating making the weapon a great choice for sorcerer users and surprisingly heavy comes in it second at 690 attack rating outperforming Keen by a huge 52 attack rating I'd play this this weapon as some sort of hybrid strength intelligence build or just go the intelligence route and cast spells while using it to melee as needed if you're playing strength intelligence you can buff the weapon with skull's Armament and if intelligence only you can use something like R Knight's resolve to buff charge R2 damage can I be sure to use the axe Talisman to further boost charge R2 attacks and wings sword Insignia and similar talismans also work well against bosses due to the high attack speed of your R1 attacks next we come to the Highland axe the Highland axe shares the default attack of other axes and Deals physical damage it has an average weight for an axe Andel ring wing 4.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use the Highland axe is a fantastic axe for several reasons first it's the only axe with 110 critical making it ideal for block counter builds that utilize axes second is the second longest axe in Elden Ring third you can find it in storm Vil Castle which is not too far into the game and lastly it Buffs Roar attacks passively as long as it's in either your left or right hand even if you're two-handing a right-hand weapon note that this does not affect dragon breath spells its weapon skill war cry is fitting for the weapon war cry boosts physical damage and strength scaling for 40 seconds while also converting the charged R2 attack of the Highland axe into a running attack the damage dealt when buffed with war cry is then Amplified by the Highland axe's passive feature infusion wise magic comes in first at 682 attack rating with sacred and Flame art coming in at second at 678 and fire and lightning coming in at third at 668 heavy outperforms Keen 618 to 598 at this level and cold outperforms Keen I'd recommend using this weapon with a great shield and leaning into block counters because of the increased critical damage it has having a weapon skill that does good stance damage is also a good idea like stamp upward cut or kind of like the way I played in my Gladiator build up next is the CBR Cleaver the cbr's cleaver shares the same move set of the iron Cleaver and Deals physical damage has an average weight for an ax and elen ring weighing 4.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use the cbr's cleaver is a bit of a mixed bag on one hand hand that has decent attack rating for an Axe and attacks rather quickly its charged R2 attack can be used quite effectively and it grants 10 runes per hit on the other hand it's located a decent ways into the game it can take a really long time to farm and it's the second shortest axe Additionally the iron Cleaver has the same move set so if you like it you have a much earlier option its weapon skill wild strikes is pretty good especially if you have decent Poise and can kill enemies easily but just like the iron Cleaver you may find you use the charged R2 more since it's a lot safer to use so you may want to swap this for something like determination or Royal kns resolve infusion wise magic comes in at 677 attack rating with sacred inflame art just behind at 672 and fire and lightning at 666 heavy barely edges out Keen at 608 to 604 with cold out performing both of them by a small margin at 617 I'd play this weapon with a shield or great shield for Block counters leading into the strength side of things for easier Shield use this means fire cold or heavy infusions wise and I'd be sure to use the axe Talisman to further boost charge R2 attacks use determination or R Knights resolve to buff damage of these attacks for even more success and use Wing sword Insignia and similar Talisman against bosses due to the high attack speed of your R1 attacks and finally we come to the last non-unique axe the sacrificial axe the sacrificial axe shares the default attack of other axes and Deals physical damage it's one of the heavier axes in El ring wing 5.5 and requires some points in strength and dexterity in order to use the sacrificial axe is one that you'll find in a number of builds but rarely is it the focal point of the build and it's typically used in the off hand to refund FP whenever you kill an enemy however it's actually a pretty good weapon in its own right because you get it very quickly in Weeping Peninsula by killing the death right Bird and it has pretty good attack rating for an axe the one downside is that it's pretty short lengthwise its weapon skill wild strikes is pretty good especially if you have decent Poise and can kill enemies easily infusion wise magic comes in first at 711 attack rating with sacred and Flame art at 706 and fire and lightning at 694 heavy outperforms Keen 6 59 to 623 with cold outperforming key I'd play this weapon with a shield of some sort assuming it's my main weapon and I'm not just using it for a buff and pick up an ash of War like sword dance that pulls you forward to make up for its lack of short range additionally sword dance only costs 6 FP for the first attack allowing you to use it nearly free on trash enemies if you kill them afterwards so that wraps up our video on axes and why they are the best weapon in L ring axis are a really really strong weapon type they have very very high attack rating some of the higher end ones and they attack much more quickly than a lot of great weapons I definitely think not enough people consider these weapons in their builds stay tuned for more Elden ring content throughout January February and onward as we get through the rest of the weapon videos and more builds and probably do some other specialized videos as well what did you guys think did you find this helpful did you learn something about axes let me know in the comments [Music] below [Music] w

Title: Hammers are the Best Weapon in Elden Ring - Elden Ring All Hammers Breakdown
Video ID: pIdg6d1REKs
Transcript Text:
in this ELD ring video I'm going to be showing you why hammers are the best weapon in Elden ring this is the 19th video in a series where we go through all the weapons in a given weapon category show you their pros and cons and help you make better decisions about why you might want to use them in your build or not before we get into the Hammers themselves however first let's talk about the pros and cons of hammers and the play styles that I think most people using hammers will use the pros of this weapon group are that they tend to have very high stance damage particularly when doing block counters or charged heavy attacks and they do more stance damage than any weapon in Elden ring that's not great or colossal so that's particularly good if you want to do stance breaks and you like using charged heavy attacks or block counters then this weapon group is very good flails have the same amount of stance damage and they typically have a little bit more reach when doing block counters although the angle can be a bit tricky however their wind up on charged heavy attacks is longer in my experience than hammers so if you like charged heavy attacks hammers is better of the two options the cons of this weapon group is is that they can tend to be quite short compared to some other weapons in the game their dual wield attacks are not synced making dual wield not a very viable option for these weapons and they tend to not have too many status effects on the weapons though a couple of them do and talking a little bit about the play Styles I think most people use before we get into the unique hammers themselves I think most people playing with a hammer will use a great Shield or a shield and play a block counter build particularly because the stance damage on block counters is so good and because this weapon group has four dual wield attack animations okay let's take a look at VAR bokeh which is the first unique Hammer VAR boket shares the default attack of other Hammers and Deals physical damage it's the lightest hammer in Elden ring weighing two and requires eight strength 16 dexterity and 24 Arcane in order to use Faris bouquet has very very low attack rating it's very very low it's the second shortest hammer in Elden ring it can be difficult to acquire and can be missed if you don't know what to do and it has some of the highest stat requirements for a hammer however it is the lightest hammer it does have good bleed buildup on hit and it can be buffed with grease or other weapon buff spells its weapon skill blood tax is not particularly effective since the weapon has such low attack rating and because it has such short reach it also has a long animation which makes it susceptible to being interrupted as well so you likely won't use it that often with this weapon The Sweet Spot for this weapon is around 55 Arcane and minimum requirements in strength and dexterity but it does scale decently up to 80 Arcane in 50 decks or so strength has poor scaling altogether and I don't recommend investing in it however no matter how optimized the damage of this weapon it still has very low attack rating the biggest strength of this weapon is that it can set Hemorrhage very easily and leaning into that can work very well right up until an enemy is immune or very resistant to this status effect for that reason I highly recommend splitting your attributes between faith and Arcane in order to be able to cast the incantations effectively Dragon communion seal and pick up some weapon Buffs that can really help your attack rating this gives you the option to rely more on your spells for damage than your bouquet but you can use your bouquet to charge up your attack power via things like Lord of blood's exaltation white mask and things like millison prothesis and rotten Wing sword Insignia before casting a hard-hitting spell like Dragon ma particularly if you were buffed with golden vow or flame gramy strength next up we'll take a look at the envoy's horn the envoy horn shares the default attack of other Hammers and Deals physical and holy damage it's the third lightest hammer in Elden ring Wang 4 and requires 10 strength 12 dexterity and 16 f in order to use the envoy horn is an interesting Hammer it's one of the shorter hammers in Elden ring you can't find it until later in the game fully damage isn't a particularly great damage type in the base game and oracular bubble does 100% holy damage however it does have decent attack rating and only onethird of its normal attack damage is Holy making it very usable against Holy resistant enemies its weapon skill oracular bubble is why the envoy horn is a decent weapon it shoots out a bubble of 100% holy damage over a moderate distance distance that deals significant damage for its cost of 6 FP this allows you to use this to pick off enemies fairly easily or soften up hard to kill Target safely at range and because oracular bubble deals 100% holy damage it's buffed easily by holy shrouding crack tier and sacred scorpion charm for further damage additionally wearing the envoy Crown will further boost the damage of this skill The Sweet Spot for this weapon is at about 40 strength 40 dexterity and 20 Faith but the weapon skills decently with strength and dexterity up to 55 or so with faith lagging behind a bit however neither strength nor dexterity boost the damage of oracular bubble but fith does this means if you're building for oracular bubble damage you'll be sacrificing a bit of melee damage about 30 points but that's not too bad I highly recommend building this weapon that way increasing strength and Faith with minimum decks in order to one boost dracular bubble damage two allow you to use a great Shield effectively three take advantage of the claw Mark seal for incantations and four give you enough faith for Golden vow and other Buffs or spells you might want up next is the nox flowing Hammer the nox flowing Hammer shares the default attack of other Hammers and Deals physical damage it's the second heaviest hammer in Elden ring wing 6.5 and requires 17 strength and seven dexterity in order to use the nox flowing Hammer is the shortest hammer in Elden ring and you can't find it until fairly far into the game but it does have pretty high attack rating it scales with strength very well allowing for a great Shield pairing easily and its weapon skill flowing form is quite deadly flowing form swings the hammer and a mediumish wide sweep that tends to cause enemies to Flinch before pancaking them into the dirt this allows you to chain it over and over not allowing the enemy a chance to respond if you can land the first hit a lot of the time provided you have the stamina to keep using it its damage is also passable for its 16 FP cost and it will trigger winged sword Insignia rotten winged sword Insignia and melison prothesis if it hits multiple enemies attribute wise The Sweet Spot is right around 55 strength and minimum dexterity but it scales well up to 80 strength you can continue to pump decks after this for marginal damage allowing you to take this weapon into Journey too effectively but past that its damage will suffer however this might not matter if you stun lock everything with flowing form I like to play this weapon with a great Shield to block counter this allows you to use something like Assassin celan dagger to help offset FP cost if you want and you can use Warrior jar Shard or Shard of Alexander to further boost flowing form damage I also like to use ritual sword Talisman for this build as you tend to not get hit very often when using this weapon skill up next is the ringed finger the ringed finger shares the default attack of other Hammers and Deals physical damage it has an average weight for Hammer Nel and ring weighing 4.5 and requires 15 strength and nine dexterity in order to use the ringed finger isn't found until pretty far into the game but it is tied with the hammer and scepter of all knowing for the longest hammer and Elden ring it scales well with strength allowing for easy great Shield pairing and its weapon skill is pretty solid cloth lick expands the finger for a second or so before flicking the enemy forward often launching them into the air if it doesn't outright kill them the D damage it deals is decent for its 14 FP cost and can be used somewhat easily even at short range because it causes enemies to Flinch when it expands preventing damage a lot of the time I like to use this right after a block counter since claw flick also does 30 stance damage allowing you to stance break more difficult enemies easily with this combo The Sweet Spot for this weapon is around 55 strength and a minimum requirements into dexterity but it scales well up to 80 strength you can get some damage out of decks but it's not a ton making this weapon do all right in Journey 2 but proba not further than that unless you go for stance breaks I like to play this weapon with a great Shield to block counter which allows you to use something like Assassin Cilan dagger to help offset FP costs again Warrior jar Shard and Char of Alexander further boost cloth fck damage to make sure you have those and also make sure you have at least 51 PO on your armor so that if you get hit while using cloth flick you don't get interrupted the scepter of all knowing has unique thrusting variants on some of its weapon attacks and Deals physical and Magic damage it has an average weight for a hammer and Elden ring weighing 4 .5 and requires 12 strength 18 dexterity and 21 intelligence in order to wield even though the scepter of all knowing is tied for the longest hammer in Elden ring and it's the only unique Hammer that has a thrusting variant you still cannot use it until very late into the game and it has high requirements for hammer and its weapon skill is not very good knowledge above all debuffs nearby enemies and yourself reducing magic and hoing negation by 10% for 60 seconds for a whopping 35 FP to use since the weapon itself deals about 40% magic damage that's only a 5% increase to melee attacks making it better suited to debuff bosses or a large group of enemies before spell casting however considering its rather short range and cost you'd likely be better off just casting another spell for 35 FP most of the time The Sweet Spot for this weapon is around 50 decks and minimum requirements in strength and intelligence but intelligence does not scale terribly up to 50 and you can get some points out of strength as well which you might want to in order to use a better Shield however I find that the damage you lose from pump int instead of decks isn't too bad which allows you to use better staves and cast sorceries with higher potency this weapon should be fine damage wise at least through Journey 2 but it might struggle beyond that mostly because of its poor weapon skill consider using this weapon with a staff in order to cast sorceries using the scepter only to debuff or melee when necessary you can use the shield as well to get some block counters for one-on-one situations and when paired with great blade failings you can get some easy stance breaks and then we come to the last unique Hammer America's Hammer America's Hammer shares the default attack of other Hammers and Deals physical and holy damage it's one of the heavier hammers in El ring wng six and requires 20 strength 12 dexterity and 19 faith in order to use America's Hammer is one of the shorter hammers in Elden ring you can't find it until the very end of the game making it a journey to weapon it has high requirements for a hammer and it does some holy damage which many base game bosses are resistant to however it has the highest attack rating of all unique hammers most of the damage is physical and it has one of the deadliest weapons skills in Elden ring gold breaker causes your character to Leap Forward into the air slamming your hammer down in a rather large AOE dealing both physical and holy damage that tends to make enemies Flinch what makes this skill so great is two things first if you make it into the air you're virtually uninterruptible allowing you to spam this skill rather easily since enemies Flinch when struck most of the time giving you time to use it back to back and second if you connect with both the hammer itself and the AOE you will deal 40 stance damage allowing you to stand break the majority of bosses in N ring in two hits with a bit of practice and a little luck The Sweet Spot for this weapon is around 50 strength with minimum requirements in dexterity and Faith however it's a good idea to make sure you have at least 25 faith in order to use Golden vow and Flame grant me strength this weapon skills decently with all three stats though and since its skill is so good you'll be able to get through at least journey two and three and possibly higher than that with it I like to play this weapon with the great shield for Block counters and the claw Mark seal to take advantage of both strength and Faith for encant leaning into gold breaker like I did in my gold breaker bill so next up are the infusible hammers starting with the club the club has an R1 attack chain that operates just like the stone Club striking rapidly and Deals physical damage and has an average weight for a hammer down ring wing five and requires 10 strength in order to use the club is longer than most hammers in Elden ring it can be found extremely early in the game it has the lowest stat requirements of all Hammers and it attacks very quickly compared to other hammers however it does have the lowest attack rating of all infusible hammers its weapon scale barbaric Roar is not bad and further increases the physical damage you do with the weapon as well as strength scaling for 40 seconds and changes your heavy attacks into a chain this attack chain is very strong but you do need good Poise in order to pull it off successfully infusion wise sacred INF flame art and fire and lightning are virtually tied at 601 and 600 attack rating with magic pulling up third and 596 heavy edges out Keen 560 to 539 with cold being a valid option at 550 I like to play this with weapon with the highest attack rating I can since it's low to begin with so I usually go with fire this provides good strength scaling that helps you also use a great shield for Block counters you can pick any Ash of War you like but two good ones for this build are flaming strike for extra damage or Lion's claw for stance breaks Lion's claw does 39 stance damage with hammers Which is higher than all great weapons and colossal weapons that are not also hammers remember that this weapon attacks very quickly for Hammer so using talismans like winged sword Insignia or melison prosthesis are definitely viable on this weap next is the curved Club the curved Club shares the default attack of other Hammers and Deals physical damage and has an average weight for a hammer and L ring weighing five and requires 11 strength and seven dexterity in order to use on initial inspection the curved Club doesn't look that great it is one of the shorter hammers in El ring and it has lower attack rating than a lot of other infusible hammers however you can get it early on in the game and it has rather good strength scaling making it ideal to use with a great shield and just like the club it has the weapon skill barbaric Roar which is not a bad choice as as long as you have decent Poise infusion wise magic comes in first at 656 attack rating with sacred inflame art second at 638 and fire and lightning a close third at 634 however heavy is not that far behind at 620 outperforming Keen by 45 points I like to use this weapon with a heavy infusion since it's not that far behind the top three and allows you to buff the weapon with barbaric Roar more effectively by keeping the weapon all physical damage but also allows you to use a great Shield pretty easily with it and if you don't use barbaric Roar you can always buff your weapon with a gree as well pushing you over the other infusions and damage when you need it most up next is the spiked club the spike Club has a unique R2 attack and Deals physical damage it has an average weight for a hammer now ring Wang five and requires 12 strength and seven dexterity in order to use the spike Club is one of three hammers with Native bleed buildup on it it can be found extremely early on in the game and it is actually decent quality scaling that makes it great for a journey to play through however it is one of the shorter hammers in El ring and you don't trigger Hammer nearly as often as you'd hope when using weapon it also has the weapon skill barbaric Roar which is not bad again as long as you have Poise but it's particularly good on this weapon because of the bleed buildup that can often trigger from the attack chain that changes when buffing with this F of War infusion wise sacred and Flame art come in first at 675 with magic just behind at 673 and fire and lightning just behind that at 670 heavy outperforms Keen 604 to 576 with cold doing 593 however quality comes in here at 573 which is not that far behind either ke or heavy meaning it should easily overtake either of these infusions in Journey 2 where you can take strength and dexterity up to 8080 with better results because fire is pretty far ahead of heavy in terms of attack rating I recommend taking this infusion here in order to take advantage of that and still use a great Shield easily due to strength scaling you could also go the cold route if you want to have Duo status effects because cold also scales well with strength up next is the stone Club the stone Club has an R1 attack chain that operates just like the club striking rapidly and Deals physical damage it is the heaviest hammer in El ring wing 7 and requires 16 strength and eight dexterity in order to use the stone Club slaps hard and should be considered by any player looking to use a hammer in El ring it's one of the longest hammers it can be found somewhat early in the game it attacks more quickly than most other Hammers and it has the highest potential attack rating of all hammers in the game the only drawbacks are that it is the heaviest Hammer weighing seven and kick is not a great weapon skill in PVE kick is not particularly good since it's used to open up Shield wielding enemies and players to critical attacks by breaking their guard however there are not that many enemies that this applies to and usually you can just wait for those enemies to attack you and block counter so I highly recommend swapping this to another weapon skill when you can't infusion wise fire and lightning comes in first at 718 attack rating with magic a close second at 714 and sacred INF flame art coming in at 685 heavy outperforms Keen 660 to 641 and cold actually outperforms heavy making it a good choice since it still has good strength scaling and you can attack quickly with this weapon and triggering Frostbite fast in many cases I like to play this weapon with very high attack rating with flaming strike in the fire infusion because you can hit close to 900 attack rating when set up this way with ritual sword Talisman which is very high for a weapon that weighs seven Additionally you could use the jellyfish Shield to further buff your damage while also using block counters up next is the mace the mace has a unique R2 attack and Deals physical damage it has an average weight for a hammer and elen ring weighing 4.5 and requires 12 strength and seven dexterity in order to use the mace is neither a fantastic weapon nor a poor one it's one of the shorter hammers in L ring but you can purchase it in Round Table hold early on and it has decent attack reading as with a stone Club kick is not a particularly good weapon skill so I highly recommend swapping this to another one when you can any of the ones I've mentioned so far are fine infusion wise sacred and Flame art comes in first at 660 with magic virtually tied at 658 and fire and lightning just behind at 654 heavy outperforms ke 609 to 587 with gold coming in at 5.99 I like to play this weapon with a sacred or flame AR infusions in a great Shield to get that traditional Paladin feeling you can split attributes between strength and Faith to use a great shield and the claw Mark seal to cast spells like golden vow which really helps you to crank up your damage I also really like the lightning SL as of War for this weapon since it does have sacred as an infusion option and still Buffs the weapon and you can also use it easily after a stance break or sometimes after a block en counter next up is the Morning Star the Morning Star shares a thrusting attack at the end of its R1 attack change as well as a rolling R1 with the scepter of all knowing deals physical damage it has an average weight for a hammer and L ring weing five and requires 12 strength and eight dexterity in order to use the Morning Star is not the most powerful hammer in ring and it's quite short but it does have bleed buildup on hit and it can be found quite early and it's a decent quality scaling weapon making it good for Journey 2 as with the stone club and mace kick is not a particularly good weapon skill so I highly recommend swapping this to another one when you can any of the ones I suggested so far are good infusion wise magic and sacred and Flame art are tied at 662 attack rating with fire and lightning cominging second he outperforms heavy with this Hammer but only by three attack rating and cold is just behind at 566 quality is not far behind that either at 564 I like to play this weapon with the heavy infusion dipping a few points into faith in Arcane in order to use blood flame Blade with it or just use blood grease otherwise you don't see much result from the bleed effect which normally only triggers maybe once per Vos fite this also allows you to crank strength and use a great Shield as well for Block counters next is the warpick the warpick shares that fa attack of other Hammers and Deals physical damage it's the second lightest hammer in elen ring wing 2.5 and requires 11 strength and nine dexterity in order to use the warpick is an interesting Hammer because it's extremely lightweight at 2.5 it does piercing damage instead of strike despite what the weapon displays and it can be found early in the game the biggest downside and it's a big one is that it has very low attack rating for Hammer second only to various bouquet as with the stone Club mace and Morning Star Kick is not a particularly good weapon skill so replace it as soon as you can infusion wise magic and sacred and Flame art are tied at 599 attack rating with fire and lightning coming in at 585 Keen out performs heavy by six points with cold just behind at 509 I like to play this weapon with the blood infusion since its attack rating is so low anyway which allows you to make up for it somewhat by triggering Hemorrhage on enemies and bosses and you can use things like white mask and Lord of blood's exaltation to further boost attack power as well use a great shield for Block counters and make sure to use an ash of war with good stance damage like Lion's claw since this can help make up for the weapons attack rating up next is the hammer the hammer shares the default attack of other Hammers and Deals physical damage it's the second heaviest hammer in elen ring wing 6.5 and requires 14 strength and seven dexterity in order to use the hammer is a solid choice for this weapon group because of its very high attack rating and the fact that it is the second longest Hammer now ring however you cannot get it until very late into the game in the Royal capital and it's missable so you're much more likely that you'll use something else by the time you can get this one again kick is not a particularly good weapon skill so I highly recommend swapping this out with another one infusion wise fire and lightning comes in first at 692 attack rating with magic just behind at 689 and sacred and Flame art at 671 heavy outperforms Keen 634 to 66 with cold outperforming heavy at 643 making it a good choice for this weapon I like to use this weapon with fire or cold for good strength scaling and pair it with a great Shield liance Claw is just so easy to use with it and it absolutely destroys enemies because of the decent damage and stance damage for use however odds are you will likely be using another Hammer unless it's in Journey 2 because that's how late into the game you get it and the last infusible Hammer is the monks flame mace the mon flame mace has a unique R2 attack that Stomps the ground and Deals physical damage it's one of the heavier hammers in El ring weighing six and requires 13 strength and 13 dexterity in order to use the monks flame mace has solid attack rating for a hammer it can be found pretty early in Elden ring and it has great Keen scaling if you want a good dexterity option for a hammer and again kick is not a particularly good weapon skill on it so I highly recommend replacing it as soon as you can infusion wise magic comes in first at 685 attack rating then fire and lightning at 682 and finally sacred and Flame art at 664 Heen out performs heavy by whopping 43 points with cold at 614 attack rating I like to lean into the Keen aspect of this weapon when using it though it can make it challenging to use a great Shield when you have low strength however the jellyfish Shield is fantastic since it only requires 20 strength to use and it can buff your damage when paired with the crack blade Ash of War you not only get nearly 1,000 attack rating when buffed but you also get over 40 stance damage with each char charged heavy attack allowing you to stance break most bosses with one block counter and a Charged heavy attack or two charged heavy attacks C blade is just an all-around fantastic Ash of War for hammers because it pushes them over that 40 charged heavy attack threshold for stance damage which allows you to stagger most bosses and two hits with any Hammer so that wraps up our video for Hammers and Elden ring I hope you guys learned some things in this video I really like this weapon group when doing this video it's not a weapon group that I anticipated liking but the more I played with it the more I really really enjoy Hammers and I think they a very overlooked weapon type in this game so what did I miss make sure you guys share your tips in the comments below and if you have questions please leave them here and I'll try and answer them as soon as I can I will be trying to wrap up these videos before we get into the shadow of the earth tree DLC we also have more El content just around the [Music] [Music] corner w

Title: GREAT HAMMERS are the BEST Weapon in Elden Ring - Elden Ring ALL Great Hammers Breakdown
Video ID: PFDndCXxbUI
Transcript Text:
in this Elden ring video I'm going to be showing you why great hammers are the best weapon in Elden ring this is the 20th video in a series of videos where we showcase each weapon from a given weapon category in Elden ring and go through the pros and cons of that weapon to help you make better decisions about whether you want to use that weapon or not in your bill but first before we get into the great hammers themselves let's take a look at the pros and cons of this weapon group as well as the play styles that I think most people who use great hammers will be using so starting with the pros of great hammers first the first thing is quite obvious this weapon type has the highest stance damage of any weapon type in the game except for colossal weapons that are also hammers so if you're trying to do stance breaks on enemies this is one of the if not the easiest weapon type to do this with and there are certain ashes of war and weapon skills in the game that will actually do more stance damage when using this weapon type if you use them making it very very good for this play style a lot of these weapons can be acquired quite easily and early on in the game or at least in the first half giving you a broad selection of great hammers to use compared to some other weapons in the game the two-handed light attacks of great hammers is actually faster than you would think and it allows you to kind of make enemies Flinch by hitting them repeatedly and also build up stance damage on them and I think it's much faster than you would initially realize if you were looking at this weapon type and lastly strike damage is a useful damage type against some of the most annoying enemies in the game if you're fighting like the Gargoyles it's good damage type some of the enemies where you hit them and they're hard is so much your weapon normally rebuffs off of them like the crystallins stuff like that so there is a good place for strike damage in this game and great hammers do that damage type the cons of this weapon type are that even though it attacks faster with its two-handed move set than you would think it still attacks generally slower than many weapon types in the game and additionally only two great hammers have native status effect buildup on them out of the 14 so if you're trying to play a status effect build your options are kind of limited and lastly they tend to be somewhat heavy and even though they're not that heavy compared to some of the Colossal weapons in the game they are still heavier than the majority of weapons in the game making them particularly difficult to use early on and manage your weight without fat rolling so talking about the play styles that most people using great hammers will use I think there's really predominantly two ways people will play the first is simply just two-handing a great hammer and going to town with it predominantly because if you're playing it earlier on in the game this allows you to manage your weight more effectively and because a single charged Arch two from a great hammer will stagger most enemies and two of them will you know knock down most bosses and if you block counter you do very high stance damage as well so you could theoretically do a charge sh to block counter and knock down a boss most bosses so there isn't really a need to do anything else when that can be your strategy and the second way is just because there are a bunch of Faith scaling great hammers in this game particularly the unique ones pairing it with a sacred seal and buffing yourself or using something like the claw Mark seal and pumping strength and faith and throwing incantations while also two-handing a great hammer makes a lot of sense you could use a great shield with a great hammer if you want the problem with that is that it takes a lot of endurance in order to use both of these things and not fat roll all over the place if you have decent armor so it's very very difficult to do so I think most people are just going to play with one single weapon or a single weapon and a sacred seal so those things out of the way let's take a look at the unique great hammers first and the first one up is the envoy Longhorn the envoy Longhorn shares the default move set of most great Hammers and Deals physical and holy damage it has an average weight for a great hammer in ring wing 9.5 and requires 22 Strength 11 dexterity and 18 faith in order to use effectively the envoy Longhorn is a decent grade Hammer it's one of the longer grade hammers in Elden ring and its weapon skill bubble shower deals a metric ton of damage however you won't get it until pretty far into the game and holy damage is resisted by many tough bosses and it can take a long time to farm this weapon bubble shower deals 100% holy damage allowing you to buff it easily with sacred scorpion charm and holy shroud and crack tier as well as using something like Warrior jar Shard or Shard of Alexander note that the envoy Crown helmet will also buff the damage of this weapon skill so consider using it if you're using this weapon and keep in mind that this weapon skill does 902 stance damage if all bubbles hit your target which is very hard to do but still that is a staggering amount of stance damage bubble shower can one shot tough to kill enemies and make short work of bosses but it can be difficult to use because of its somewhat long windup and short range this makes using it in succession risky since you'll likely be hit because you need to be pretty close to ensure that the bubbles hit the target however if you do stance break an enemy you can use this point blank into them for lots of damage and keep in mind you can use the carry and filigreed Crest in order to reduce the cost of this skill from 16 to 12 which makes it easier to use the sweet spot for this weapon is about 50 strength 50 faith and 50 dexterity which you won't reach until New Game Plus making this an excellent journey to weapon however strength and Faith do scale better than dexterity with faith slightly outperforming strength by a very small amount and Faith does affect bubble shower damage while strength and dexterity do not I recommend two-handing this weapon and pumping strength and faith and using it with a claw Mark seal to cast incantations effectively there is no need to use a great shield with this weapon but you can if you really insist next up is the cranial vessel candlestick the cranial vessel Candlestick shares the default move set of most great Hammers and Deals physical and fire damage it's tied for the heaviest great hammer in Elden ring wi 12.5 and requires 26 strength eight dexterity and 22 faith in order to use effectively the cranial vessel Candlestick is a phenomenal grade Hammer it's the second longest grade hammer in Elden ring it has very high attack rating for a grade hammer and its weapon skill surge of Faith deals a ton of damage if you can land it however it is tied for the heaviest gr hammer and you cannot find it until close till the end of the game surge of Faith deals a lot of fire damage in an AOE around you that has a somewhat small radius and then Reigns Fireballs down from the sky and you can continue to reain them down with repeated inputs but the AOE is only produced on the first input and is the vast majority of the damage of this weapon skill since Serge of Faith deals 100% fire damage you can buff it easily with fire scorpion charm and fire shrot and crack tier as well as Warrior jar Shard or Shard of Alexander The Sweet Spot for this weapon is around 50 strength and 50 Faith with faith outperforming strength by a small amount dexterity doesn't scale well with this weapon so you'll likely continue to increase faith and strength into New Game Plus note that Faith increases surge of Faith damage and that strength and dexterity do not I recommend two-handing this weapon and pumping strength and faith and using it with a clawar seal to cast incantations effectively and this weapon makes a great candidate for flame granty strength since it deals both physical and fire damage you can reach nearly 1,600 attack rating when fully buffed while two-handing with this weapon up next is the Beast claw great hammer the Beast claw grade Hammer shares the default move set of most grade Hammers and Deals physical and holy damage it's one of the lightest grade hammers in El ring wing nine and requires 20 strength 10 dexterity and 18 faith in order to use effectively the beastclaw great hammer might be my favorite great hammer in Elden rank despite lower attack rating than many great hammers the fact that it does some holy damage and despite the fact you can't get it till very far into the game I just love its weapon skill regle Beast claw which does 100% physical damage and I appreciate that strength dexterity and Faith all increase Regal be Beast claw damage Regal Beast claw does a cone-shaped AOE not unlike the Beast claw incantation but it does more damage and it does hit in a wider cone though the claws don't travel as far as its spell counterpart the damage Regal Beast claw deals is somewhat modest but it's nearly impossible not to hit the target with it and because it Deals Only physical damage you can boost its damage with flame grant me strength effectively The Sweet Spot for this weapon is around 50 strength and 50 dexterity with minimum requirements and Faith however since you have 18 faith in order to use this weapon effectively anyway you might as well take it up to 25 in order to use Golden vow and Flame gramy strength I suggest taking Faith up to 50 after strength and dexterity and then continuing with strength and dexterity and New Game Plus and as I mentioned all three of these stats increase the damage of Regal Beast claw I like to twoand this weapon only using a seal for the buffing spells I mentioned leading into the ash of war and using Warrior jar Shard or Shard of Alexander to increase its damage further consider using carry and filigreed Crest to reduce its FP cost from 20 to 15 as well and the last unique gr Hammer is the devour receptor the devour receptor shares the default move set of most great Hammers and Deals physical and fire damage it's one of the heaviest gr hammers in Elden ring Wang 11.5 and requires 24 strength 20 dexterity and 25 faith in order to use effectively the devour scepter might be the longest great hammer in Elden ring and you might be able to acquire it rather early on but it's certainly not the best great hammer not only is it very heavy and has the highest stat requirements of all great hammers but its weapon skill costs a ton of FP and does very poor damage devour of Worlds does 100% fire damage in a mediumish AOE and heals you for 15% of your max HP for each enemy hit which sounds great right well it does very poor damage and I mean very poor and because it costs 35 FP you can't use it very often even when optimized to get the most out of this weapon skill buffed with flame grant me strength golden vow fire shroud and crack tier Shard of Alexander fire scorpion charm and ritual sword Talisman I could not break 1K damage on any enemy hit however it's not bad if you're using mimic tier as it keeps them alive easily The Sweet Spot for this weapon is at 50 strength and 50 dexterity with minimum points in faith which happens to be 25 allowing you to cast flame granty strength and golden F this makes this weapon more of a quality weapon than a strength Faith weapon like some of the previous unique great Hammers and only Faith boosts the damage of devour of Worlds making things worse I highly recommend using a seal to buff with flame grant me strength and golden vow especially since this weapon does both fire and physical damage and leaning into two-handing this weapon with jump attacks and the claw Talisman for more damage however another great option is to use it with the great shield and use some sort of ashore on that great Shield that you prefer since the one on this weapon is pretty bad or you could use something like the jellyfish Shield to further boost your damage when attacking with this weapon and this brings us to the infusible great Hammers and Elden ring and first up is the large Club the large Club shares the default move set of most great Hammers and Deals physical damage it's tied for lightest great hammer in Elden ring wing 8.5 and requires 22 strength in order to use effectively the large Club is a good option for those wanting to use a great hammer right away since you can acquire it in the first 5 minutes of the game in Lim grave it's also tied for the lightest gr hammer in elen ring and makes it easier to use early on and it's the third longest grade Hammer the downside is that its attack rating is rather low for a great hammer barbaric Roar is not a terrible Ash of war and changes the charged heavy attack of the weapon into a combo that can be used quite effectively while also boosting physical damage and strength scaling it's not the greatest Ash of War since you need good poison protection as you typically trade damage but there are worse out there I suggest changing this when you can to something like storm collar stamp upward cut stamp sweep or Lion's claw both stamp upward cut and Lion's claw do 42 stance damage when used with great hammers allowing you to stance break many bosses in two hits infusion wise fire and lightning and Magic are virtually tied for highest attack rating with sacred and Flame art coming in second heavy is a bit behind that and cold is not far behind heavy stamp sweep works well with the blood infusion so consider it if you want to take advantage of hemorrhage you can either twoand this weapon or use it with a great Shield when you get one though you can still block counter with this weapon in a pinch up next is the curved grade Club the curved grade Club shares the default move set of most great Hammers and Deals physical damage it has an average weight for a great hammer n in ring wing 10 and requires 24 strength and 10 dexterity in order to use effectively the curved great Club is the pound-for-pound King of infusible Great hammers it has the highest attack back riding of them all except when set to heavier or cold and you can acquire it pretty early on by farming and learning of the lakes and it's one of the longer great hammers in elen ring and what's amazing is it's not even the heaviest great hammer like the large Club this weapon also comes with barbaric Roar which you can leave on it or you can change for something else I really like flaming strike on this weapon because it has the highest flame Art Attack rating of all infusible gr hammers allowing you to make Solid Faith build with it and two-handed only for 16 strength infusion wise fire and lightning is in first place with 819 attack rating with magic in second at 799 and sacred and Flame art coming in third at 792 heavy and cold are much further behind and I recommend using a different grade Hammer if you like these infusions as there are several that have SC scaling in strength I like to twoam this weapon with a sacred seal setting it to the flame art or sacred infusion meeting the 16th strength in order to twoand it and then cranking Faith Skyhigh in order to be able to cast incantations with her tree seal and still have fantastic melee damage with a weapon that also has very good stance damage up next is the great mace the great mace shares the default move set of most great Hammers and Deals physical damage it's one of the heaviest great hammers in El ring wing 11.5 and requires 28 points in strength in order to use effectively the great mace slaps hard and is an excellent great hammer it has very high attack rating for a great hammer it's longer than most other great Hammers and you can find it reasonably quickly if you know where to go and it has fantastic heavy scaling the only downside is that it's pretty heavy for a great hammer endure is an excellent weapon skill that increases your damage absorption by 45% and increases your Poise for 3 seconds allowing you to tank damage and not be interrupted while you take advantage of great hammer charged heavy attacks that can stance break most bosses in two hits you can however change it to another if you wish infusion wise fire and lightning and Magic are virtually tied for highest attack rating with sacred inflame aren't coming in second though heavy is not far behind thanks to the weapon's fantastic heavy scaling gold is also pretty good at 738 attack rating like other grade hammers you don't really need to do anything but two-hand weapon to get the most out of it using endure when you need to stance break a tough enemy and relying on jump attacks where R once as needed or you can swap to a more offensive Ash of War then use that instead but you will still play somewhat similarly up next is the pickaxe the pickaxe has a unique overhead heavy attack similar to The Great Club which is a colossal weapon and Deals physical damage it has an average weight for a great hammer in elen ring weighing 10 and requires 22 strength and 10 exterity in order to use effectively the pickaxe is an interesting great hammer that functions more like a great axx than a great hammer and in fact cannot be power stamped with other great hammers only other great axes it also does Pierce damage much like the Rusted anchor allowing it to deal counter damage as well as take advantage of the spear Talman to further boost counter damage you can Farm it from Miners and limb grave tunnel very early on in the game and the overal negative is that it's kind of short for a great hammer Endor is not a bad weapon skill and you can certainly use it with this weapon or you can change it for something else depending on what you like infusion wise fire and lightning comes in first at 79 94 with magic at 783 and sacred inflame art in third at 770 heavy is not bad at 723 and cold is 690 this puts it in the middle of the pack damage wise I like to dual wield this weapon with a rusted anger using jump attacks and L1 chains to destroy enemies taking advantage of counter damage when enemies are attacking use the spear and Claw talismans and make sure to have good Poise so you aren't interrupted additionally set your infusion to heavy to get the most from the spear Talisman since it only boosts physical counter damage next we come to the brick Hammer the brick Hammer shares the default move set of most great Hammers and Deals physical damage it's tied for the heaviest great hammer in Elden ring wi 12.5 and requires 31 points in strength in order to use effectively the brick Hammer hits like an absolute truck it not only has the second highest attack rating of all infusible great Hammers and phenomenal strength scaling you can find it very early on in storm Vil Castle making it a great choice for would be great hammer users the only negatives are that it's the second shortest great hammer and also the heaviest barbaric roar's weapon skill Buffs physical damage and strength scaling while also changing the charged heavy attack of the weapon to an attack chain for 40 seconds you can further boost the charged heavy attack damage of this Chain by equipping the roar Medallion Highland axe in your off hand and by using the spiked crack tier this is not a bad weapon skill especially using the heavy infusion but you could also use stamp upward cut stamp sweep or Lion's claw infusion wise fire en lightning comes in first at a huge 89 attack rating with magic behind and second at 782 and sacred and Flame art in third at 777 heavy performs very well though at 757 and cold is just behind at 740 making it a valid option I like to twoand this weapon using jump attacks charged heavy attacks and whatever weapon skill that you decide to use up next is the battle Hammer the battle Hammer shares the default move set of most gr Hammers and Deals physical damage it has an average weight for a gr hammer neld in ring wing 10 and requires 26 strength and eight dexterity in order to use effectively the attack rating of the battle Hammer is unquestionably solid and it has fantastic strength scaling however it's probably unlikely you will use this weapon if you're using a great hammer and that's because it's not only the shortest hammer in Elden ring but also because the earliest you can get it is in the lendell Royal Capital which is quite far into the game and it can take some time to farm it you'll likely have a better great hammer that's already upgraded by this point brager's Roar is not a bad weapon skill and boosts physical damage by 10% adds 10% damage negation to all types and boost stamina recovery by about 20% it also changes your charged heavy attack into running powerful attack that is identical to war cry you can further boost the charged heavy attack damage in the same ways the brick Hammer can however you might want to swap it if you don't like this weapon skill infusion wise magic and fire and lightninging are virtually tied for highest attack rating with sacred inflame art coming in second heavy is not bad as I mentioned and cold is just behind heavy as another viable option I recommend two anding this weapon and using a weapon skill like Lion's claw if you insist on using this weapon next we come to the rotten battle Hammer the the rotten battle Hammer shares the default move set of most gr Hammers and Deals physical damage it has an average weight for a gr hammer in Elden ring weighing 10 and requires 26 strength and eight dexterity in order to use effectively the rotten battle Hammer is nearly identical to the battle hammer in every way except that it does about 5% less damage and has Scarlet rot buildup on hit however you can't find this weapon until even further in Ellen ring in the consecrated snowfield making it practically a new game plus weapon I like to use this weapon with either the poison Mist weapon skill with the blood infusion in order to be able to set Scarlet rot Hemorrhage and poison while buffed with poison mist or you can use something like storm collar with either poison or blood infusions to hit rapidly triggering these status effects consider using Lord of blood's exaltation and Kindred of rots exaltation with this weapon for increased attack power and or the white mask or Mushroom Crown next we come to the celebran skull the celebran skull shares the default move set of most great Hammers and Deals physical damage it is tied for the lightest great hammer in Elden ring wi 8.5 and requires 18 strength and 12 dexterity in order to use effectively the celebran skull might not seem like a good weapon it has lower attack rating than many great hammers it's quite short for a great hammer and you cannot find it until Altus Plateau however it is tied for the lightest grade hammer and it grants 20 runes per hit and has extremely low requirements barbaric Roar is not a bad weapon skill but because this weapon is both short and Deals less damage than most great hammers I like to use something like Lion's claw and lean into the stance damage of the weapon infusion wise fire and lightning comes in first at 777 with magic and second at at 758 and sacred inflame art and a close third at 750 I like to use fire to get the highest attack rating possible with this weapon and still maintain decent strength scaling in order to use a great Shield I like to pair this weapon with a great shield for Block counters which is much easier to do because it's so light compared to other great hammers this allows you to use a lion's claw and block counter to stance break bosses quickly and play somewhat similarly to my tower Knight Bill up next is great Stars the great star shares the default move set of most great Hammers and Deals physical damage it has an average weight for a great hammer n ring Wang 10 and requires 22 strength and 12 dexterity in order to use effectively the great stars is a fan favorite for a reason and that's because it's the only great hammer with Native bleed buildup and it also heals 1% Max HP per hit with the weapon otherwise though it's damages in the middle of the pack for great hammers as it its length and you cannot find it until Altus Plateau which might take you a while to get to Endor is not a bad weapon skill but I prefer something that hits more rapidly to take advantage of both the bleed buildup and healing per hit storm collar is a great choice for this as is pret charge infusion wise fire and lightning take the top spot at 779 with magic at 765 and sacred inflame art at 753 heavy is at 723 with a Colt aways behind at 655 but much higher than blood and poison which is 570 this makes a colt a decent alternative to blood if you want higher bleed buildup but don't want to sacrifice quite as much attack rating I like to use this weapon with the ultt scaling and storm CER to trigger Hemorrhage on hard to kill enemies and bosses also healing you at the same time make sure you have high Poise so you're not interrupted and use things like Lord of blood's exaltation and rotten Wing sword Insignia to boost attack power further note that you can also use the dragon communion seal to cast spells if you are set up this way and you can drop some points into Faith but it is a rather difficult stat spread needing strength endurance Faith Arcane and some mind and lastly we come to the Great Horn Hammer the Great Horn Hammer shares the default move set of most great Hammers and Deals physical damage as an average weight for a great hammer now ring wi 10 and requires 22 strength and 10 dexterity in order to use effectively the Great Horn Hammer is a vastly underrated weapon although its damage and length are in the middle of the pack for GR hammers it can be farmed pretty early in the game and the 3% Max HP healing per kill can be invaluable early on and since you usually kill things in one or two hits with it it typically performs better than great stars in terms of healing while exploring the world of Elden ring barbaric Roar is not a bad weapon skill so you can use this or any other weapon skill you like I like Royal Knights resolver determination for easy kills the chump attack or charged heavy attacks infusion wise fire and lightning comes in first at 789 with magic at 776 and sacred and Flame art just behind at 775 heavy is not bad at 726 but cold actually has no intelligence scaling with this weapon for some reason so I don't recommend selecting that infusion as quality actually outperforms it in terms of attack rating I like to play this weapon as a mage build using the magic infusion and cranking intelligence you can two-hand this weapon somewhat easily with 15 strength but 22 strength is not a lot in order to be able to single-hand it either this allows you to cast spells effectively while still maintaining High melee damage and you can take advantage of ritual sword Talisman easily since you still gain the HP back when killing enemies with spells if you use assassin suring dagger then you can get your FP back when you stance break enemies and then cast spells to get your HP back rinse and repeat so that wraps up our video on how great hammers are the best weapon in Elden ring I hope you guys enjoyed this video it's been a while since I've done one of these really really love the great hammer weapon class and I look forward to getting the rest of these wrapped up before the DLC you can expect a lot more Elden ring content in the near future what's your go-to great hammer did you learn something in this video let me know in the comments below

Title: Daggers are the Best Weapon in Elden Ring - Elden Ring All Daggers Breakdown
Video ID: dtceYKwElf0
Transcript Text:
in this Elden ring video I'm going to be showing you why daggers are the best weapon in Elden ring this is our 21st video in a series of videos about different weapons and the weapons inside their weapon groups kind of going through the pros and cons of each one of those weapons and helping you make better decisions about why or why not you might use that weapon in your build before we get into the weapons themselves however I want to talk a little bit about the pros and cons of the weapon group itself and the play Styles I think most people who are using daggers will use so let's get into the pros of daggers first and the first thing to know about daggers is they have a very fast attack speed compared to most other weapons in Elden ring so you're going to be able to hit enemies rapidly with this weapon particularly when dual wielding their dual wield move set is very very fast as well and it allows them to make good use of things like rotten Wing sword Insignia or millison thosis in order to build up your attack power rapidly another thing daggers have going for them is their critical rating they typically have higher critical rating than most weapons in the game most daggers have 100 0 or higher critical rating although there are a handful of ones that are only 100 which is pretty typical for weapons in Elden ring which allows them to get more critical damage than a lot of other weapon groups so if you find yourself doing you know critical attacks particularly backstabs with this weapon cuz block counters are not very effective at breaking an enemy stance in order to get you to do a critical attack so you're probably talking about in this case either pairing or doing backstabs and the last Pro of this weapon group is that they're extremely lightweight with the heaviest dagger wing three in the latest wag 1.5 which allows you to pack an extra dagger with you for no problem or to make a dagger build and manage your equip weight very very easily the negatives of this weapon type are that they have just about lower attack rating than any other weapon in the game so you're not going to deal a ton of damage per hit even though you can attack quickly with them which kind of makes up for that and that dual wielding used to be a great way for this weapon group to set status effects but because that was nerfed a few patches ago they're not as good at setting status effects as they once wore with their dual wield move set and lastly this weapon type has extremely short reach compared to any other weapon in Elden ring which makes it so that you can miss attacks more easily particularly when dual wielding when you're pressed up up against the body of a weird shaped enemy sometimes your attacks will just not hit them the play Styles I think most people will use when using a dagger and Elden ring are basically dual wielding in order to get rapid attacks and set some status effects even if it takes longer than it used to and to build up their attack power using things like rot Wing sword andette Etc or they might use them as a backup for like a critical build where like you know they have a longer reaching weapon and then when they stance break something they might pull out a dagger and go in for a Critical Strike that's typically you know you're not normally going to see someone do a Parry build with only a dagger they might use something else like a Rapier or something like that but you might have a build that does stance breaks regularly and you want to just swap to a dagger real quick to go in for a critical attack those are the ways I see most people using them there's obviously other ways but I think those are the primary two ways people play daggers and elen ring so let's get into the unique daggers first before we get into the infusible ones and the first one is the Scorpion's Stinger the Scorpion Stinger has a unique R2 attack shared with a miser cord and Glenstone Chris and Deals physical damage it has an average weight for dagger and Elden ring wing 2.5 and requires six strength and 12 dexterity in order to use effectively the Scorpion Stinger is the only dagger with Scarlet rot buildup and it's one of the longer daggers in Elden ring and it can deal slash or thrust damage effectively thanks to its thrusting heavy attack however you won't find this until late into the game in the lake of rock repeating thrust is a decent weapon skill especially since two uses of it is usually enough to set Scarlet rod on bosses and is faster than trying to set it while dual wielding daggers the downside is that daggers have a short range in general making it so you need to be very close to the Target to hit it easily with repeating thrust The Sweet Spot for this weapon is around minimum strength and 50 dexterity but the weapon scales well up to 80 dexterity where it drops off significantly strength does provide some damage but not a ton making this weapon better used on the first playthrough than a subsequent one however since you cannot get it until leat of the game you won't be able to do that unless someone drops you one I like to use this weapon as a means to set Scarlet rot as a backup weapon since it weighs very little or you can use it with the jellyfish Shield buffing your attack power with it leaning into the rapid attacks and high critical damage of daggers in general next we come to the Cadia the Sadia shares the default move set of most other daggers and Deals physical damage it's the heaviest dagger Nel ring wing 3.5 requires 10 strength and 10 dexterity in order to use effectively the Cadia can be found pretty quickly outside beastial sanctum and is one of the longest daggers in Elden ring has high attack rating for dagger and Buffs beastial incantations by 10% which Stacks with the sacred seal however it only has 100 crit rating which is lower than most other daggers Quick Step is an okay weapon skill especially since it can help position you for backstabs more easily you won't use it all the time though The Sweet Spot for this weapon is 50 strength and minimum Dex but scales well up to 80 strength and dexterity doesn't scale that poorly however this makes it a much better first playthrough weapon than a second playthrough weapon the Cadia is in a weird spot because you're either using it simply as a buff stick to cast beastial incantations and not using it for attacks at all or if you decide to build for damage you have to add points into faith in order to cast beastial incantations which lowers your overall attack rating of the weapon since it doesn't scale with faith Additionally you cannot buff this weapon with your incantations like you can other daggers and if you simply want to use it as a and not worry about its incantation buff you'll have high attack rating but you'll have poor critical damage making it sort of a bad trade unless you're dual building I'd either use this in a beastial incantation build splitting points between strength and faith and mailing with this weapon only as needed or using it in a dual wield dagger build that focuses on high damage per swing and doesn't worry about status effects up next is the Glenstone Chris the Glenstone chis shares a unique R2 attack with a misericord and Scorpion stinger and Deals physical and Magic damage damage it's tied for the lightest dagger Nel ring weighing 1.5 and requires five strength 12 dexterity and 16 intelligence in order to use effectively the Glenstone Cris might be my favorite dagger nelden ring at first glance there isn't a lot that separates this from other daggers and you can't find it until quite late into the game from doing a quest line but let me tell you why it's so good Glenstone Dart its weapon skill is similar to Glenstone Pebble in a lot of ways but there are some key differences Glenstone Dart does more damage than Glenstone Pebble when it comes to the projectile portion and not by a small amount additionally Glenstone Dart can Pierce enemies while Glenstone Pebble cannot though Glenstone Dart does cost two more fpdu per cast which I think is more than worth it however you can charge Glenstone Dart by holding L2 increasing its damage even further this gives you a deadly ranged option as well as a Quick Melee option without the need of any spells The Sweet Spot for this weapon is around 40 decks and 50 in but you can increase in higher instead of decks in order to use spells if you prefer reducing your melee damage by a very small amount additionally intelligence increases glint Stone Dart damage and Dex only increases the follow-up attack I like to use this weapon in a dual wield setup with another inex scaling dagger like the crystal knife using Glenstone Dart as needed when range is called for use Talisman like Shard of Alexander magic scorpion charm millison prosthesis and Godfree icon to further boost your Glenstone dark damage next up is the rubia the ruvia shares the default attack of most daggers and Deals physical damage it has an average weight for a dagger in ring weighing 2.5 and requires five strength 13 dexterity and 13 Arcane in order to use effectively ruvia is a fantastic dagger for those looking to take advantage of the Hemorrhage status effect and is probably the best dagger for it since the dual wield status effect Nerf you can also get this weapon very early on in limb grave allowing you to take advantage of it right away the only real downside being lower attack rating than many other unique daggers ruvia blood blade is an exceptional weapon skill that does 100% physical damage is relatively cheap and does Hemorrhage build up at range even though its damage is modest however when connecting with the blade and the projectile at the same time since patch 1.07 you get insane Hemorrhage buildup allowing you to trigger it in one hit many times or at most two times making the strategy for this weapon to range when necessary but generally get up close and spam this weapon skill The Sweet Spot for this weapon is around 55 Arcane with minimum points in decks but deck scales okay up to 50 Arcane will increase the Hemorrhage buildup though so you want to priortize this when leveling up I like to play this weapon with ruvia in one hand and the dragon communion seal in the other which will allow you to cast some spells effectively while also using ruvia blood blade flame grant me strength is particularly effective with this weapon since it deals 100% physical damage so 15 faith is a solid investment here swarm of flies is also a good incantation to use as well since it can further add to Blade buildup be sure to use Lord of blood's exaltation and white mask with this weapon for the attack power increase when setting the Hemorrhage status effect up next next we come to the blade of calling the blade of calling has a unique R2 attack shared with the her steel dagger and black knife and Deals physical and holy damage it's tied for the lightest stagger in Elden ring weigh 1.5 and requires six strength 13 dexterity and 15 faith in order to use effectively the blade of calling is a solid dagger it's extremely lightweight its heavy attack hits twice rapidly allowing you to use millison prosthesis or rotten Wing sword Insignia easily however you can't get this weapon until way late into the game near mountain tops of the Giants and hold damage is resisted by many end game bosses and it's one of the shorter daggers blade of gold its weapon skill does 100% holy damage and does a substantial amount of it at decent range and knocks enemies down this allows you to pick off enemies at range and if you can get into the air then you're almost uninterruptible you can also buff this damage easily with sacred scorpion charm Shard of Alexander ritual sword Talisman and holy shroud and crack tier The Sweet Spot for this weapon is around 50 faith and 50 dexterity but blade of gold only increases in damage with faith and if you want to cast incantations effectively you'll likely want to sacrifice some dexterity in order to reach higher Faith initially but eventually you'll want to increase dexterity I like to play this weapon with very high Faith allowing you to get the most from blade of gold but also to use the her tree seal and cast incantations very effectively and then we come to the last unique dagger the black knife the black knife has a unique R2 attack shared with the ER steel dagger and blade of calling and Deals physical and holy damage has an average weight for dagger and ELD ring weighing two and requires eight strength 12 dexterity and 18 faith in order to use the black knife is a fan favorite dagger for a lot of reasons the heavy attacks strike twice rapidly just like blade of calling it has the highest attack rating of unique daggers and blade of death rips off 10% of the max HP of the target however it might not be better than blade of calling and here's why blade of death does less damage overall when compared with blade of gold and blade of gold costs 17 FP compared to the 25 FP of blade of death Faith impacts the damage of both blade of gold and blade of death and blade of calling has slight better Faith scaling you can get black knife earlier than blade of calling though making it better for a first playthrough The Sweet Spot for this weapon is around 55 dexterity and minimum Faith but the weapon scales okay up to 50 Faith as well since only Faith impacts blade of death damage you might want to consider prioritizing this stat particularly if you want to cast the incantations effectively while using this weapon I like to use this weapon to stack Max HP debuffs on bosses when combined with either Destin death or blade of death or using it in a similar manner as blade of calling but with less faith and mailing a bit more frequently so then we come to the regular daggers in Elden ring or the infusible ones first up is the dagger itself the dagger shares the default move set of most other daggers and Deals physical damage it's tied for the lightest dagger in Elden ring weigh 1.5 and requires five strength and nine dexterity in order to use effectively the dagger is actually one of the better daggers in Elden rank not only can you get it quite early from Round Table hold but it's tied for lightest dagger and more importantly it has the second highest crit rating of all weapons in Elden ring Behind The Miser cord the biggest downsides are that it's the shortest dagger in Elden ring and also has pretty low attack rating for a dagger infusion wise fire and lightning comes in first at 474 with magic just behind at 468 and sacred INF flame art at 465 Keen out performs heavy 416 to 397 with cold in between at 406 I like to use this weapon in a critical focused build that takes advantage of the high critical rating of the weapon you can use it with Glen sto failings for easy stance breaks or you can use it in a Parry build both are good options make sure to use the dagger Talisman for further increases to critical damage up next we have the pairing dagger the pairing dagger shares the default move set of most other daggers and Deals physical damage it is tied for the lightest dagger in Elden ring wng 1.5 and requires five strength and 14 dexterity in order to use effectively the parrying dagger is aptly named as it gives similar eye frames to a small Shield using the Parry skill if only slightly worse it can be acquired early on in limb grave and is tied for the lightest dagger in the game however is one of the shortest daggers and has higher deck requirements than any other dagger infusion wise fire and lightning comes in first at 476 with magic and second at 472 and sacred inflame art at third at 456 Heen out performs heavy 428 to 403 with cold being in the middle at 4177 if you're using the pairing dagger you might as well lean into this aspect in order to play a pairing build however since you can do this effectively with a pairing dagger instead of a shield you can do a whe daggers and still Parry just fine make sure to use the dagger Talisman for increased critical damage Dage and use millison prothesis or rotten wi sword insignia for increased attack power via repeated attacks when you're dual building next we come to The Miser cord the misery cord has a unique R2 attack shared with a scorpion stinger and Glenstone Cris and Deals physical damage and has an average weight for dagger neld in ring wing 2 and requires seven strength and 12 dexterity in order to use The Miser cord has the highest critical rating of any weapon in ELD in ring while simultaneously also being the longest dagger in the game can also get this in storm Bale Castle which is very early on allowing you to use it very quickly infusion wise fire and lightning comes in first at 480 with magic at 472 and sacred and Flame art at 460 ke barely outperforms heavy 413 to 44 with gold outperforming both because the critical rating of this weapon is so high it makes sense to play a critical focused build with this weapon that allows you to take advantage of it because heavy is nearly as good as Keen you can even use a strength-based large weapon and then swap to this weapon for critical attacks if you want otherwise you can Parry with carrying retaliation on a shield rather easily make sure to use the dagger Talisman for more critical damage up next is the great knife great knife shares the default move set of most other daggers and Deals physical damage it's tied for the lightest dagger Nel ring wing 1.5 and requires six strength and 12 dexterity in order to use effectively the great knife is a solid dagger Bandits begin the game with it it has native bleed buildup on hit and it's one of the lightest daggers in the game the only real negative is that it's also one of the shortest daggers infusion wise fire and lightning comes in first with magic a close second and sacred and Flame art in third ke and outperforms heavy 426 to 399 with cold splitting the difference at 419 I recommend using this weapon for a status effect build that either focuses on poison and bleed or just bleed although I think rubia is better for a pure bleed Bill use Lord of blood's exaltation Kindred of rots exaltation and millison prosthesis or rotten Wing sword insignia for attack power boosts next is the blood stain dagger the blood stain dagger shares the default move set of most other daggers and Deals physical damage it has an average weight for a dagger Ned in ring Wang 2 and requires nine strength and 12 dexterity in order to use effectively The Blood Stained dagger is the go-to option for those wanting to use a dagger with superb strength sking this weapon can be farmed early on in Weeping Peninsula and has native bleed buildup on hit the biggest downside is that it's rather short for a dagger infusion wise magic comes in first at 484 with fire and lightning nearly the same at 482 and sacred and Flame art pulling up a distant third heavy outperforms Keen by nearly 30 attack rating with cold outperforming heavy use this weapon in a dual wield setup like I did with a crystal knife or use it in a build that uses a great Shield to give you a blocking option while you slash away enemies with quick block counters and R1 attacks next we come to the ER steel dagger the Earth steel dagger has a unique R2 attack shared with a blade of calling and black knife and Deals physical damage it has an average weight for a dagger and Elden ring wing two and requires seven strength and 12 dexterity and 15 faith in order to use the UR Steel zagger is quite special as it's the only Faith scaling weapon in Elden ring that does 100% physical damage that can still be buffed you can acquire two of them as well but it has the lowest attack rating of any dagger and Elden ring except if you're playing with the sacred or flame art infusions then it has the highest attack rating of all daggers sacred and Flame art com in at a whopping 544 attack rating with magic way way far behind at 410 fire and lightning in third at 384 ke out performs heavy by 13 attack rating and cold barely break takes 300 attack rating the best way to use this weapon is probably to dual wield two of these set to Flame AR are sacred or using one in the off hand with another unique dagger in the right hand like black knife or blade of calling crank faith and buff with golden vow and Flame grant me strength for even more damage and you can reach over 1,000 attack power with two her steel daggers when set up this way which is ridiculous next is the Waki zashi the walki zashi shares the default move set of most other daggers and Deals physical damage it's the heaviest dagger n ring WI three and requires nine strength and 13 dexterity in order to use effectively the Waki zashi is an interesting weapon because even though it is classified as a dagger it cannot be power stanced with other daggers but can be with other katas has native bleed buildup just like they do and has the highest attack rating of all daggers generally and is the heaviest dagger this would lead one to believe that it's not really a dagger and more of a katana especially since it has 100 crit rating just like other katas infusion wise magic comes in first at 522 attack rating with SA in flame art and fire and lightning basically tied for second Heen outperforms heavy by a small amount and cold outperforms both of them you can power stance this weapon with an Uchi Katana or another Katana if you wish if you don't happen to have a second Uchi Katana but I don't really see much of other way that you would use this weapon since likely you won't just be using a single Waki zashi when you could use an Uchi Katana as a single weapon or as a single weapon and shield cuz that weapon has much longer reach and has higher damage next is the celebrant sickle the celebrant shares the default move set of most other daggers and Deals physical damage it's tied for the lightest dagger Nel and ring weighing 1.5 and requires six strength and 11 dexterity in order to use effectively the celebran sickle is not the greatest dagger ring you won't find it until late into the game in Windmill Village if you can be bothered to farm it and it has 100 crit rating which is bad for a dagger however it is tied for the lightest dagger El ring and it does Grant 10 runes per hit and some of its damage does go through enemy Shields infusion wise far and lightning comes in first Magic just behind and sacred and Flame art coming in a third peen out performs heavy by 40 attack rating and cold splits the difference it is likely that you'll have a better Dagger by the time you can farm this weapon but if you insist on doing so probably the best way to play it is by using two of them in order to get 10 runes per hit very quickly stack Buffs like millison prothesis and winged sword Insignia to boost attack power next is the Ivory sickle the ivory CLE shares the default move set of most other daggers and Deals physical and Magic damage has an average weight for dagger n ring wing 2 and requires six Strength 11 dexterity and 13 intelligence in order to use effectively there are not a lot of great ways to use the dagger it cannot be buffed or infused despite not being unique and it has 100 crit rating which is terrible for a dagger the upside is that you can find it pretty early on in the village of the Alban arxs and it's one of the longest daggers in Alden Ring The Sweet Spot for this weapon is right about 55 intelligence and 45 dexterity with nearly 50/50 split damage types between physical and Magic you could prioritize intelligence if you want and want to be a spellcaster with this weapon as a backup I like to put this weapon in my offhand and use it in a dual wield build where you will neither need its weapon skill nor its critical rating and it scales similarly to the Glenstone chis which is a good pairing with the Chis in the main hand for a better skill and crit rating you could also use a cold Infuse Dagger of some kind as well with another weapon skill in the main hand if you don't want to wait to get the Chris up next is the crystal knife Crystal knife shares the default move set of most other daggers and Deals physical and Magic damage it has an average weight for dagger n and ring Wang and requires eight strength 12 dexterity and nine intelligence in order to use effectively similar to the Ivory sickle the crystal knife cannot be buffed nor infused but it's not a unique dagger it's also one of the shortest daggers in the game and has 100 crit rating which is again not good for a dagger however you can find it quite early in R lucaria Academy and it has pretty high attack rating for a dagger The Sweet Spot for this weapon is around 50 strength and 50 intelligence though dexterity doesn't scale too badly and it's likely you'll take it up to 50 after these two which makes this weapon good for new game plus I like to put this weapon in my off hand and use it in a dual wield build where you'll neither need its weapon skill nor its critical rating and it scales similarly to The Blood Stained dagger when it's set to the cold infusion this allows you to select a better Ash of War for the bloodstained dagger while still getting the high attack rating from the crystal knighte so that wraps up our video on why daggers are the best weapon Elden ring I think it's pretty clear to see at this point that daggers are definitely not the best weapon type but there are some really really strong daggers in this game and I think you'd be surprised once you set your mind to it and you just try and play with a dagger what you can accomplish particularly with the very high critical rating that most of these weapons have stay tuned because we got more Elden ring content coming as we draw closer to shadow of the UR Tree in just over a month going to be wrapping up our weapon videos doing some more builds Etc and if you guys have any questions about these daggers or if you have comments things and tips that I missed about some of them

Title: Claws are the Best Weapon in Elden Ring - Elden Ring All Claws Breakdown
Video ID: 6ZWlwjBnYMI

in this Elden ring video I'm going to be showing you why claws are the best weapon in Elden ring this is our 22nd video where we go through all the different weapons in a weapon category go through their pros and cons in order to help you make better decisions about why you might use them or not in your build before we get into the weapons themselves however first let's go through the pros and cons of this weapon group as well as play Styles I think most people will use when using claws so first for pros the attack speed of claws is extremely fast they might even be the fastest attacking weapons in the game they exceptionally fast and this allows you to hit rapidly building up attack power with like rotten Wing sword Insignia or set status effects more easily even after the status effect Nerf from several patches ago another major plus point of this weapon is that they're always paired meaning that you can actually use two of these even though you only have one equipped this allows you to have lighter equip load when using this and it also allows you if you buff your right-hand weapon to also buff your offhand weapon at the same time so if you buff with something like blood flame blade or lightning Armament or Scholar's Armament Etc you're going to buff both weapons simultaneously and both will benefit from The increased attack rating they're also an extremely lightweight weapon the lowest weighing 1.5 and the highest weighing three so they do not weigh hardly anything at all additionally they have a very good dual wield move set allowing them to strike rapidly with it and they also have good crit rating all of the claws except one have 110 crit rating so that's better than most weapons in the game and all four claws have status effects natively on them so you're going to be able to set status effects with this weapon group the negatives of this weapon group are that they have low attack rating in general although it's not as low as some weapons also the Dual will status effects have been nerfed you know in previous patches so you don't set up status effect will dual wielding as much as you used to which still applies to the paired weapons of Claws and this weapon group has short reach compared to a lot of other weapons in the game and probably the last thing is that this weapon type has has relatively low stance damage so you're not really going to get stance breaks easily with this weapon type in terms of play Styles I think the vast majority of people who are using claws are simply going to use them in some sort of hybrid build where they spellcast and then do a wield while they you know buff their claws with something cast spells when they want but generally speaking most people are going to lean into the paired nature of claws dual wield them and attack rapidly with them trying to set status effects or build up their attack power in that manner so those things being said let's get into the CLA of themselves there are no unique claws in Elden ring all four claws are infusible so let's get into the infusible claws the first up is the hook claws the hook claw shares the default move set of most other Claws and Deals physical damage it's one of the lightest claws in El ring weighing two and requires eight strength and 14 dexterity in order to use effectively the hook claws have a lot of things going for them they are the longest claws in Elden ring they're the second lightest they have native bleed buildup on hit and you can find them pretty early on in storm Veil Castle their only downside is that that they deal less damage than all but the Raptor's talents infusion wise fire and lightning comes in first at 532 attack rating with magic just behind at 527 and sacred and Flame AR pulling up third at 505 key out performs heavy with cold being virtually tied with key I like to use this weapon with flaming strikes set to Flame art in order to buff both weapons with fire further boosting their attack rating this also allows you to cast incantations effectively due to high faith and you can reach over 1,000 attack power when fully buffed with this setup the bleed is just a bonus use Talisman like rotten wi sword Insignia fire scorpion charm Shard of Alexander to further boost damage make sure you have 51 po you can trade damage without interruption next up are The Blood Hound claws The Blood Hound claws share the default move set of most other Claws and deal physical damage it's the heaviest claw in Elden ring weighing three and requires 10 strength and 15 dexterity in order to use effectively The Blood Hound claws are the go-to option for those wanting to play a strength-based claws build with na a bed build up on hit some of their damage slips through Shields and they have the second highest attack rating of all claws however they are the second shortest Claws and you cannot get them until volcano Manor which can take a while infusion wise fire and lightning and Magic are tied for first at 549 with secret and Flame art coming in second at 528 heavy outperforms Keen by a point and cold is ahead of both of them the cold is also not bad at 450 I like to play this weapon with a heavy infusion leaning into the decent strength scaling of the weapon and buffing it with blood flame blade to apply extra beded buildup for each claw if you use something like endure you can tank through hits while swinging rapidly triggering Hemorrhage easily and stacking up attack rating through talismans like fla blood's exaltation and rotten Wing sword Insignia while also using the thorny cracked here up next is the venomous Fang the venos Fang shares the default move set of most other Claws and Deals physical damage it's the second heaviest claw in Elder ring weighing 2.5 and requires nine strength and nine dexterity in order to use effectively the venomous Fang might seem great at first glance it has native deadly poison buildup which ticks for more damage than regular poison but over a much shorter duration it has the lowest requirements of all Claws and the highest attack rating of all claws however they are the shortest Claws by a lot and they have the lowest crit rating of all Claws and you really feel the short reach of this weapon compared to others it is really very noticeable infusion wise magic and fire and lightning are virtually tied at 576 and 575 with sacred and Flame art coming in second at 545 Keen outperforms heavy 504 to 498 with cold also at 504 and a CT at 471 I like to play these weapons with the blood infusion since the Arcane scaling will also impact the poison buildup on the weapon and bleed is typically more useful than poison even if it is the deadly variant use indor to tank hits and continue to spam attacks on bosses setting both status effects and use rotten Wing sword Insignia Lord of blood's exaltation and Kindred of rots exaltation for increased attack power and lastly we come to the Raptor Talons the Raptor Talons have a unique heavy attack that jumps and deal physical damage it's the lightest claw ELD ring weighing 1.5 and requires six strength and 14 dexterity in order to use effectively the Raptor Talons are the only claws with an alternate move set and their jump attack damage is about 10% higher than other claws assuming the attack ratings are the same they also have native bleed build up like other claws but they have the lowest attack rating of all claws in Elden ring infusion wise fire and lightning comes in first at 518 with magic in second at 511 and sacred and Flame art in third at 478 attack rating ke outperforms heavy 469 to 444 and cold is just under Keen I like to use these weapons in a jump attack build to take advantage of the unique properties of the weapon not unlike my cold blooded Raptor build where you use the claw Talisman Raptor's black feathers and Royal Knights resolve to buff jump attacks you can also use the sacrificial axe in your offhand to refund FP when you kill enemies if you want additionally ritual sword Talisman is not bad for this build since you tend to not get hit that often when jump attacking enemies this way so that wraps up our video on why claws are the best weapon Elden ring this is actually an exceptionally good weapon group you can hit very high attack ratings and I feel like this native status effect buildup of these weapons is just a bonus a lot of the time and you can really make a deadly build using these and I look forward to putting out another one very soon so when it comes to your standard weapons we only have fists left which I'm also going to try and get out later this week before we have spellcasting implements and Bows I'm going to try and get videos out for those I know that you guys will probably want to see those we might also do shields potentially armor before the DLC we'll see how much time we have as we will be squeaking in builds here and there as well the Bose videos and the you know spellcasting implements videos will probably be a little bit different format since there's no move sets involved and there's no Ash of War really involved in those weapons probably be more comparing stats and the unique properties of those weapons as always if you have other comments or tips of things that I forgot to mention in this video please leave them in the comments below and if you have questions and leave them there as well if you have a request for a build you can also leave that [Music] [Music] [Music]

Title: Fists are the Best Weapon in Elden Ring - Elden Ring All Fists Breakdown
Video ID: LDnkhbdKMn8

in this elen ring video I'm going to be showing you why fists are the best weapon in elen ring this is our 23rd video where we go through all the different weapons in a different weapon category go through their pros and cons and help you make better decisions about why you might use them in your build or not however before we get into the weapons themselves first let's get into the pros and cons of this weapon group and into the styles of play I think most people will use when using this weapon group so starting with the pros first this weapon group has an extremely fast attack speed allowing them to hit enemies over and over and to take advantages of things that buff damage when you hit rapidly like winged sword Insignia or millison prosthesis or the thorny crack tier additionally all but one fist weapon is paired allowing you to use two of them with only one equipped giving you very light equip load when using them and these weapons also are extremely lightweight the lowest I think weighs 1.5 and the heaviest weighing four so they do not weigh much at all allowing you to manage your equip weight rather easily when using them they also have a fantas ftic dual wield move set allowing you to hit enemies effectively when using the paired version of this weapon and it's just there's not too many weapons that strike that quickly in the game as fists there's also a good variety of damage types in fists some have strik some have slash some have thrust so compared to claws for example you're going to be able to get you know different damage types and you can select the fist you want with the damage type that you like and then lastly this weapon type has more stance damage than Claus by a lot and daggers so if you like the rapid attack speed of those weapon sets but you don't like that you're having trouble stance breaking this might be a better weapon group for you the cons of this weapon group are that they have lower attack rating than a lot of weapons in the game and that dual wield status effects were nerfed a couple patches ago so they don't set statuses as well as they once did and they have extremely short reach making it difficult to hit some enemies even when you're Point Blank I think the vast majority of people will use this weapon in two ways they will either use the Dual move set or the paired move set of the weapon which I think is what most people will do most of the time or they'll probably single-hand it with a shield something like that lean into the fast charged heavy attacks this weapon group has that allow them to get stance breaks a lot more reliably than you might imagine and one more thing I want to get into before we get into the weapons themselves is that there seem to be two distinctly different types of fists in Elden ring you have the case Spike case dist iron ball and starfist which seem to be in a category their own and operate very very similarly and then you have all the other fists which seem to operate in a different way and usually those first four have strike damage and the other ones typically have slash standard or thrust damage and their move sets are similar the four in the first group have similar move sets whereas the other five in the other group have similar move sets so let's jump into the unique ones first clinging bone is first and the clinging bone shares the default attack of that subcategory of fist I just mentioned mentioned and Deals physical and Magic damage it has a heavy weight for fists and eldering Wing three and requires eight strength 22 dexterity and 16 Arcane in order to use effectively the clinging bone weapon seems strange at first glance it can be missed if you do certain things out of order and it has strange requirements for a fist weapon however it's quite long for fist it's one-handed charged heavy attacks are lightning fast life steal fist is fantastic and despite being split damaged the vast majority of it is physical you can also get it quite quickly if you know how life steal fists can be used to sunlock hard to kill humanish enemies even going through Shields preventing them from being any challenge whatsoever even though the damage this weapon skill is average on top of this the skill heals you for 30% of your max HP which is absolutely nuts this allows you to skew your flasks to the FP side and use this to heal while defeating enemies easily there does seem to be a small cool down though so you can't spam it back to back and it does mostly magic damage additionally it Ducks under many attacks which makes it easier to use despite it some long windup and it triggers winged sword Insignia or millison prothesis since each damage tick is considered a hit the sweet spot for this weapon is around 50ish dexterity and 50 Arcane though the weapon scales much better with dexterity than Arcane however Arcane increases the damage of Life steel fist so it's really up to you which you using more the regular attacks or life steal fist I like to use this weapon one-handed for its fast heavy attacks that stagger enemies easily using life steal fist on difficult enemies or when I need healing you can use a shield in your off hand for Block counters since fists do Decent Block counter stance damage and this can allow you to use assassin Cilan dagger to replenish FP to use life steel fists make sure to use Shard of Alexander to further boost life steel fist damage and ritual sword Talisman works well with this weapon as well since you tend to stay full health note that magic scorpion charm also increases the damage of Life steal fist significantly so you might want to consider that in this build even though it's not going to do much for your regular attacks up next is the Veterans prosthesis veterans prosthesis shares the default attacks of most fists and Deals physical and lightning damage it is the heaviest fist weapon in Elden ring Wang 4 and requires 15 strength and 12 dexterity in order to use effectively the Veteran's prosthesis is better than it would first appear it's the longest fist weapon in Elden ring it's one-handed charged heavy attacks or lightning fast it has very high attack rating for fists and storm kick can be deadly when used properly however you cannot get it until near the end of the game in mountain tops of the Giants so it's more of a journey to weapon storm kick is relatively cheap at 10 FP and slams your weapon into the ground interrupting enemies and dealing damage in an AOE and then allows for a followup attack that costs zero FP that does even more damage and leaps forward into the air landing and another damaging AOE this skill can take some getting used to because a followup attack has a smaller AOE than you would think and it's easy to miss enemies however the damage is good enough for such a cheap weapon skill and you can often one-hot even tough to kill enemies the first attack deals more physical damage than lightning while the followup deals more lightning damage than physical but both attacks do a mix of the two damage types the sweet spot for this weapon is 50 strength and 50 dexterity and you'll take these both up to 80 in Journey 2 but you won't get hardly any damage out of this weapon after that making this worse in Journey 3 than in Journey 2 I like to use this weapon with a great shield in one hand for quick attacks block counter stance breaks and to bust out storm kick when I need AOE or when facing tough to kill enemies like the clinging bone you can use assassin suran dagger to replenish FP from block counters allowing you to keep using storm kick up next is the cipher the cipher shares the default attacks of most fists and Deals 100% holy damage it's the lightest fist in Elden ring weighing zero and requires 30 faith in order to use effectively the cipher is a great weapon for incantation builds that have high Faith since the weapon requires no other stats but Faith it's a natural companion to such builds additionally it deals 100% holy damage making it easy to buff its damage with sacred scorpion charm and holy shroud and crack tier it also weighs zero making it extremely easy to manage your weight and unblockable blade goes through Shields and cannot be pared unblockable blade does a decent amount of damage but it's not cheap at 17 FP and doesn't sweep like the cated sword variant so it's only going to strike one enemy for that cost however it does 30 stance damage which is great and one-handed charged heavy attacks also do 30 stance damage with this weapon you can stance break rather easily with it the sweet spot for this weapon is around 50 Faith only gaining 60 attack rating between 50 and 99 Faith however since you're likely to be using incantations with this build taking Faith up higher is advised but but this weapon will do worse and worse with every playthrough since it cannot gain much damage past 50 I like to use this weapon with a her tree seal in order to cast incantations with very high Faith buff with golden vow and either oneand or twohand this weapon whichever you prefer sacred scorpion charm is great with it but you may not want to use it if you opt to use spells that don't do holy damage and next we come to the last unique fist which is the grafted Dragon the grafted Dragon shares the default attacks of most fists and Deals physical and fire damage it has an average weight for a fist in Elden ring weighing 2.5 and requires 20 strength 14 dexterity and 16 faith in order to use effectively the grafted dragon is actually pretty great for fist weapon but there are some quirks with this one first of all it's not paired like other fists you cannot do wield two of these unless you acquire second one in Journey 2 or from another player though it can be dual wielded with other fists if you want if held in the off hand its weapon skill will override the right-hand weapon just like a shield would do it also has high requirements for a fist and it's tied for the shortest Fist and ring however you can get it relatively early on from defeating godric the grafted it deals extra damage to dragons and ancient dragons it has very quick charged heavy attacks that can stance break easily and its weapon skill bear witness is quite deadly when used properly bear witness crouches the player down and then swings upward with the weapon dealing exclusively fire damage that sprays upward and then Rains Down in an area the damage of this attack is better than average the initial squat can duck under attacks and the fire remains on the ground for some time dealing additional damage and since it does a 100% fire damage bear witness is easily boosted by fire scorpion charm and fire shot and crack tier the major downside is that it costs 20 FP so it's hard to use all that often The Sweet Spot for this weapon is around 50 strength with minimum points in dexterity and Faith but the weapon scales well up to 50 dexterity and okay up to 50 Faith with dexterity being better damage wise however since only Faith affects be witness you might want to consider adding some points here especially since 25 faith will let you cast golden vow and Flame gramy strength both of which are great for this build I like to use this weapon in my right hand and a great Shield to my left due to the Natural strength scaling and use the claw Mark seal to cast incantations as necessary block counters with this weapon typically stance break most regular enemies so you can use this to gain FP back with assassin thrilling dagger to fund your bare witness uses next let's move to the infusible fist starting with the casus the casus has a unique R2 that strikes repeatedly that it's shared with the spike casus and Deals physical damage it's the second lightest fist in Elden ring weighing 1.5 and requires eight strength and eight dexterity in order to use effectively the casis can be really fun to play if you lean into its rapid attacks you can acquire it early in storm Veil Castle it's very light for a fist and has the lowest requirements of all fists however it's in the bottom half of fists and damage and it has very short reach and small hit boxes that make it easy to miss attacks Endor is a solid weapon skill because it allows you to tank through attacks and continue your Flurry of Blows on the enemy which can really pump out damage Quick Step is also not a bad option allowing you to slide through attack rather than tank them but does reset your combos the upside is that you don't get hit as much as is using endure infusion wise magic fire lightning and sacred inflame art are really not that far apart and heavy slightly outperforms Keen with cold just behind I like to pler the rapid attacks of this weapon and use talismans like Wing sword Insignia and millison prothesis to boost attack power while I swing rapidly additionally the ACT Talisman is not a bad choice either since the heavy attacks of this weapon hit repeatedly allowing you to make the most of the previous talismans while using charged heavy attacks you'll likely want to upgrade to the spiked casus at some point if you like this weapon since it does more damage and has B buildup up next is the spiked casus the spiked casus shares the same attack pattern as the casus and does physical damage it's fairly light for fists and Elden ring weighing two and requires eight strength and 10 dexterity in order to use effectively the spiked Cas disc for all intents and purposes is just a better version of the casus it has slightly higher requirements in weight but it has a tad more damage and Native bleed build upon on hit which is more than a fair trade-off infusion wise magic comes in at 534 attack rating with fire and lightning at 529 and sacred and Flame or just behind at 527 heavy outperforms Keen by a small amount with cold just behind and a cold is also not terrible at 450 Endor is not a bad weapon skill but I like to change to life steel fist for this weapon and set to the ult Affinity this improves the bleed buildup on the weapon as you increase Arcane while having more attack rating than blood additionally life steal fist damage increases with the Arcane stat so by adding Arcane scaling we also improve its damage remember that life steal fist does mostly magic damage so magic scorpion charm and Magic shrouding crack here will increase the damage of this weapon skill up next is the Qatar the Qatar shares the default attacks of most fists and Deals physical damage has an average weight for fists in Elden ring wing 2.5 and requires eight strength and 10 dexterity in order to use effectively the Qatar has really one claim to fame it's the only fist weapon with 110 critical rating making it more deadly when doing critical attacks than other fist weapons it's also the only fist weapon that comes with impaling thrust though the cyphert is unblockable blade is virtually the same thing infusion wise magic comes in first at 529 with fire and lightning at 520 and sacred and Flame art at 513 ke outperforms heavy by just over a dozen points with cold just behind I highly recommend making a build that leans into stance breaks with this weapon or block counters in order to take advantage of the extra critical damage of the weapon this means one- handing it most likely in using a shield or great shield in the off hand you can further boost critical damage with a dagger Talisman and if you choose the fire infusion then you'll have high strength making it easier to use grade Shields with this up next is the iron ball the iron ball shares the default attacks of most fists but has a unique two-handed R2 attack that it shares with the star Fist and Deals physical damage it has an average weight for fists in Elden ring weighing 2.5 and requires 11 strength and eight dexterity in order to use effectively the iron ball hits like a truck and is in the upper half of fist when it comes to a attack rating you can acquire it rather quickly by defeating blackard big Bogard and its only real downside is that it's tied for shortest fist nen ring B's Roar is attached to this weapon when you first pick it up and increases physical damage by 10% increases damage negation by 10% and increases stamina recovery by 20% while changing your charged heavy attack into the same attack that war cry provides Roar Medallion and Highland axe both affect the damage of these attacks infusion wise magic comes in first with 543 attack rating with fire and lightning at 537 and sacred INF flame art at 518 heavy outperforms Keen by 34 attack rating and cold splits the difference I like to use these weapons in a similar manner as the casus focusing on dishing out attacks while either tanking or dodging damage with end door or Quick Step while stacking damage Buffs from rotten Wing sword Insignia and axe Talisman and lastly we come to the starfist the starfist shares the default attacks of most fists but has a unique two-handed R2 attack that it shares with the iron ball and Deals physical damage has a heavy weight for fists in Elden ring wing three and requires 12 strength and eight dexterity in order to use effectively the starfist operates much the same way as the iron ball except it weighs a little more and has slightly higher requirements it has na to bed build up on hit and you cannot find it until the Lendale Royal capital endur is a good weapon skill as allows you to keep on swinging ramping up your damage and triggering Hemorrhage with this weapon but you could use life steal fist in the same manner as I used it with a spike case just for similar reasons infusion wise magic comes in first at 560 with fire and lightning just behind at 553 and sacred inflame AR at 535 heavy outperforms ke by 33 points and cold splits the difference either use this weapon with the ult affinity and life steal fist or use another infusion and go for stance breaks with charged heavy attacks that hit like a truck so that wraps up our video about why fists are the best weapon in Elden ring this is actually a fantastic weapon group I didn't think I was going to like it as much as claw after how much I really enjoyed claw but the ability to stance break far more easily than that weapon group we still having the same fast attack speed it's absolutely fantastic and I cannot recommend this weapon group enough people looking to try something a bit different stay tuned for more Elden ring content as we got more builds coming and more content as we lead up to shadow of the UR tree if you guys have other suggestions for fists maybe that I didn't mention or questions about them please leave them in the comments below [Music] [Music] [Music]

Title: Bows are the Best Weapon in Elden Ring - Elden Ring All Bows, Light Bows & Greatbows Breakdown
Video ID: kYkJnXDx-Y4
Transcript Text:
in this Elden ring video I'm going to be talking a little bit about light bows bows and great bows in Elden ring going into the pros and cons them talking about how each one how they operate why you might use one or another in your build obviously this is a little bit different of a video than would be any of the other weapon videos that we've done even though it's going to cover similar information because bows don't have a move set the way that other weapons do so that is not a factor in here and they have a very limited amount of weapon skills so before we get into the weapons them eles let's talk a little bit first about some of these weapon skills and what exactly they do so first upep we have barrage barrage is a weapon skill that gives you essentially a 33% damage penalty per arrow and reduced status effect buildup just a little bit in exchange for a 50% increased in fire rate and costs to FP to use so effectively you're sacrificing damage per shot to be able to unleash more arrows in a very quick space of time effectively and I have made a few builds using this weapon skill and I think the real strength of this weapon skill is at medium to short range because you can use it very quickly and it excels in my opinion at status effect buildup even though you have reduced status effect per shot the fact that you can fire off so many arrows quickly in succession generally means that you're going to be able to apply statuses more easily than some of the other weapon skills moving on to Mighty shot this skill makes it so that you have 75% more damage versus a regular arrow and 75% more status effect versus a regular arrow that you know may have a status effect if you're using one that does as well as adding range to your arrows fired and dealing some damage through blocks for 6 FP so this kind of removes the need for like the arrows reach Talisman on a lot of bows if you're using that you might not need that if you're using Mighty shot a lot and in my opinion it's the go-to ash of War if you are you know early in the middle of the game or even late game when you're trying to pick off enemies with one Arrow it's a great way to conserve arrows because you tend to kill enemies more quickly with it and could sometimes One-Shot them with it and I think probably all in all it's probably the best allaround Ash of War for a bow so next we come to Enchanted shot and what this does is increases the damage that you're going to do with that shot by 50% as well as status effect buildup by 50% it has about the same length of Animation as my shot looks very similar but it also homes onto the target a bit and curves to hit them when needed it can miss Target still if they're very very quick but it's good at hitting more mobile targets so if you're fighting something a bit more mobile might have a hard time hitting it with Mighty shot Enchanted shot might do better for you it does cost more FP at eight and Deals less damage so you're sacrificing damage and FP in order to try and hit something that's a bit more mobile skyshot deals 33% more damage than a regular arrow and arcs very high to the sky coming down onto the head of the target though this cannot be used in places with a ceiling as it blocks the arrow so you won't be able to use this indoors at all pretty much and what's great about this weapon skill is that head shots deal more damage than body shots depending on the enemy type of course some enemies are not weak or don't have like a head area that that's weak so this isn't always true but when you hit the head of the enemy using Sky shot it will actually outperform Mighty shot in terms of overall damage cuz mighty shot always locks onto the Torso is of the enemy or a body part like the leg or arm or something like that so you're always getting body shot damage with Mighty shot whereas you tend to get more head shot with Sky shot so it's it's diff more difficult to use but the reward can be higher than Mighty shot the problem I find though is that depending on where you're positioned near an enemy you tend to hit the back of their neck a lot like if you're behind an enemy and you're playing kind of stealthily and you shoot from behind them and you're going to hit the back of their neck more often than not not getting that head shot damage but getting body shot instead so you want to try and be on the side of the enemy or the front of the enemy when using this skill in order to get maximum damage so then we come to rain of arrows and what this skill does is it deals 50% less damage and Status effect buildup but it sort of splits your arrow into multiple arrows that come down on the target hitting them multiple times and when it hits them multiple times you know this adds up to over 100% damage most of the time particularly on large targets so you tend to get more damage Dage and more status effect buildup when using this versus other weapon skills and it's probably you know the pound-for-pound king of damage when it comes to weapon skills and that's why it costs 20 FP because you're doing more damage on average and so therefore it costs more FP to use and what I really love about rain of arrows is it's the only weapon skill that you can use on light bows bows or great bows so it's Universal across all of them and you might be thinking well if I use it on great bows I'm going to do more damage so that that's the only reason you should use it you should only use it on a great bow but there are no bleed arrows on great bows great bows do not have bleed arrows so the reason you might want to use it on a bow or a light bow is because you could use bleed arrows and therefore set bleeding rather easily on a lot of targets so consider that when trying to decide whether you want to use a great bow or a bow and then lastly we come to through and through this can only be used on great bows so you're only going to be able to use this on great bows and this does 30% more damage with gr arrows and pierces the target hitting enemies behind the target cost 9 FP so essentially this is a more expensive Mighty shot kind of but doesn't deal as much damage as mighty shot but it can hit arrows you know hit enemies in a line so the cons are that generally speaking you're not hitting enemies in a line in this game so I'm not a huge fan of through and through in general but it does have its uses in some areas so let's take a look at light bows first we'll get into the pros and cons of this weapon group before we start looking at the individual weapons pros of this weapon group are that they have fast attack speed you can jump and shoot land and shoot Sprint and shoot roll and shoot very quickly with this weapon group you can't do this with bows or great bows meaning that this weapon type if you're going to be be playing close range with a bow is the the weapon type to use you're not going to do this with a bow or a great bow also most light bows can be found extremely early on in ELD ring allowing you to play this weapon style very quickly they're very lightweight making it easy to manage your weight and they have the highest versatility of Ashes of War of all bow types they can use five of the six weapon skills that bows can use so that's another big Pro for this weapon group The downsides of this weapon group are that they have lower damage per shot than all other bow type weapons they have the shortest range of all bow type weapons by about half and they have extremely poor scaling meaning you don't get a lot of damage out of invest points into strength and dexterity compared to other weapons in Elden ring bows and great bows and light bows in general all have pretty bad scaling as you get you know down to Great bows the scaling does get better but I wouldn't call them fantastic by any means so let's take a look at the har bow first the har bow does physical damage and it's the lightest bow in Elden ring wi too it requires nine strength and nine dexterity in order to use effectively the harp bow is the lightest bow and has very low stat require requirements but you won't get it until it weighs into the game in the Shaded Castle you cannot change its weapon skill barrage and it has the lowest damage of all light bows by a lot this weapon scales slightly better with dexterity than strength but not by a lot and has poor scaling in general so I would avoid worrying about adding damage through scaling with this weapon the only real reason to use this weapon is because it makes a harp sound when firing arrows allowing you to live out your baric Archer fantasy up next is the short bow the short bow does physical damage and has an average weight for light bow and Elden ring wing 2.5 it requires eight strength and 10 dexterity in order to use effectively the short bow has the second lowest damage of all light bows and has terrible scaling but can be acquired at the very beginning of the game it has very low requirements and you can change its Ash of War this weapon scales identically with either strength or dexterity meaning you can use it in either a strength or deck's build until you find a better weapon but has poor scaling in general the best reason to use this weapon is its ease of acquisition at the very beginning of the game and the fact that anyone can use it with little stat investment but you will definitely want to swap this out for a stronger light bow when you find one up next is the Red Branch short bow the Red Branch short bow does physical damage and has an average weight for a light bow and Elden ring wing 2.5 and it requires eight strength and 16 dexterity in order to use effectively the Red Branch short bow can be acquired in tombs word runes early on you can change its Ash of war and it has almost no strength requirements making it a good choice if you're going for a pure DEX Build however it is outclassed by the black bow damage and range wise making it a better choice if you don't mind the extra 1.5 weight the Red Branch short bow scales slightly better with dexterity than strength making it better on Dex builds than strength but not by a lot however since it has a 16 dexterity requirement it's a natural choice for early game deck builds up next is the composite bow the composite bow does physical damage and is tied for the heaviest light bow in ring wing 3 it requires 15 strength and 15 dexterity in order to use effectively a composite bow can be acquired from Merchant and learning of Lakes you can change its Ash of war and it has the second highest attack rating of all light bows however it is the heaviest light bow at three and has the highest requirements of all light bows though again this is slightly misleading because you really only need 2third of the listed strength to use any bow weapon the composite bow scales slightly better with dexterity than strength making it another good choice for dexterity builds despite its higher strength requirement however if you've already been upgrading the Red Branch short bow you might want to wait in order to get the black bow that is better than both these light bows and the last Light bow is the Mis begotten short bow the Mis begotten short bow does physical damage and is tied for the heaviest light bow in Elden ring weighing three it requires 16 strength and eight dexterity in order to use effectively just keep in mind again that you only need 2/3 the strength to actually wield this so This is actually 11 strength the Mis begotten short bow has the highest damage of all light bows it has better scaling than all light bows you can change its Ash of war and you can Farm it easily in Weeping Peninsula however it is tied for the heaviest light bat three and it has shorter range than all of their light bows though not by a ton the Mis begotten short bow skills vary slightly better with strength and dexterity making it a good choice for strength builds that want a ranged option at least until you can upgrade to the black bow and just before we get into the bows themselves one thing that I want to mention that I probably should have mentioned earlier is that light bows bows and great bows have what is called a range in this game and that affects the damage that they deal when you get outside of the range of a bow you start getting less and less damage Dage the further away you get from the Target and it's a sliding scale so you're not going to like take one step out of range and do half damage you're going to take one step out of range to do 95% damage or 90% damage and the further away you get the less damage you're going to get so the longer range your bow has the more distance you can have between you and the Target and still maintain 100% damage know that this doesn't apply to status effect buildup if you're using like bleed arrows or something like that the status effect buildup Remains the Same but the damage of that Arrow will go down you know when you hit the target with the arrow itself and one of the things about short bows which is why I'm mentioning it here is that because short bows have such short range compared to both bows and great bows they have half the range on average or just about half the range it's like 60% of the range that the arrows reach Talisman is almost a must when using this weapon if you want to use it anything other than like very very close to your target so if you're using light bows in this game I highly recommend equipping using the arrows reach Talisman in order to extend your range and to keep your damage High even when you're at longer ranges so next we'll get into the pros and cons of bows before we get into each of the seven bows and the first thing to note is that they have higher attack rating than light bows so that's a good reason to use them they have more versatility in ashes of War compared to Great bows so there's a little bit more flexibility there even though they have lower damage than great bows they're only slightly heavier than light bows in general so they're really don't weigh that much and they have the same range as great bow so there isn't like a range discrepancy between great bows and regular bows the cons of this weapon group are that they can't jump and shoot and land and shoot and Sprint and shoot and roll and shoot like light bows can so they're much harder to use in close range proximity compared to light bows and there are not too many long bows or regular bows early on in the game so you're not going to be able to find too many of these early on so first up is the hornbow the hornbow does phys IAL and Magic damage and is tied for the second heaviest bow in elen ring weighing 4.5 it requires 10 strength 14 dexterity and 12 intelligence in order to use effectively the horn bow is arguably the worst bow in Elden ring and it does terrible damage compared to most other bows in just about every instance however you can change its Ash of War you can find it pretty early on in sheer River and it increases the damage ratio of dwelling arrows to more magic damage allowing you to boost their damage more easily with things like magic scorpion charm magic shroud and crack tier and Terra Magic this weapon scales the best with dexterity up to 50 then strength and in Scales horribly with this weapon which is a shame as this can help boost magic damage if you're going to use this weapon you pretty much must use dwelling arrows exclusively or you might as well use another bow however since the scaling is mostly dexterity you could use a second bow with regular arrows and swap to this one when you want to deal magic damage with dwelling arrows without sacrificing damage on the other bow up next is the serent bow the serent bow does physical damage and it's the lightest bow Elden ring wi 3.5 it requires eight strength 15 dexterity and 11 Arcane in order to use effectively the serpent bow is a strange weapon it adds 15 poison buildup on any Arrow it fires it's the lightest bow in Elden ring and its native Arcane scaling means that arrows fired from it like blood poison or sleep arrows will have more buildup than other bows however and this is a big however placing points into Arcane for this weapon does not increase Arrow damage and only increases status effect buildup this means you must choose between more damage or more status effects with your arrows and since even when optimized for the most damage possible the serpent bow still has lower damage than other bows you should really only be using this weapon if you plan to go the status effect route Mighty shot does not make this easy in Close Quarter boss fights though and you cannot roll and shoot or land and shoot like a light bow making this a tricky bow to use next is the long bow the long bow does physical damage and is tied for the second lightest bow in Elden ring wing four requires nine strength and 14 dexterity in order to use effectively the long bow is a solid allaround bow it does decent damage you can acquire it very early in Round Table hold and it's one of three bows that can change ashes of war the scaling on it is very slightly better with dexterity than strength making it viable for either type of build it's the best bow you can use early on in the game if you want to swap out Mighty shot for rain of arrows but eventually you'll want to replace it with the albinar bow up next is the black bow the black bow does physical damage and is tied for the second lightest bow in ELD ring wing 4 it requires nine strength and 20 dexterity in order to use effectively the black bow is unique for a bow since it operates identically to a light bow except it's a bit heavier and has much better range it also has very low damage for a bow which is better than all light bows but worse than nearly every other bow and has barrage as its weapon skill just like a light bow this weapon scales slightly better with dexterity than strength but not by much making it suited for either type of build the scaling of the weapon is better than light bows and some bows but it's not great in general up next is the pulley bow the pulley bow does physical damage and is the heaviest bow in Elden ring weighing five it requires 11 strength and 11 dexterity in order to use effectively the pulley bow is fantastic it has the best range of all bow type weapons in Elden ring it has the lowest requirements of all bows and has the highest damage on average of all bows however you don't get it until the mount galmore area of the game and it's the heaviest bow in Elden ring scaling wise Dex is just ever so slightly ahead of strength making it perfectly viable for both types of builds and it does have the best scaling of all bows so investing points is definitely worth it up next is the ER tree bow the UR tree bow does physical and holy damage and is tied for the second lightest bone Elden ring weighing four it requires eight strength 12 dexterity and 14 faith in order to use effectively the UR tree bow is interesting because it does increased damage with both fire and golden arrows due to Faith scaling though performs much better with golden arrows than fire and this damage is higher than any other bow and Elden ring when only using golden arrows the downside is that you cannot find this weapon until the lendo Royal Capital holy damage is resisted by a lot of endgame bosses and when you don't use fire or golden arrows this bow deals the lowest Perot damage of any bow in Elden ring scaling wise it scales best up to 80 Faith with minimum points and strength and dexterity making it perfect for Faith builds that spellcast wanting a long range way of picking off enemies this also allows you to use Golden bow flame grant me strength or how of shi easily further increasing your damage and lastly we come to the Alban Arc bow the Alban Arc bow does physical damage and is tied for the second heaviest bow in L ring wi 4.5 requires seven strength and 18 dexterity in order to use effectively the Alban Arc bow is often overlooked by many wouldbe bow users and that's probably because you cannot get it until the consecrated snowfields and it can take some time to farm however it has the highest damage of any bow that can use rain of arrows and it has the highest base damage of all bows so it doesn't rely as much on scaling as the pulley bow the scaling of this weapon is mostly decks making this arguably the best choice of bow when playing a deck's build if you don't want to use Mighty shot or BR and this brings us to Great bows great bows have the highest attack rating of all bow type weapons they're the only weapon type that can use through and through they can all be found in the first half of the game and they're tied with bows for the longest range of all bow type weapons the negatives of this weapon group are that they're much heavier than other bow type weapons in some cases wearing double or triple they have the longest draw time of all the bow type weapons they have a very limited weapon skill selection there's only two that you can use and their ammo capacity is about a third of what other bow type weapons have so let's get into the great bows themselves first is the her tree great bow the UR tree great bow does physical and holy damage and is the second heaviest great bow and Elden ring weighing 11 and it requires 20 strength 14 dexterity and 14 faith in order to use effectively just remember that you only need 2/3 the strength value in order to use any bow type weapon so this would be 14 in this case the UR tree great bow is by far the worst of the great bows except when using golden great arrows and when using the sacred scorpion charm and holy shouting crack tier alt together this combo allows it to catch up to the great bow and line great bow and per Arrow damage but you have to have these things to pull this off however you can get this great bow earlier than any other great bow in the game it has the lowest requirements of all great bows and Native faith scaling allows you to buff with golden vow easily pushing your damage up to the Golem great bow when using it through and through is not likely to benefit you as much with this weapon is the damage is much lower than other great bows particularly since 9fp is not a small amount early game I don't recommend using it if you've grabbed this bow early on but if you're later in the game and have more FP and proper spacing you definitely should when need it this weapon scales better with faith up to 50 then strength and then dexterity making this a good pairing with strength Faith builds and golden gr Arrow scale with faith so should prioritize this before strength Additionally the scaling of this weapon is poor in general compared to other great bows so you shouldn't focus on increasing your stats to maximize its damage or rather on what other weapon you're using next is the great bow itself the great bow deals physical damage and it's the second lightest great bow in Elden ring weighing 10 it requires 20 strength and 20 dexterity in order to use effectively the great bow is not the worst gra bow even though it deals less damage than all but the Earth tree gra bow however it can be infused with rain of arrows if you don't like through and through and does slightly less damage than redon's rain when fully buffed but slightly more damage when not buffed with exalted flesh or flame gra me strength through and through does about 30% more damage for 9 FP which I covered earlier which is not a terrible trade if you have the time and FP to use it as it takes a bit longer to set up than a normal shot on a great bow the damage through and through deals on the great bow is about 15% less than the Golem great bow does when using the same weapon skill and about the same as the urry great bow does when using the same weapon skill when using the sacred scorpion charm fully shrouding crack tier and golden great arrows on that weapon the great bow has the same scaling for both strength and dexterity allowing you to use it in either type of build effectively but getting the most damage out of it requires a quality Bill next is the Golem great bow the Golem great bow does physical damage and is the heaviest gra bow in Elden ring weighing a whopping 14.5 it requires 24 strength and 18 dexterity in order to use effectively the Golem great bow is the pound-for-pound King of Great bows if you're talking about per shot damage or through and through damage and you can also get it rather early on in the game by farming golems that use bows in limr however it is the heaviest great Bow by a good margin making it hard to use early on when trying to manage your weight through and through does more damage with this weapon than any other great bow but the downside is that you cannot change to rain of arrows when you want for certain bosses or enemies this means if you like rain of arrows you should either use the great bow or line grao despite their lower Perot damage this weapon scales varies slightly better with strength and dexterity making it viable for both types of builds however to get the most from this weapon you'll need to go the quality route so keep in mind when using this since it has the best scaling of all bow type weapons in Elden ring you definitely should consider doing this when using this weapon and finally we come to the lion great bow the lion great bow does physical damage and is the lightest great bow in Elder ring wing 9.5 requires 22 strength and 18 dexterity in order to use effectively the lion great bow is solid it has excellent base damage and scaling considering it's the lightest great bow and it visually looks better than the other three great bows it also natively increases redon's spear damage by 20% and if you hold a second line great bow in your off hand you can double this bonus redon's rain is a solid weapon skill and can hit for over 3K damage when fully buffed and using redon Spears as ammo it's great for Co-Op when someone has a boss distracted or for leading off a fight against difficult enemies that haven't seen you yet it's easily the best weapon skill of great bows typically being slightly better than rain of arrows when fully po the L Gra B has nearly identical scaling with strength and dexterity making it viable for both types of builds but just like the Golem great bow you'll need to build for Quality if you want to get the most damage from it and it does have relatively good scaling so putting points for damage is worth it and the last thing I want to cover before we wrap up this video is talismans that work with bows there are a staple group of talismans that work with bows that I'm going to go through and these are the arrow sting Talisman which increases the damage that your arrows deal this is pretty much a must have on any bow build as it's going to and just give you a 10% increase in damage so if you're playing a bow build you'll absolutely want to have this one equipped the arrows reach Talisman increases the range of your weapon now what I find is that if you're using a light bow this is pretty much a must have unless you're using the black bow which again is not a light bow but has double the range or almost double the range of a light bow so if you're using the black bow you probably don't need to use the arrows reach Talisman but if you're using any light bow you should should definitely have this one on it or you'll probably see a notice will drop off in your damage I don't think the arrows reach Talisman is needed on any bow that has 50 range particularly if you're using Mighty shot on that bow cuz that will extend the range of that particular shot anyway so I think you can fill this slot with something else unless you're you know going for very very longdistance shots ritual sword Talisman increases your attack power by 10% when you're at full health this also applies to Bow attacks so this is pretty much a staple is also a staple in Mage builds for the same reason just giving you that 10% increase in damage Shard of Alexander or Warrior jar Shard will boost the damage of your weapon skills and since you typically use weapon skills a lot on bows and there are few talism that increase your damage on bows this is definitely one that you should consider using on any bow Bill the blue dancer charm can also increase your attack power the lower your equip load is so if you want to play a very light mobile bow build to try and maximize your damage with the least amount of protection you can absolutely use the blue dancer charm and lastly the spear Talisman increases piercing damage against enemies that are attacking you really the best time to use this in my opinion is if you're using a light bow and you bait an enemy into attacking you and you jump and shoot them or roll and shoot them while their mid attack animation so definitely consider this on any light bow build and maybe you know other builds as well where you tend to hit enemies that are attacking you but generally this will be light bow builds and keep in mind this only applies to physical damage so if you're using this you should be using physical damage arrows so that wraps up our video on light bows bows and great bows I hope you guys learned something this was a ton of fun to do there was a lot to this one sorry it took so long I will be doing another video on staffs and another video on seals going through the break points on where they shine scaling wise when you might consider using each staff and obviously we'll work in some more builds as well and we'll do some more coverage also other videos leading up to the launch of shatter the Earth Tree in just over two weeks as always if you guys have further tips for bow users if there's something I forgot to mention or if you have questions please leave them in the comments below [Music] [Music] w
