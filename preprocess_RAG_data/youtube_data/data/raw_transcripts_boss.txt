Transcript Text:
the ronaldo fight can be very difficult if you're not prepared and is probably one of the more difficult fights in the game particularly early on if you're not sure what to do and if you're not set up properly in phase one the strategy is really simple you want to find the student with a sort of glowing uh or around them hit them one time move to the next one hit them one time move the next one hit them one time look out for the books flying at you if you're not sure where one of them is this is a good tell where they are and you can also hear the singing if you have like a headset or something that has surround so you can sort of see the direction the strategy here is that you don't want to kill anything more than you have because basically it picks a person randomly one of these students randomly to get that aura and if you kill them all then it'll start putting them like in the corners or on the very sides and edges of the room and you have to go chase it down possibly getting hit by a lot of things in the process so just hit it once break that aura and as soon as you've done that three times get prepared for an all of the drop and you want to get at least half of her health and so you only have to do this two times go as hard as you can buff your weapon right before she drops you usually have about five seconds and go as hard as you can and try and get half that health all you gotta do is get half and then repeat this process and get half again if you're too slow doing this uh after you get a certain amount of her health off she'll start casting spells at you from the middle of the room so you want to do it quickly as possible so that you don't have to deal with that in the second phase things get a little bit hairy and it can be really really difficult what i recommend doing is summoning the wolf spirit ashes the reason for this is because she staggers basically off any hit and between the three wolves and yourself you can just keep your chain staggered a lot of the time if you can get up on her and just try and position yourself so that the wolves are on one side and you're on the other and you just keep spamming away don't worry about taking damage don't worry about her hitting you at all just keep spamming until your salmon is exhausted let some regenerate keep attacking and keep chasing her down and dodging her spells being really really aggressive is the best strategy here and it might take you a few tries because you're being so aggressive but it is much better than the alternative what can make this second part so difficult is that she can fire spells off at you like multiple at a time where you're trying to dodge one and you get hit by another one you need to pay very close attention particularly if you're using spirit summons or if you're co-opting who she has aggro on so that you're not the one getting targeted by a spell when you don't think that you are and you just get one-shotted from the side of the screen a couple other tips if you're playing a mage this can be extremely difficult because she's magic resistant so using magic or magic damage is not advised and if you have a melee weapon upgraded if you're playing some sort of spellblade or if you don't you should probably upgrade a melee weapon and what you want to do is you want to put bloody slash on that you can get bloody slash on that from uh eastern lim grave from fort height go pick that up slot it onto your weapon upgrade that thing to like plus six and just spam it two-handed and just spam r1 that is the best strategy if you're a mage it's a really good strategy even if you're not a mage she's really really susceptible to bleed holy also seems to work well on her so if you have holy damage that's fantastic but if you're playing a mage you're gonna have to kind of go out of your comfort zone and do something a little bit different to get through this fight also make sure in phase two that when you summon your spirit ashes you dodge the beam that comes at you first don't just get into phase two summon your spirit ashes get hit in the face die and that's the end of the fight wait for her beam dodge it and then summon your spirit ashes also one last tip is it's really good to just stock fully up on hp uh flask for this fight you don't really need mana at all you don't really need magic unless you have some sort of weapon art that takes a ton of fp that is really really damaging you you can just stack health fast that way you can survive and this really helps if you're co-opting as well because if you're a co-operator and you get summoned you're gonna have half your health last so if you had like six or something that would give you three three is better than two so stack health flasks [Music] me [Music] you

the magma worm fight can be pretty tough most people are going to be doing this probably a little earlier than they should in order to get the moonville katana but i'm going to walk you through what worked for me during this video first off sometimes you sort of see him raise up if he gets fire in his mouth and then he's going to charge forward he may even turn around and do this a couple times in a row so during this phase he's going to spit magma all over the floor and all you really want to do is wait for this to stop and stay clear of the magma and wait for the magma to clear during this part you're going to be really defensive and you're just going to try and stay alive and not worry about dealing damage also sometimes he'll sort of raise up again and get fire in his throat he raises his head a lot higher when he does this and he's going to shoot a fireball at you you want to be ready to dodge this it's pretty easy to read if you see him raise up with fire in his throat he's either gonna charge you or shoot a fireball so in either case you're gonna be dodging to the side to get the hell out of the way in order to get near him you usually have to roll through a big wind-up attack so make sure you're ready to do that make sure you don't roll too early because they do have a very long wind up get near his back legs and start attacking and really what you need to do and what you need to pay attention for when you get there is for any time he does sort of any animation get ready to dodge usually he'll do like a slam which you can dodge and then there's also like a tail whip he'll do like a lot of the dragons in the game and you need to be on the lookout for that tail whip it has a really really long wind up so you should be able to tell it's coming you usually only get in about two or three maybe four attacks at most before you have to dodge for quite a while so be patient with this fight don't try and be hyper aggressive or it'll get you killed and make sure you keep your health topped up because a lot of these attacks are one shots if you get in the wrong place another thing you want to be on the lookout for is sometimes he'll lift up and breathe lava on his side like back behind him a little ways he can do this on either side of him so it doesn't matter which side you stand on but if he breathes fire on the side that you're on you need to get the hell out of there real quick but if you breathe fire on the other side this is a fantastic opportunity to get in some shots while he's stuck in that animation you can see i make a lot of mistakes during this video and i'm still able to get them down at my level which is probably a little bit lower than you'd normally be when you get here just by keeping my health topped up and not being too greedy i misread some of the attacks but even misreading some of them as long as you have enough potions to keep your health up and you don't get in a bad spot with the magma you're usually okay [Music] hey [Music] [Music]

Video ID: qRK7p6NUlpE
Transcript Text:
the crucible knight is not an easy boss in elden ring and it's one that can be difficult no matter whether you're a melee character or a ranged character and in this video i'm gonna go through the strategies for either type starting with range character first if you're playing a bow user you're gonna have a difficult time with this boss unless you're using something like a short bow where you can dodge an attack quickly in the same motion uh his shield is going to block almost all your damage all the time so you're not going to be able to get too many shots in him with bow but if you're playing a magic user you can actually do chip damage through his shield and in fact i highly recommend stacking your flasks like all the way to the mana side of things and just spamming uh through his shield even when he's blocking because you can actually with away a good amount of his health even when he's just holding up his shield but beyond that the things you need to look out for are when he does his sort of stomp and hits in an aoe in the ground in front of him and comes after you need to make sure you roll out of this otherwise it's kind of an instant kill otherwise you're just going to try and create separation when you're playing range beta's attacks uh when he gets close roll away and keep spamming spells trying to hit him when his shield is like lowered like while he's in an attack animation if possible but if not just spamming away into his shield from a distance when he gets to phase two things get considerably more difficult playing as a mage because he gets more aggressive and it's harder to keep your separation and there are also new attacks you need to look out for mainly his tail swipe don't get hit by that sometimes he'll do a tail swipe and then an even longer reaching double tail swipe so you gotta be careful of that and i like to dive roll through his charge attack when he raises up into the air this puts you as far away from him as possible enabling you to continue spamming away spells in a distance [Music] [Music] now if you're playing a melee build things get a little more tricky as you're not just be able to sit back at range and range him down you need to bait his attack animations uh ideally there's a couple that are really good if he does the shield charge at you he's usually vulnerable for a couple seconds afterwards where you can get an attack or two and then roll away and most of his attacks are very slow meaning that you should be able to dodge through them uh and get to them rather easily the main one you need to be look out for again is that aoe stomp he does in front of him if he catches you in this you're pretty much toast [Music] so again when he gets to phase two you gotta be on the lookout for that tail swipe you might forget about it if you're attacking in melee range because he tends to do it as a reaction to some of your attacks so you got to be careful and you can't just hack away even it looks like his back is to you because he can just tail swipe you and always be prepared again to dodge a second time dodge the first tail swipe wait to see if he's gonna do a second and then dodge again don't just dodge the first tail swipe and then begin attacking again unlike while playing a ranged character if you're playing melee when he charges at you i like to dodge to the side or sometimes even backward in order to put myself as close to him as possible when he lands is he doesn't be he's not very aggressive the second he lands you don't usually do like a tail whip not long after that but if you position yourself well you might be able to get a running an attack first other than that it's just kind of rinse and repeat this strategy baiting his slow attacks reading his tail whips and then dodging the charge attack [Music] hey [Music] bye

Title: Astel Naturalborn of the Void Boss Guide - Elden Ring Astel Naturalborn of the Void Boss Fight
Video ID: dzrSCDUcFys
Transcript Text:
in this video i'm going to be showing you my natural born of the void boss strategy so if you've been stuck on this boss watch on to find out what i do to get me through it so first off as the fight starts out you're going to have to dodge his laser beam pretty self-explanatory but i like to run towards the boss at kind of like a medium pace the reason for that is you can actually bait his tail attack where he like attacks with his tail and then a second time if you don't get close to him too fast and you want to be able to do that because this will give you an opportunity to buff like right under his tail if you get in close enough just make sure that you're not getting hit or you know get some spells off like i like to use like my dragon breath spell here or something that maybe has a longer animation so that you're ready to go immediately afterward there's really only a few things you need to look out for during this fight first of all if you see him do any sort of swipes at you he usually leaves a trail of purple magic afterward so you either want to roll through that if you're standing on top of that swipe or if you're at mid range you want to roll backward wait for the magic to explode and then get back into close range periodically he'll raise up into the air and then slam down the best thing to do here is just move forward roll forward let it go over you turn around and start striking him be on the lookout when this happens though a lot of times if you're going ham on him he'll like raise up in the air and put his hands down in the ground and start doing these like purple waves that are on the ground you can roll backwards to avoid him but if you get stuck in like a long animation like if you're using a weapon art you're probably gonna take damage to make sure not to go too crazy at this point periodically during the fight he's going to teleport and always look left immediately when you see this teleport happen because sometimes he'll come and try and grab you and it's basically a one-shot attack if he grabs you so always look left that grab always seems to come from the left for me so if you look left immediately and you see him coming for you make sure you dodge quickly out of the way and if you look left immediately you don't see him then he's probably behind you somewhere and you've got plenty of time to turn around and find him before sort of rinsing and repeating the beginning strategy dodge the beam beat the tail attack etc sometimes he'll sort of raise up and like all this purple mist will come on the string and he'll call like these meteors down what i found that works best during this phase is just move left and just start dodge rolling as soon as you start seeing those meteors come out at like 99 of the time you'll they'll either land in your iframes or they won't hit you at all and that's just a really easy way to handle that aspect of this fight those are really the main things in this fight you need to look out for having a little bit of range like if you have any ranged magic at all is good or if you have like throwing something or you know if you have like a bow um any of those can really help in like the mid-range situations because when you get close to him he tends to do melee attacks but those are not hard to read you can generally roll through them and get behind him if you're playing a pure melee build the ones i mentioned before are really the attacks that you need to look out for in this fight [Music] hey [Music] [Music]

Title: Valiant Gargoyle Boss Guide - Elden Ring Valiant Gargoyle Boss Fight
Video ID: LeO0V0CSuFI
Transcript Text:
in the cellaring video i'm gonna be showing my strategy for the valiant gargoyle fight this is a rather difficult fight depending on what your setup is and you're gonna see this is a rather long video because i don't exactly have the ideal setup for this fight however it will give me a chance to showcase a lot of the attacks and explain how to handle them so that's great first up let's talk about the valiant gargoyle itself in my opinion it's a lot easier to attack the valiant gargoyle when he has his axe out rather than his swords a lot of time his attacks with his swords are very erratic they're a lot faster attacks and the ones with his axes are slower and they're more predictable and usually you can just stay under his feet when his axe is out and you can pretty much dodge just about anything just by even just staying there even if you don't dodge roll out of the way you're generally not going to get hit by most of the attacks when the axe is out which just isn't the case with the swords a lot of times when his swords are out you're gonna have to like dodge roll forward and stay as close to him as a can as you can so that the attacks go over your head another really good attack that he does when his axe is out is the one where he races up in the air and then charges at you like plummets down this is a very easy one to read and roll through at the last second in order to get some damage in so you always want to make sure that you're getting damage in there if you can it should be you know if you've done this fight a few times and you're struggling that's definitely one you want to look for you want to be ready for because you can get in some free damage there just about every time so i highly recommend during this fight you know trying to range him when he's using his swords if you can or if you have a shield approach cautiously and attack with your shield up i use barricade shield a lot in this but if you don't have it you're not gonna be able to block every attack so you know it's a lot easier to block the sword attacks than the axe once and what you really want to look out for is when he changes weapons anytime you see these like sparks come out where he's like reaching for his back or something like that he's changing weapons and you want to recognize when he's changing weapons because you never want to be near him when he's changing weapons if possible because he usually does some sort of swipe attack it doesn't matter whether he has the axe or the swords and the timing on these depending on which weapons he you know switches to is different so if you think you got the timing down for one weapon it's not the same for the other and also you need to recognize this this is a good time to learn to recognize this animation because when you get to the phase two and there are two gargoyles when they're swapping weapons is a great time to get in some damage if he ever does the poison breath attack in phase one all you need to do is just run away and wait for him to come to you keep in mind that this animation although it looks like it's gonna go longer than it does he can sometimes just snap break out of and get aggroed onto you really really fast so if you don't get out of it very quickly and you're trying to like drink a health potion um just be careful because if you might get hit if you're not fast enough so the general strategy for phase two is that you obviously want to finish off the weaker of the two valiant gargoyles the one without the twin blade and here is where i switched to ranged attacks if your character doesn't have a ranged option you're going to have a very difficult time with this fight unless you have very very high dps the reason for this is if you're up close fighting the gargoyle while the other gargoyle is off your screen you don't know what he's doing a lot of times he's casting poison into you that'll kill you really fast if you're not looking for it or you might just fly in with an attack from off screen and kill you in one or two hits so it's very difficult to face him in melee here particularly when you know you may have to dodge multiple attacks in a row from two different enemies so if you have any sort of ranged option this is where i like to kite around and try and range down that target even if it's not like a ton of damage you can see in the video here my lightning sphere isn't hitting for that much damage but i'm eventually able to get him down again as i mentioned with the swapping of weapons animation where the sparks coming out uh this is a very good time in the space to get in some range damage as soon as you see those sparks on the target that you're facing start flinging spells or projectiles if you're using a bow or whatever atom because you can usually get in one or two hits or if you need to take a potion that's a good time to do it as well also if you're using spirit summons for this fight i highly recommend using them during the transition from phase one to phase two when the two girls girls come out make sure that you have very very tanky summons here or something that's gonna stay far away from the boss because you want one to hold aggro as long as possible while you go ham on the other one and you don't want it to die any quicker than it has to because that'll give you more time so make sure you have a very tanky summons and make sure you upgrade them if you need to so the twin blade gargoyle assuming you got the other one down is definitely the harder of the two his attacks are more erratic and it makes it hard to stay close to but again just like the gargoyle before you either want to be directly under his feet rolling forward through his attacks and getting in some attacks or you want to be as far away as you can just like the other gargoyle 2 you want to be on the lookout for when he swaps weapons this is a great time to get some damage in depending on where you are if you're close to him when he swaps to his axe from his twin blade you can actually get under his feet really quickly and you'll be able to get in some shots really easily because he does like two overhead attacks in a row you just need to be careful after that because sometimes he'll do an attack where he like drags his axe behind him for a second and if you're behind him or in his feet it may clip you while he's dragging it along the ground and hit you under your shield or something one attack that you want to be on the lookout for is where he starts like twirling his blade and there's like wind build up and then he sort of like jumps at you the best thing i found to do when this happens is unlock from him real quick if you're target locked and then just run and dive forward when he jumps at you if you're locked onto him and you hit dodge after your camera angle spins around you'll actually roll into his attack and you'll take damage but if you roll forward he'll jump past you so make sure you unlock real quick roll forward and then turn around and re-lock on and lastly the attack that you really want to be on the lookout for here is where he like roars and sort of has this like whitish glow around him he usually goes a little bit berserk when this happens and he'll slam his axe down doing huge aoe damage so you don't want to be anywhere near that when possibly either be directly under his legs so that it goes over you or you want to be as far away as possible but i don't recommend trying to like roll through that attack and get to him if you're sort of mid-range nice

Title: Bloodhound Knight Darriwil Boss Guide - Elden Ring Bloodhound Knight Darriwil Boss Fight
Video ID: cmtkAyLTHt0
Transcript Text:
bloodhound knight darewell can be a very challenging fight for both ranged and melee characters and in this video i want to go over the strategies that i found work best for both of those scenarios if you're playing a ranged character like if you're using a bow or you're using uh spells it can be kind of difficult because he tends to dodge your projectiles but if you have something like glenstone phalanx for instance it works really well during this boss fight because he is really aggressive and they tend to dodge into those projectiles really easily and what's really great about that spell is it allows you to dodge away while hitting him at the same time so it's a really good spell for this fight so i highly suggest if you're a mage character you get that and if you're a bow character you're gonna or a ranged character that uses you know some other sort of ranged weapon you're gonna have to learn how to dodge away from his attacks and then fire while he's in his attack animation and fight similarly to the way you would fight if you're doing a melee character so there are a couple attack patterns that you need to look out for because these are going to be your best openings the first one is where he drags his claw along the ground and he comes at you and sort of swings upward roll away at this moment he jumps up into the air and plunges down on you you can actually roll toward him with i-frames and get in position to get in a couple of attacks right when he lands if you time this properly you want to try and punish this attack every time it happens it's your safest form of damage during this fight another combo you want to be on the lookout for is his three hit attack where he does a slash with a sword one way holds for a second slashes the other way and then comes down with a third hit that's overhead and plunges it into the ground if you can read this attack well you can actually get in an attack at the end of this but you have to be careful because sometimes he'll do a leaping fourth attack that he adds on to the end and if you're not ready for it and you don't have good reflexes you might get hit by that fourth attack regardless whether you're going to attack or not during this attack pattern you need to learn to read it because if you charge in when he does just one swipe you're gonna get hit by that second swipe or if you run in when he does two swipes you're gonna get hit by that overhead if you're not paying attention so if you're not sure what to do just wait for that drag claw attack and get that opening then if you can in phase two another really good opening is he will charge at you with his sword dragging along the ground you'll see the spark similarly to when he does the claw as well this is another good opportunity to get in some shots it's difficult to read when you first see it because you know it's coming but the timing of the dodge might be a little bit later than you're anticipating you might have a tendency to dodge a little bit too early and then get hit when the sword comes out of the ground so make sure you wait till the last minute and then you can punish this attack as well other than these few attacks i highly advise just dodging when he does other attack animations because they can be erratic and harder to time and if you stick to these ones you should be alright [Music] [Music] [Music]

Video ID: L41VibGKQkA
Transcript Text:
for the knights cavalry bosses the tactics are going to be a little bit different depending on which boss you're fighting because they use different weapons that have slightly different move sets but the general concept is the same i like to do this fight on foot i find it to be much easier and straightforward no matter whether you're a mage character or you know a melee character um if you're a mage character you know you can use a spell that does melee damage or you can use a melee weapon that's got some sort of ashes that does magic damage but what you want to do is basically bait the attack on his side get him to do some sort of attack at you roll through it get in a couple shots on the side of the horse wait for him to turn around charge at you again and sort of repeat this process it may take you a couple times once you you know start get into the flow of it but you start to recognize the pattern and its attacks are actually really easy to dodge if you end up doing enough damage to the horse you'll actually knock him off and if you lock on to him and press r1 really quickly you can actually do like a plunging attack into his chest with your weapon and that will deal mega damage usually killing him outright if not being very close you can then fight him on foot he has very very slow attacks but if you back away too far or wait too long he'll get back on the horse but at that point he should be very very low in health anyway and you can sort of just repeat this process if you have a shield when he charges at you you can try blocking if you have enough stamina uh in order to you know just absorb the blow but his attacks hit really hard so i advise just rolling through it trying to stay as close to him with that role as you can attacking and then rolling away just repeating this process again the main tactic here is just waiting for him to come to you baiting an attack rolling close to him attacking and then rolling away me [Music] [Music]

Title: Leonine Misbegotten Boss Guide - Elden Ring Leonine Misbegotten Boss Fight
Video ID: C_1OjdPNqPk
Transcript Text:
so leon and miss begotten fight can be one of the most challenging fights early on in eldon ring and in this video i want to show you my strategy for getting through that now the strategy is pretty similar no matter whether you're playing range for melee here because the guy is so aggressive you basically have to roll or block a lot and get great separation if you're ranged or you know get in close and melee if you're a melee character having a shield for this fight helps tremendously but his attacks deal so much stamina damage that unless you use barricade you're probably not going to be blocking much so probably most characters are going to opt to roll through his attacks and try and you know dodge out of the way and then get in some shots both of these are viable strategies but just keep in mind that you're probably going to be dodging more than blocking unless you're using barricade his swings tend to be horizontal for the most part and very erratic which means that you have to time your dodges really well i feel like dodging forward more than dodging backward works far more often because he tends to be aggressive and go through you so if you dodge forward you have less of an area that you can get hit from but you also need to be on the lookout for his jump sometimes he'll jump up into the air and you need to make sure that you time your rolls when this happens so that you catch the iframes in the roll and if you're melee you're rolling towards him to get some shots and when he lands and if you're ranged you're rolling away from them to create separation to get in shots with your bow or with your magic spells also if you're a magic user for this fight having the glenstone failing spell the one with the daggers floating above your head works really well because he's really aggressive and that spell works really really well against aggressive enemies you also want to pay particular attention to his like sort of three-hit combo where he goes swipes wing and then raises his sword over his head and sort of spins trying to track you and comes down with his sword that attack right there if you can sidestep that last swing where he comes down vertically gives you a huge opening to get in massive damage also be on the lookout for his stomp abilities sometimes he'll sort of stomp and then he'll like swing his sword around like heavily you want to be careful because if you get caught in that it's very very hard to dodge but again i recommend dodging forward rather than dodging backward most of the time through that because it tends to spin through you but you want to be careful when he does that stomp and you don't either want to be close or you want to roll through if you're already too close hey [Music] [Music] bye [Music]

Title: Flying Dragon Agheel Boss Fight Guide - Elden Ring Boss Fight
Video ID: 4AiJx946HCE
Transcript Text:
in this video i'm gonna be showing you how i defeated flying dragon and heal it was actually a relatively easy strategy you can die probably a time or two doing it because it's a little bit rng based but it's actually really really simple and i'm just gonna explain it to you real quick it doesn't matter what your build is for this fight the strategy is more or less the same whether you're a mage or an archer or a faith wielder or melee character it's basically the same no matter which you are the first thing i like to do before getting into this is i like to allocate all my flasks to health because you simply don't need any uh mana for this fight no fp so make sure you have all the health flasks you can get that way if you do make a couple mistakes you can just heal up and keep going so the strategy is just really really simple really you're just going to use torrent and you're going to ride at him full speed and you're just going to keep riding through him and attacking his wings when possible or his legs just dodging his tacks when you see him raise up in the air get the hell out of there he usually does a fire breath attack or he just dives at you if you see him raise up in the air you try and get a read on what he's doing a fire starts coming down right a different direction but if he's just hovering in the air he's gonna dive at you so riding directly at him is the best strategy there because you'll fly over your head if you try and ride away the opposite direction of him when he's just hovering in the air not doing anything when he lands he's gonna hit right in the back of you for major damage so when he lands coming out of the air you're just gonna ride towards him sometimes he does fire breath when this happens and you sort of need to arc around the fire breath going left or right depending on where you are on the map get back to him and repeat this process really the only challenging thing about this strategy is if you have a short-reaching weapon it can be hard to hit his legs or his arms um and managing your stamina keep in mind that every time you boost torrent with circle or b button on xbox you're using stamina and every swing you do uses stamina so if you need a boost and you're out of stamina you you can't get it so if he's about to step on you and you can't boost out of the way then you're gonna take damage but you should have plenty of healing flasks so that shouldn't be a problem to heal through if that happens a time or two you can do this strategy even if you don't have a very high upgraded weapon even if you have like a plus one plus two weapon and low stats this strategy is very very simple because you simply generally don't get hit it may take you five minutes to do because your damage is low but it's very very hard to get hit if you learn to read the attacks and it's not really hard to read them at all [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] bye [Music] [Music]

the royal night loretta boss fight is easy or difficult depending on your setup and you're going to notice immediately that she has a similar move set to the tree sentinel or knights cavalry because she's on horseback and you're going to recognize a lot of those same moves right away so you should be familiar with how to dodge her melee attacks just generally the difficulty is that she's also casting spells against you like limb blade failings that track you and are going to try and hit you while you're trying to dodge away from these melee attacks so you have to be very careful about your dodges and why strategy would i do for this generally is i'm either really really aggressive and just stay up on the front of the horse i feel like the front of the horse is the safest place um or i wait for her you know glint blade phalanx spell to miss me and then try and get into melee range and attack and wait for her range projectiles to miss me her to close into melee range and then sort of attack if that's the strategy you're employing then the main thing you want to be careful of is that when you get into melee range not being too aggressive if you're gonna you know play the weight and try and dodge the projectiles and then get into melee range and then attack again you won't be able to go ham here because she's going to attack like three or four times in a row if you do this and you'll generally get one or two shot depending on what your health is so you're not gonna be able to go crazy with that strategy but i highly recommend if you have any sort of weapon with any stagger even if it's just like a charged r2 you get to the front of the horse after dodging projectiles try and stay there if possible and just attack attack attack as much as you can even trading damage because you can speed this fight up tremendously if you can just get damage off probably the hardest part about this fight is actually getting damage on the boss because she moves around so much and because she throws their spells up so much it's suicide to run in there when she has her you know glen blade phalanx up and you're in melee range because you're not going to be able to attack through the glint blade phalanx and her melee attacks really the only other things that make this fight difficult are the fact that she'll start throwing projectiles at you while glint blade phalanx is up and you'll have to dodge multiple projectiles in the second half of the fight and if you don't dodge that loretta's great bow spell you're pretty much one-shotted so make sure you dodge that the timing is not too hard on that but sometimes if she has other spells up it can make it incredibly difficult which is another reason i recommend staying at the front of the horse when possible because i don't think she does that spell if your point blank range as often [Music] [Music] [Music]

Title: Red Wolf of Radagon Boss Guide - Elden Ring Red Wolf of Radagon Boss Fight
Video ID: bZcgW0gQE48
Transcript Text:
for the red wolf ratigan fight there are really just a couple attacks you need to be on the lookout for the first one is when he puts up the arrows that kind of home on to you he usually charges through you right after summoning him so you have to time your roll so that you not only roll through him or away from him but also dodge the arrows in the process it can be very very tough too sometimes rng is not on your side when that happens and it can get you killed but you want to make sure that you're timing your roll so that you dodge both of those things if possible the other attack you want to be on the lookout for is where he sort of leaps into the air with the sword and then plunges down on top of you this is a great opportunity to get in some damage roll through this attack so you position yourself right next to him or roll away if you're a ranged character and then go to town on him for a few swings before getting ready to dodge or block if you're using a shield if you're using a shield for this fight i highly recommend barricade shield as it'll reduce the amount of stamina you consume when blocking and you can block a lot of his sword sweeps its physical damage so it you'll block 100 of that damage and it'll leave you in an opportunity to get an attack sometimes not all the time and you can use block counter as well if you can pull it off the main strategy or the main thing to look out for is that most of his attacks are two or three hit combos he never does generally like one single attack except for that jumping attack so if you see him leap at you and you start to swing be prepared for a second attack from him or a third attack and he attacks faster than you so you're gonna get hit make sure you wait for at least two attacks before you swing and three if you know if you want to be really really cautious just to note here about range builds as well he tends to dodge the projectiles you fire if you use like linstone pebble or if you use a bow but he can't jump very far so even though he's dodging some of your projectiles it's still better to just keep firing them off because sometimes you get stuck in a corner and then you'll pummel them with these and that's really the best strategy is keeping your distance and just keep firing away anyway so hey [Music] [Music] [Music]

Title: Margit the Fell Omen Boss Guide - Elden Ring Margit the Fell Omen Boss Fight for Melee and Ranged
Video ID: OXRB6zQem-g
Transcript Text:
in this video i'm going to tell you my strategy is for margaret the fellow men both for ranged and melee characters so first up let's talk about melee what i like to do for this fight as a melee character is summon something like the lone wolves that can distract him for a little while they're not really meant to do damage but just distract him and also chip away at his stagger meter if you didn't know bosses have a staggered meter and every enemy does that after they take a certain amount of damage they stagger allowing you sort of a visceral attack that deals incredible damage so as the wolves chick chip away at him and you swing at him eventually that stagger meter is gonna fill even though you can't see it on the screen and he's gonna get staggered allowing you some free damage a really good strategy for melee characters that don't play defensively that like don't wear a shield or whatever to block attacks and then retaliate after work is to play aggressively and play into this staggered meter if you use again something like the wolves to help speed that up once you stagger him you can get in a lot of damage and i play very very aggressively here as you can see in order to get that stagger meter and i do trade damage a few times because i put quite a few points into health and i have a lot of health blasts his combos are very erratic and hard to read and a lot of times they do uh aoes and they hit in like a 270 degree 180 degree arc so it's very difficult to you know be outside of his hit box even if you're behind him sometimes he turns and hits you if he's like attacking his the wolves or some other spirit ashes so you've got to be prepared to dodge or block depending if you're using a shield or not and you're probably going to have to roll several times wait for his combo to finish and try to get in one or two attacks the best time to get in damage is obviously when he's focused on the wolves get in there when you have an opening preferably at the you know start moving in at the very end of one of his combos or right when he's finished the combo and get in as many attacks as you can as you can see i don't spare any expense just meleeing him uh trying to get that damage in and that stagger meter to film in phase two he sort of pulls out this hammer things get a bit more crazy what you want to look for here is his jump attack where he sort of plummets and smashes the hammer into the ground i roll forward through this attack to position myself right next to him so that i can start meleeing instantly and it pays off both times so you want to learn to time your roll so that you don't take that aoe damage and that you iframe through it and you position yourself right next to the boss so you can attack the second you come out of that role the strategy is a little bit different if you're playing a ranged or uh sorcerer-type build you're gonna want to hang back and use your summons to distract him will you you know range your way at him with your spells or your bow um and then obviously try and dodge his attacks and create separation when he comes at you you're only gonna be able to attack him a few times before he turns around and focuses on you then you're gonna have to dodge for a while and wait for those summons to come back onto him or get his attention again and sort of repeat this process on and off um again when he does that jump attack if you're playing a ranged character instead of rolling through it to position yourself next to him you're going to roll backward to create separation where you can start ranging away where he's recovering from that animation but you get the strategy there so i shall remember [Music] [Music] [Music]

Title: Godrick the Grafted Boss Guide - Elden Ring Godrick the Grafted Boss Fight
Video ID: nl8O2bpSYFA
Transcript Text:
for the godwreck fight there's really a couple of attacks you want to look out for the first one is when he spins wind around him and sort of knocks you backward and then he's either going to do two things if you're somewhat close to him he's going to like wind around and then jump up in the air and try and land on you which you can roll through and attack him which is fantastic opening for you or if you're farther away he's going to shoot projectiles at you which can be really hard to dodge so i recommend just getting outside the wind just a little bit waiting for him to jump on top of you roll and then attacking when you can the other attack you need to be on the lookout for is when he does this five hit combo who sort of raises axe up for a second and then he'll go into this barrage of five hits that have very very long reach a lot of them are vertical and they hit really really hard and they have really strange timings so i recommend just getting as far away when you see this happening as you can because trying to time your rolls is going to be difficult when each swing has different timings ah in phase two he's gonna have a dragon arm on one side and the first thing he's gonna do is breathe fire in a sweeping pattern what you want to do is get as close to him as you can before that fire is just about to hit you and then roll through the fire so if it's coming from your left roll left if it's coming from your right roll right this will usually be your left roll through the fire at the last possible second take like a hard left through it so that when you pop out of your roll you're not standing in fire and then run up to him and attack him if you can that's the strategy you want to use for the fire breath every time you can now he does another fire attack where he like lowers his arm on the ground and breathes fire forward while he walks forward depending on where you're positioned you're gonna do either two things if you're out of position you're just gonna run backward as far as you can until this ends to play it safe and don't take damage but if you're near him you can roll around behind him and then hit him in the back several times while he continues to walk forward gives you a great opportunity to deal some damage he has two other attacks you want to look out for during this phase one is where he like shoots magma around him if this kind of spews out mid-range so if you're close you can stay close and keep attacking him but if you're mid-range you either need to move in close or move far away i recommend moving far away just to be safe but you can do whatever is best for you the other one is where he raises his axe straight up in the air and then slams it down and then slams it down and then slams it down three times when this happens all you need to do is jump just remember that the timings are a little bit different for each slam just jump each one and when the third slam ends hit him a few times you can be standing literally right next to him when this is happening so that the second that third slam is done you can attack him you don't see it here in the video but that's how you need to handle that it's really easy once you get the hang of it i will also make a note here that he seems very very susceptible to bleed i'm using a bleedville in this video so if you're having difficulty try putting an ash of war bloody slash on your weapon and see if that helps you [Music] bye [Music] [Music]

Title: Tree Sentinel Boss Guide: Elden Ring Tree Sentinel Boss Fight for Melee and Ranged Characters
Video ID: QQ8eIzQRQcQ
Transcript Text:
for the tree Sentinel boss fight I actually employ two completely different strategies depending on whether your melee or ranged attack starting with melee first what I like to do is position myself somewhere in his path uh and summon my wolf Spirits again these are not to you know damage him but rather to chip away at him and distract him just to kind of give you some breathing room maybe some time to heal or in order to get his attention for a second while you attack into him and then I like to play pretty aggressively when I get the opportunity so usually what I do is I wait for him to do one of his attacks they usually have pretty big wind ups and they're very easy to read what they're going to do dodging them can be a little bit difficult sometimes but knowing what attack he's going to do is usually pretty easy to read you usually want to dodge through any sort of uh spear attacks or Halbert attacks that he does towards s so that you can get melee attacks and afterward and any sort of Shield attacks he does you normally want to dodge away because they typically have an AOE range that's a lot bigger than it looks and dodging through them is very difficult to do because of that AOE a really good strategy in Elden ring when you're playing melee is to be aggressive I know it sounds strange but on more difficult boss fights being aggressive early on particularly can put you in a really good situation you can often stagger a boss and leave him open to a lot of attacks if you're co-oping or if you're by yourself you can hit him a few times before doing a visceral attack uh and the Wolves help with that by helping fill it stagger meter but also because if you get him under half Health quickly and you barely used any flasks then you have a much higher chance of complet completing the boss fight so the strategy is pretty much rinse and repeat I am really aggressive early on it starts tapering off later once my wolves are toast again another really good reason to be aggressive is you have your spirit summons before they're dead and that's when you want to take full advantage of them if you can then I just bait his attacks roll through when it's a Hirt attack and attack him and then roll away from his shield attacks when I can and that's pretty much this fight in an NHL [Music] now if I'm playing a ranged character if I'm playing like a an Archer or a mage I like to get on horse back keep my distance from them and just shoot spells into them or arrows into them and just keep away it takes a lot longer longer doing it that way but it's a lot safer in my opinion unless you're using like a a mage spell that's a melee spell as well in which case you would play somewhat similarly to the way I play there with the Melee character but one thing to remember is that if you're using magic against this boss sometimes he'll hold his shield up and it'll glow yellow and if you fire projectiles into it they'll actually reflect a huge projectile at you usually one-shotting you so if you see that glowing Shield up if you're a magic user refrain from attacking during that period with spells otherwise you'll just kill yourself and that's pretty much it for the tree Sentinel fight [Applause] [Music] [Music] a he [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] a [Music] w [Music] [Music]

Title: Royal Revenant Boss Guide - Elden Ring Royal Revenant Boss Fight
Video ID: YcKqNNLZFkc
Transcript Text:
the royal revenant boss fight and elder ring can be extremely difficult because of the tight space and how aggressive the enemy is and the fact that he tends to hit you repeatedly and for very very high damage if you're using a shield using barricade shield on your shield can really really help as it'll prevent stamina damage when you get attacked a lot more allowing you to block a lot of his attacks you can even block his entire combo chain if you have enough stamina and you have barricade shield up so i highly suggest using that if you're using a shield if not the best strategy to do which can be kind of hard to pull off is to try and dodge to the side when he lunges forward most of his attacks lunge forward directly so timing your dodge to the side at the last moment should allow you to get to the side of his attacks and behind him and make sure that you uh dodge again if he lunges a second time to the side and be prepared for that and don't just go crazy after dodging a first attack if you're playing some sort of ranged character i highly recommend using spirit ashes for this fight in order to get some separation while he's distracted with your spirit summons which should allow you to get some spells off before you have to dodge a little bit you'll still have to dodge some because he will re-establish aggro on you after you've hit him a few times and repeat the same strategy as mainly trying to dodge to the sides when possible it's easier said than done but waiting for him to get aggro again on the summon ashes before going ham on him again with your spells is the best strategy alternating between dodging left and right uh when he's on you depending on you know where you're standing and letting him reestablish aggro on your spirit summons is definitely crucial if you're playing a ranged character really the only other attack you need to be on the lookout for is his teleport attack generally he'll teleport and somewhere in the room pop up spit poison at you make sure you dodge the poison like left or right it's not too hard to dodge the hard part is establishing like where he teleported to because sometimes it can be directly behind you if you have like a good surround headset or uh you know good speakers you should be able to hear like if it's coming from your left or your right or behind you highly recommend that but otherwise if you don't see him reappear instantly after he teleports it's probably behind you and you can either wait a second and dodge left or right or try and spin around real quick [Music] [Music] bye

Title: Ancient Hero of Zamor Boss Guide - Elden Ring Ancient Hero of Zamor Boss Fight
Video ID: 0e6NkFlCJ80
Transcript Text:
the ancient hero of zamora fight can be kind of difficult if you're a melee character it's much easier if you're a ranged character or a magic wielder particularly in the second stage which is the more difficult of the two in the first phase of this fight the ancient hero sort of hangs back casts magic at you and it's kind of lackadaisical meaning that if you're a melee character you're kind of forced into the position of having to engage the enemy what i found that works best is to sort of engage in hit and run tactics meaning you sprint in when you have an opportunity get one or two hits dodge away and sort of repeat this until you get into phase two that's what worked best for me if you're a ranged character like if you use a bow or if you use magic and you're a mage of some kind or maybe incantations this first phase is actually harder for you in my opinion because he has a tendency to dodge your projectiles over and over and you almost have to wait for him to do an animation until you can get an attack so if you have like a melee spell that you can use that would be good uh or if you're a bow user you sort of need to wait for him to get into an animation before you attack [Music] [Music] [Music] and phase two is where things become much more difficult if you're a mainly character the boss gets really aggressive and comes at you has very long gap closing attacks um and has very erratic attack motions meaning you usually have to dodge not only once but twice in a row in order to avoid the attacks and this is going to be the phase where you can have the most difficulty it's somewhat similar to phase one except in this case you're waiting for the boss to come to you and you are then waiting for him to attack and waiting for his attacks to finish by dodging them or blocking them if you're using a shield and then attacking yourself once or twice and dodging out of there so you it's really the same strategies just kind of in reverse conversely if you're a ranged or melee character you might actually have an easier time in this phase because he does less dodging of projectiles meaning if you have something like glenstone failings for instance that's a really good spell against aggressive enemies because they just run right into the projectiles over and over so you get that thing up he charges that you dodge away it hits him you just repeat this you have an easy piece of time and if you're a bow user you can sort of get in a few shots while he's far away jump away roll away whatever and then sort of repeat this process by keeping your distance from the boss hey [Music] [Music] [Music]

Title: Godskin Noble Boss Guide - Elden Ring Godskin Noble Boss Fight
Video ID: DT_FBpQlPgQ
Transcript Text:
in this godskin noble fight i'm going to be showing you my strategy for defeating the godskin noble this can be an extremely challenging fight if you're a melee build because he doesn't leave a lot of openings to attack and he's very very fast and deals very high damage generally speaking if you're playing a ranged build all you want to try and do is just keep separation from him and keep ranging him down until he gets to phase two there's really not a lot to it other than that you're just gonna keep moving backward dodging his attacks as he does them and keep casting your spells into him you never really have to get near him you know on purpose so you don't really have to learn to read his attacks too much other than just making sure to dodge however if you're playing a melee build getting close to him can be kind of difficult but you do want to try and get close to him as much as you can if you have a shield you want to move in with your shield up otherwise you're gonna have to be even more cautious and play very very carefully as you approach what you want to try and do is bait him into doing his like two-hand slam attack where he slams the butt of his weapon into the ground and then slams it again this leaves you with a good opening to attack him for a couple seconds before getting back away and then sort of moving in again to get an attack he has a lot of attacks that have long animations like if he puts his sword up in the air and he does one long thrust then he's kind of locked into that animation for a second if you dodged through it or dodge to the side and then attack you're in good shape you just got to make sure he doesn't do the variant where he stabs like seven times or something and then he can kill you if you get hit so you just want to keep an eye out make sure which one of those he's doing and act appropriately other than that there really aren't too many openings in phase one to attack him other than maybe if he's throwing a fireball at you if you are backing away to drink a potion he'll generally trigger a fireball so make sure you keep a pillar between you and him if you need to drink a potion and get behind something otherwise you're just gonna take damage in phase two will sort of raise up in the air and then i'll turn on his side and roll at you if you're fighting him and you're gonna going for staggers this is a great opportunity to get in a little extra damage or if you're a ranged character before he starts rolling but what i found best when he starts rolling is to put a pillar between you and him and try and get him stuck on that pillar for the duration of his roll just kind of keep the pillar between you and him so that he cannot run over you it's very very difficult if he gets you know if you're not blocking his path with something to dodge out of the way because he's so wide or to block like it costs a lot of stamina to block that attack and usually even if you block the first one by the time you turn around and he comes back around you won't be able to block the second one and again they're kind of hard to dodge so keeping a pillar between you is the best thing you can do here there's also another attack you want to look out in phase two where he like jumps up in the air like he kind of like knocks you backward with his tummy and then jumps up in the air and lands this is a great opportunity to get in some damage when he lands it's just like other uh boss fights you want to roll through this into him if you're playing melee and then attack him a few times he generally recovers from this a lot faster than you'd think so be careful but that's another good opportunity otherwise it's just rinse and repeat here with the same strategy you've been going for before watching out for these two new attacks the rolling one and the jump in the air and if he does the rolly one again then again you want to get behind a pillar and keep yourself between them [Music] [Music] [Music]

Transcript Text:
for the glenn stone dragon smart boss fight i'm gonna be employing the same strategy that i use for a flying dragon a keel notably riding around on horseback riding through the dragon and hitting him and then repeating this strategy glenstone dragon smart doesn't have too many different attacks than flying dragon and heal maybe his fire attack is a different color and his projectile is a little bit different that he shoots at you instead of fire but otherwise the fight is almost identical so the main things to look out for is when he rises into the air he shoots fire onto the ground you want to get the hell out of there on your horseback and if he rises into the air and then charges you you want to make sure that you ride at him so that he lands over the top of you again the strategy is basically just staying mobile closing the distance to him hitting him in the wings if possible these are very easy targets to hit hitting him as many times as you can and then getting out of there when he races up into the air and then he repositions and you ride back towards him again you may need to ride kind of wide take a wide berth getting back to him one of these breathing projectiles or fire at you when this is happening so you don't ride directly into the flame but you're just going to repeat this process over and over and even if your weapon isn't dealing a ton of damage you usually don't get hit too often but again i like to stack my flasks towards the health side of things for this fight because you really don't need to use any manifest at all so if you do get hit you can use health flasks and sometimes if you get knocked off your horse you might need to consume a health flask in order to get back on torrent which is fine you should have plenty of health classes at this point you're just going to repeat this strategy and you should be able to get them no problem [Music] so [Music] [Music] hey [Music] bye [Music] [Music]

Title: Runebear Boss Guide - Elden Ring Runebear Boss Fight
Video ID: nW97UeBdQDs
Transcript Text:
the room beer fight in elden ring can be extremely difficult when you first get there not only does the boss have huge hit boxes and takes up a massive amount of the space but you're inside a very small space meaning your area to dodge is very limited and even if you can dodge odds are you'll still get clipped by his attacks anyway the best thing i've found for this fight regardless of whether you're arranged or melee is to summon the spirit wolves immediately when you walk in he aggros really quickly so summon them the second you walk through the fog chug a blue pot get your fp back up and get ready to face him wait for the wolves to gain aggro and then if you're a spell caster start casting away or if you're an archer start plugging away and if you're melee start hacking into him a few shots in he's going to turn around and start attacking you and really what you want to go for here is being aggressive you want to try and do as much damage to him as fast as you can even if you trade hits because you really can't dodge and block these attacks and still have stamina left to attack because he's that aggressive so what we're going for here with the wolves and the aggressive approach is actually trying to stagger him before he kills us so you're just going to go ham with the best attacks you have hopefully your wolves are gnawing into him and then he's going to go down and you're going to stab him in the face and then you get an opportunity to heal up and sort of try and repeat this process if you can if you get in trouble just back away keep rolling away and then heal up when you get an opportunity and wait for your wolves to re-establish aggro on them and then go back in and keep attacking hopefully if you don't stagger him on the first round of attacks when you charge in or you start ranging away hopefully you'll stagger him on the second one and you'll be able to drop them and then just repeat that again this is a very difficult fight when you get here because you're not used to in these sort of games being hyper aggressive but it really really pays off in this fight [Music] [Music] [Music]

Title: Dragonkin Soldier Boss Guide - Elden Ring Dragonkin Soldier Boss Fight
Video ID: sxEAktrJFV4
Transcript Text:
the dragonkin soldier boss fight can be extremely challenging because the boss generally one-shots you with most attacks if you don't have enough vigor so make sure if you're having trouble with this fight that you go increase your vigor first and come back having about 20 or so will just prevent you from being one-shotted when you get attacked and make sure you keep your health topped off or have the blessed two talisman in order to keep your health topped off if you chug a pot and you're almost there in order to prevent being one-shotted because in a lot of cases even having 90 of your health is a one-shot if you're a ranged character this fight is pretty easy and it's a complete different strategy than a melee character you can actually just stay on your horse and stay at range and just range him down trying to avoid his attacks when possible um but as a melee character what i found works best is to get as close to him as you possibly can get in some attacks and then if you have a shield and you see him start to do some sort of animation just hold block and more often than not you're okay with the build i'm playing here i'm not really set up to be a block build however i am using barricade shield which helps tremendously to reduce the stamina consumption when blocking so if you have a shield and you're using a shield make sure to get barricade shield for this fight on there it can help out a lot now if you're not using a shield you have to time your dodges which can be very difficult to do because the timing of his attacks is completely different and when you're hugging him up close to his body like that it's hard to tell exactly what attack he's gonna do so your dodge timing is hard to you know it's hard to realize what dodge you need to do when you need to dodge so it's a little bit more challenging if you don't have a shield and in fact you might want to go slap a shield on just for this fight if you're having trouble because it might get you through it where you're having trouble before but again another thing i want to emphasize is that you can see here that i'm playing very defensively and that there's a lot of opportunities i have to attack where my health isn't full and i just keep waiting and waiting for an opportunity to heal first because i know if i get hit once i'm pretty much dead if i'm not at full health so make sure you get your health topped up first that should be priority number one so that if you do take a hit you don't die in one swing if you see him like roar he'll which he'll do when he gets under half health sometimes he's gonna like charge for kind of like you remember some of the bosses from dark souls 3 would do something similar so make sure you avoid that because if you're standing directly in front of him when he does that try and like roll through his legs or something if you can but if you're like a ways back in front of him when he does that you're just going to get plowed over and really the only other attack you need to be on the lookout for is where he like puts his hands down into the ground and then like rips up this has a huge aoe area and if you're standing close to him like i am in the videos you can see i get hit that can almost one shot you or one shot you depending on what your health is so be wary of that it's really hard to see because you're so close to them and that's again another reason that you need to keep your health topped up [Music] [Music] bye

Title: Ancestor Spirit Boss Guide - Elden Ring Ancestor Spirit Boss Fight
Video ID: frtq9y6jMmE
Transcript Text:
for the ancestors spirit boss fight there are only really a few attacks you need to pay attention for the first one is where he's sort of like double or triple jumps up into the air and then plunges down on top of you when he plunges you either want to roll using your iframes to roll through it and get some attacks or roll away if you're a ranged character or you can even block it if you have a substantial shield or if you're using barricade shield usually he immediately rears up afterward and stamps his hooves down in the front so you want to move to the back of him when attacking after this to make sure you don't get hit by that attack periodically he'll raise up into the air and sort of do a breath attack this is very easily avoided all you need to do is back away and wait for it to clear and if you're a ranged character this is a good opportunity to get some damage in probably the most deadly attack that you need to be on the lookout for is where he sort of swings his head back and forth about three times in a row this can consume a lot of stamina if you're trying to block it and not using barricade shield and if you're trying to roll you have to roll basically three times unless you're able to get to the back of him before his third attack comes off so this is the one you really really need to be on the lookout for because if you run out of stamina and get guard broken on that first or second swipe you're gonna get hit really hard by that third attack and it can be really deadly or if you mistime a roll so generally you want to try and stay near his back legs if you get directly behind him he'll sort of do a kick attack and you can either block that a roll that just anticipated if you're directly behind his back but otherwise you want to try and hug his back legs if possible that'll keep you in the safest place [Music] [Music] hey [Music] me [Music] [Music]

the alabaster lord fight is located just after carry a manor so you're going to do that at that point and it's a pretty straightforward fight in my opinion the main things you need to be on the lookout for is when he plunges his sword into the ground and starts shooting like these gravity meteors at you there's a really easy strategy is to just sprint left or right and never stop sprinting and they usually cannot keep up with you and what i like to do is kind of slowly close the gap between me and the boss here while that's happening so that i can get in some melee shots the second it ends he tends to spam the spell over and over so you need to get a good handle on reading it that way you can start evading immediately and you don't get caught by one of those meteors otherwise this melee attacks are generally pretty slow and easy to read giving you an opportunity to attack after you bait his attacks and really you just need to be on the lookout for his like little purple sort of push move you can step back a little bit like you literally don't even have to dodge just step back a couple steps to avoid that and the other one is when he like throws a projectile at you which you just need to dodge doesn't even hit that hard uh if you're a distance away if you're playing a range build this is actually a fairly easy fight maybe even easier than melee because you have these huge openings when he's doing his meteors where you can get in range shots as long as you're on point with your dodges to avoid the meteors and if you're using something like carry and slicer if you can get close to him right when that ends you can do a lot of damage with carrion slicer really really quickly additionally this boss staggers very very easily so if you're using something like the ashes of war glint blade phalanx or if you have another skill like transient moonlight or something that does a lot of stagger damage you should be going for staggers on him really quickly because he can stagger really easily giving you critical attacks hey [Music] bye [Music] [Music]

is this happening to you then you're in the right place for video game training [Music] in this video i'll show you how to defeat margat the fel omen if you want to be an absolute legend and support the channel then make sure to hit that like and subscribe button my name is azov azza now let's get into the video just before we jump into the fight i'll show you the weapons and equipment that we're using we've got two keen asymmeters plus two you can also use a shield in this fight if you are interested in that i would recommend having a decent amount of stamina perhaps the turtle talisman for increased stamina regen and ideally i would have 100 physical damage negation on that shield we've got the standard warrior armor on that we start the game with we're also rocking a green turtle talisman for a stamina recovery speed and then we'll just be using the flask of crimson tears which is plus one and we've also got a flask of wondrous physic which restores some hp as well just before the boss fight fog doors you can summon an npc to help you if you want to this guy here called a sorcerer rogier i don't know if i'm pronouncing that correctly but that's what we went for so feel free to summon the sorcerer if you do want to you can also use an item called markets shackle which you can use two times in this battle which will bring margaret down to the ground and allow you to get in some free hits you can buy margaret shackle from an npc in murk water cave which is located a little bit north of this lake you'll have to fight this npc and forgive him halfway through the battle in order to unlock his shop it's also worth mentioning that after you do win that battle you will need to travel away from that location and then travel back into merckwater cave to be able to access the shop market shackle will cost you 5 000 runes there are three main attacks that we're looking to see from margate that allow us to punish one is where he holds his staff up above his head for a good few seconds and then slams it down towards the floor there's two variants of this attack depending on the distance between you and margaret the second attack that we're looking for is the one where he jumps up in the air and then kind of thrusts his staff into the floor and the third attack that we're looking for is the one where he jumps up into the air with the hammer and then smashes the hammer into the floor generally for the rest of the attacks i would advise just avoiding them completely and keeping yourself a safe distance away from margate which is generally about a medium distance to a long distance away from him now let's go into detail and break those moves down so usually he'll start with his two daggers you can just kind of like walk to the side or roll to the sides to avoid those dagger dagger so just side step for those daggers and generally we want to be about a mid-range distance away from him so not too far but also not too close just out of reach of his staff essentially is a good place to be what tends to happen with margaret is the attacks that are with his staff generally tend to be more sort of like wind up attacks and roll catch attacks and then the other hand his daggers tend to be a lot faster and um not as much wind up on those although some of his staff attacks are still quite fast like that the under swing they just did there it's really really fast one two three roll on three for the staff plunge attack you can get in like three strikes or so and then back up after that staff plunge one two three and then one two three back up so it's going to go into hammer phase so when he jumps with one two three couple of attacks and then get out of there after the hammer one two three that's the best one to punish him that specific move right there especially in phase one he will only do that staff into the ground move in phase one and he usually does that after he's thrown the daggers dagger dagger two three that's the one that's the easiest to punish him from is the staff plunge into the ground in this first phase so ideally if you want to bait him around this kind of distance one two three and then follow up dagger dagger jump one two three and then punish one two three back up so the dagger dagger jump is a really good one to punish him after he gets his staff kind of stuck in the ground dagger dagger jump one two three and then polish one two three back up uh another attack to punish is the one where he kind of like uh charges up his staff over his head for quite some time it's a four second delay on his overhead staff it's the one where he kind of holds it above his head for quite some time that one one two three four but if you have some distance between you and margaret like we just did it means you'll do like an extra hop forwards and then a swing around afterwards he's got two different variants of the overhead charge staff one variant is if you're really really close to him and the second variant is if you're further away he does a slightly different version of it one two three four usually does double on that one when he steps forward so getting in some attacks here is a really good chance just after that staff goes into the floor that wind up is about four seconds you can get a few strikes in there before he actually slams the staff down one two three four three four so you can punish quite a lot after that one that one was the version of the staff above his head and we were close there we go one two three four roll and then punish massively afterwards you can punish before that staff slam as well and afterwards that's the charge overhead that we are where we are far away so on that one he does like a step forward first then slams it down then always goes into a spin around afterwards that's ideally the one that we don't want we want the one where he's we're closer to him one two three four roll on the four punish back up if you're behind him watch out for the tail swing he'll tend to do like the turn around tail uh if you are directly behind him so just keep that in mind and the tail turn around is is quite fast so you just want to roll backwards out of the way so there's a couple of prime times to punish after the hammer one two three roll on the three you can only really get in safely one attack after the hammer and then roll straight away to get out of there give some distance so a couple of different things that you can do here usually after the daggers he does the hammer overhead which is good for us because we can get in our strikes one two three four usually four seconds on that overhead staff wind up dagger dagger usually into hammer roll forward one two back up so on this bit ideally he will throw the daggers if he throws the daggers he usually follows that up with a hammer strike so dagger dagger hammer after the hammer is your chance to get in your attack so dagger dagger hammer roll and then one two get out of there after that there you go sometimes he goes into this staff after the dagger it's not as common he's going to step forward and then spin again so that is that the safest thing you can possibly do really is just bait out that daggerdagger hammer and then just punish after the hammer hits the floor there are other times you can get an attack but if you want to be ultra safe then the dagger dagger hammer overhead is probably the safest attack to punish in this second phase it's usually not worth being really close to him because he'll do a massive amount of combos it's a lot easier to kind of like stay back but not too far back because if you're too far away it won't bait the hammer for example if he does dagger dagger we are this distance which is a good distance to get the hammer there we go so if you want to play ultra safe just keep baiting those dagger dagger hammers and you should be good to go depends how greedy you want to be uh with how much damage you want to put in if you want to be ultra ultra safe then just put in one attack a lot of the other moves i would not recommend punishing after just those ones that were mentioned before okay so medium distance i'll try and show you if we are far away dagger dagger is not going to follow up because he knows that he's not going to make it over to our character so the ai is not going to let him jump and ideally we want to let him jump so one two three and then polish one two three if you're close like that it just goes into a crazy wombo combo of uh you know daggers and staffs and swords and hammers and stuff so it's a lot safer just to uh kind of keep your distance like that and then bait one so if you're feeling spicy you can stay around and try and punish further but it's usually a good idea not to you can also use the opportunity to heal up so as soon as you get that hammer uh slammed into the ground you know it's gonna be stuck there in that animation for a good few seconds so you can just kind of back up and run away pop a flask if you want to so if your health is looking a bit low and that's also a good opportunity to kind of like back up pop your flasks and stuff and get yourself ready for the next uh bit of the battle just want to show you a couple of extra bits you can go to item crafting and craft yourself some foods for example we can make pickled turtle neck which increases our stamina recovery speed so if you've got anything that helps put up your attack power or increase your stamina recovery then feel free to craft that and pop that you can also use a full calling finger remedy so if you want to invite other players into your world to help you fight the boss then use that one you can also use spirit ashes and a good one to use in this fight is lone wolf ashes if you don't have the spirit bell and the lone wolf ashes just yet then make sure to head on over to church of ella the one that's near the start of the game and there should be an npc there called ronnie that will give you the ashes and the bell so on this one i'm just going to show you the fight with the pickled turtle neck as well as the spirit wolves so we're going to pop that food jump on in we'll summon wolves he'll usually start with throw in the daggers just head to your left or right ideally try and lure those daggers away from the wolves so they don't take too much damage at the start of the fight everything else is exactly the same just makes things a little bit easier with these wolves another reason that they're really good is because they kind of spread out so what that means is a lot of his attacks will just hit one of the wolves kind of keeps them going for a little bit longer so i recommend trying to get stuck in really as much as you can do while the wolves are still alive and try and get his hp down as much as possible here comes the hammer one two three roll through it punish um you can also knock him down if you're pumping out a lot of damage like that you'll find that it does uh knock him down uh basically you have to do a lot of damage in quite a short space of time to get the uh knock down uh there goes the wolves as you can see it kind of does help out quite a lot and his hp will be [Music] quite low by the time that the wolves have done their job and it just leaves you to finish off the rest uh yourself and once again just use the same tactics that we went over before the hammer slam punish right now after the hammer or you can use it to heal um if your health is looking really spicy you can just run very far away and heal just watch out for the daggers if you do do that because you'll try and close the gap and he'll try and uh knock you out of your healing animation with his daggers punish one two like i say usually one punish is the safest bet but you can go for two if you're feeling spicy you can also try a charge attack like that so the charge attack can also come in useful hopefully you enjoyed this video and it helped you out in

Title: How To Easily Defeat Godrick - Elden Ring

is this happening to you [Music] then you're in the right place for video game training [Music] in this video i'll show you how to defeat godric the grafted if you want to be an absolute legend and support the channel then make sure to hit that like and subscribe button my name is azov azza now let's get into the video first of all i'll just show you the equipment and the setup that we are using so we have two keen oscillators one is plus four and one is plus six we get the keen aspect from the relevant ashes of war one is quick step and one is spinning slash a keen type weapon does more damage with a high dexterity and our character has a relatively high dexterity at this point to be able to apply an ashes of war to a weapon you'll need a wet stone knife which is a key item that you'll find in the first kind of enemy camp area of the game you can also pick up a key item called an iron wet blade which kind of lets you tweak an ashes of war a little bit into a different aspect this one lets you aspect it to heavy keen or quality a quick clip to show you where this iron wet blade is located inside of storm vale castle just a quick side note with the ashes of war if you are looking to grab some you'll find an npc that sells some at this war master shack which is kind of like east of storm hill shack we're also using a kite shield which requires 12 strength to use and this has 100 physical damage negation we'll be using this for some guard counters any shield is fine but i would recommend 100 physical damage negation if you can do to actually get this kite shield we bought it from a merchant which is behind stormville castle you will have to skip around the side of stormville castle if you want to head over and buy this from that merchant if you do want to skip stormvale castle you can check out my video on that route i'll link it in the youtube pop-up cards we've got a green turtle talisman which raises stamina recovery speed i will also be using a flame drake talisman which boosts fire damage negation as you may suffer some fire damage on this fight so we opted for this one we may also use some pickled turtle neck to increase stamina recovery speed you can also summon an npc cooperator if you do want to called nephili lu you'll have to activate them first of all by talking to them you'll find them kind of straightforward from the boss door now that there's been an npc marker added to the map with the most recent elder ring update i'll show you on the map where you can find them we'll be looking for some specific moves from godric that allow us to punish so let's break them down and go into detail what you may find as well depending on the situation is that we switch between the double swords or the sword and shield depending on what he does i'm gonna try and show you the weapon drag the rolling time on that one is four seconds one two three four and then punish or heal here a lot of the time he will open up with his weapon that drags across the floor one two three four roll on the four for that particular attack and then polish just holding this weapon is kind of aggressively grunting is going to go into his wombo combo you can roll through this last one and then punish right here he's holding his weapon up he's going to go into a wombo combo want to back up away from that you can use that chance to heal or punish dependent on your situation aggressive grunting you can kind of tell with that one because he holds his weapon kind of pointed up towards the sky as such standard jump just roll straight through that you can punish after the jump he just does standard swings like that you can hold down block and then uh right trigger after blocking the attack which is a guard counter with his standard sort of attacks sometimes uh one arm kind of like follows up the other so just be aware of that if you do enough damage and guard counters like that it will knock him down to his knees and you can follow that up with a critical strike so just keep that in mind if he does the spin around he's basically going to go into a roll then jump you kind of go underneath him and then punish from behind so spin to win we're gonna go double swords for that one he's gonna jump up afterwards we're gonna roll under punish usually twice is safe he's gonna do spin to win he's gonna do a roll and then just roll underneath him and you can also use that chance to heal up if you do want to sometimes after the roll he will go into an attack if you're not too sure you can have your shield up uh ready to block his attacks especially if you've got 100 physical damage negation then you'll literally just tank all of the damage completely so there's no issues in just having a shield up if there's some distance between you and godric like this he'll usually go into kind of ranged aerial attacks like that so just keep that in mind you can kind of like dodge towards your left and right to avoid them you can also shield up if you're not too sure i'll spin to win let's try and get some distance so we can see the arranged attack so roll and then roll there is a little bit of a delay between when he kind of swings his weapon upwards and the timing of the air kind of reaching your character so don't roll straight away when he kind of swings his weapon upwards just keep that delay in mind between his weapon and your character he's been to win get some distance he should do the range roll and roll he would essentially do that for phase one and phase two that attack is exactly the same apart from one that just looks more fiery and one looks less fiery this one one two three jump one two jump and then punish one two three back up one two three jump one two jump and punish ideally not on the stairs it's a bit harsh on the stairs to be fair so one two three jump one two jump and then punish if he puts his weapon into the ground like that you can also just back up quite a lot to avoid that attack completely so if you're not too sure on the timings of the jumps you can just back up a lot uh but the downside to backing up is that you can't punish afterwards if you're close you can punish we're trying to push him into phase two so as he kind of gets knocked down like that you can do some damage just try and place yourself not at the front of him because you can take a hit when he changes from phase one to phase two phase two try and get in as much damage as you can do watch out for the attack coming down instantly at the start of phase two you want to sprint straight forward and just place yourself in front of godric you can place some damage down uh if you do place enough damage down you can do a knock down like that and follow up with a critical strike you may want to whip up the shield on this bit in phase two because there's a lot more fire and crazy stuff popping off watch out for his dragon grab in this phase you'll kind of see it winding up watch out for the grab you want to be kind of like rolling towards this side of him if you see the dragon grab try and show you some of the fire it's a little bit tricky with his fire attacks uh if he's walking forward like that you can just back up definitely have your shield up if that is the scenario ideally you don't want to be too far away from him in phase two because if you are far away from him in phase two you'll just see a lot more fire just makes things a bit spicier so we've got more fire if you can do you can try and get behind him and you can punish from behind just sometimes a bit tricky to get there if you're too far away this one is kind of walking forwards with the fire you can just back up definitely have your shield up sideways fire you want to try and roll through it in a left kind of motion fire up in the sky run forward to avoid that one you can punish or heal from behind there's an incoming fire you can technically sort of dodge through that or roll through that kind of goes in a sweeping type motion it's gone into the fire so you can always punish from behind if you spray in fire like that here comes the flames just back up for that one if you're far away or if you're close to him try and get yourself behind him try and roll through that one in kind of like a left motion like that as the fire is sweeping across if you kind of roll towards the left and just run away here use that chance to heal up or rebuff with some food and stuff sideways fire try and roll towards your left to dodge that one this is a fire attack where he just kind of puts fire towards the floor where he's standing that sideways one once again just rolls straight through it in phase two it's got slightly different timings on these uh ground pounds and phase two he does three ground pounds instead of just two one two three jump one two jump one two three four jump so that last one is a bit more delayed so just keep in mind three ground pounds in phase two just keep in mind you can also use your spirit ashes so i'll just show you the ashes on this one we're gonna be using the three wolves pop a pickled turtle's neck and jump into it essentially with this the wolves will kind of take the attention and it allows us to be a bit more aggressive if he does is kind of aoe ground pound then the wolves are not really very useful here we go as soon as i said it there we go wolves are essentially deleted so just keep that in mind with this fight if he does those aoes then um your your wolves will essentially be taken out of the fight pretty quick hopefully you enjoyed this video

that like and subscribe button my name is azov azza now let's get into the video i'll just show you on the map where this bus is located it's a little bit east of this smoldering church just here and this bus does seem quite weak to fire so if you can craft it go into your item crafting and craft some fire pots you can also craft some fire grease to apply to your weapon you can also use spirit summons forward slash spirit ashes on this fight so feel free to summon you can also choose to fight this on horseback or on foot the choice is yours alright so let's jump into the fight the first thing that i'll show you is the fire pots so you want to be not too far but not too close uh usually on horseback is quite good specifically for the fire pots uh it does quite a good chunk of damage as you can see technically speaking if you had enough of these firepots you could pretty much just finish the fight entirely by just throwing firepots this particular attack you can just roll right and left over and over again to avoid those attacks uh you can of course do fire pots from the ground uh like so it's usually a good idea to get on horseback though and kind of lure him around the edges of this tree he's doing that attack again so we gotta get rolling let's roll right and left throw those firepots might kind of lure him back he kind of goes to a certain distance and then tends to do like a little backtrack thing like he's doing right now and as you can see they do quite a massive amount of damage so if you had enough you could just win the fight by just doing this if you wanted to just kind of lure him back around again when it's safe uh just throw the fire pot that one i'd recommend getting off the horse technically speaking you could avoid this attack as well by going quite far around the tree and just letting the tree kind of block all of the attacks so that's the fire parts that's that bit um and with that ranged attack that is doing there it's usually a good idea to have some distance between you and him because if you are close and he's doing that ranged attack um you might also do melee and it's really difficult to dodge like the melee attacks and the range all at the same time it's absolute chaos so that's why it's good to get some distance we're going to apply the fire here it comes again this time he's probably going to try melee now he's just spamming the same attack over and over again so what i'll do now is show you some close-up stuff yeah usually i lock off when we get close up and stay roughly around this area just here this one is going to jump up and just be careful of like the scarlet rot that kind of happens in front of him there so when he jumps on the floor there's like a conal attack where scarlet rock kind of uh sort of shoots out in a cone that's where it's quite tricky like that so if you're doing melee at the same time it's a bit of a pain it seems to like this attack today quite a lot i am trying to show you some other attacks but uh let's get close up so you can do the ground pound again so just stay on this side attack when you can do when it's when it's nice and safe this is the one here so just roll kind of like towards his side just be aware of you know don't stay in the sort of like cone that happens in front of where he lands and eventually the scarlet rot will kind of go away after a few seconds so you can kind of just uh keep on baiting that around just be careful because it does do damage um if it does hit you as well make sure to heal up when you can do but basically yeah just keep doing this and uh keep going around in this kind of motion attack what you can do roll at the last second heel up if you need to as well you get like a second or so uh after he's done the attack he kind of lands on the ground get a second here to do whatever you want to attack or or heal up he also does a foot stump [Music] just keep on kiting him around like that and essentially that is the fight there we go and you get the green burst crystals tier for winning that fight as well as the flame shrouded cracked tier there are a few more of those avatars knocking about here and there the fight itself however is quite similar or sameish to the one that we just did if i do find an avatar that is massively different to the one that we just fought then i will make a separate video for

is this happening to you [Music] then you're in the right place for video game training [Music] in this video i'll show you how to defeat rinala queen of the full moon if you want to be an absolute legend and support the channel then make sure to hit that like and subscribe button my name is azov azza now let's get into the video i'll just show you the setup that we're working with we have a keen symmetra plus seven keen symmetra plus six a kite shield plus four which has 100 physical damage negation we've got a green turtle talisman for increased stamina recovery speed we've got crimson amber medallion which raises maximum hp in the flask of wondrous physic we've got a crystal that increases our stamina recovery speed and a crystal that raises our maximum stamina and we might pop some pickled turtle neck for extra stamina recovery speed i'll also show you a ranged strategy in phase one which might help with some of the singing students in this fight you can use spirit ashes forward slash spirit summons however i would recommend saving them until phase two let's get into the fight okay so phase one is all about attacking these students that are singing they have that golden glow around them and they'll also be shooting these books at you with these what you can do is if you can't actually see them on your screen they'll be singing that weird little song and the further away that you get from them the quieter the song will be and then the closer that you get to them the louder the song will be so keep that in mind if you can't see them and you need to locate them so that is that and essentially we have to attack them three times uh three separate students uh to break the golden sphere that is protecting rinala it's kind of like floating up in the sky there um so technically you don't actually have to kill this enemy right here you just have to attack them for example if we just attack one time it takes away the singing and the golden glow and it puts it onto the next one so this is the second one i'll just show you a quick strategy oh yeah just watch out for all the stuff that's kind of like falling uh from above and stuff like as you're running around i was going to show you the ranged strategy i don't really tend to use this one too much myself but it may come in handy uh you can also try and look for an opening and just shoot the one that's singing now we'll move on to the third one so after we attack this third one she will then fall from the sky and that will be our chance to do some good damage so let's go for it [Music] that's the third one you can run over try to have full stamina hold down right trigger for a charge let that go as the golden barrier breaks then just go to town usually until about halfway and just watch out for that attack there try and get away now this is the second phase it will start to get a bit crazier in this bit in this phase so if you can do try and be fast at locating the students so you can avoid all the crazy stuff that's coming out here that's three of them heel up hold down right trigger you can finish her off here now what you can do is if you can leave a little bit of health you can pop a pickled turtle neck then finish it then flask watch out for the fire so now we've got the flask and the pickled turtle neck both applied all right so at the start of phase two run straight forward and then get attacking you'll avoid her attack and you can also punish a lot of time in this phase i recommend staying relatively close to her um a lot of the attacks you're kind of just running and rolling to the sides to avoid most of them if you're going to use a spirit summons forward slash spirit ashes this is the phase to whip them out in phase two and that is a homing attack there for the staff spin to win uh like i say with this phase it's just a lot of running and rolling to the sides to avoid uh she will eventually do spirit summons in a second but when you push her health down a little bit further it's usually about halfway so we'll push her on to the spirit summons phase this is the full moon attack so uh with this one i'll probably back up a little bit you don't want to be underneath it it will do a massive explosion uh like that this attack here you can just back up a second and heal up or apply some more buffs what we'll do is we'll buff up and then we'll push it onto the next phase i'll try and show you the spirit summons watch out for that sort of like uh almost like a shotgun blast attack that she does because it can one shot you um if all of the uh blasts does get ya so watch out for that okay so let's buff up i'll try and push it just staying close that's the summon animation this one is the dragon so the dragon will breathe fire across and then it'll go into a bunch of other attacks um i'd recommend ignoring the summons and just focusing on rinala the summons will disappear uh usually after about five or six seconds or so i'm gonna rebuff so that was the dragon one uh just keep in mind that she's obviously doing the other attacks at the same time which is obviously quite spicy the wolves just attack get rid of them stay quite close once again remember to keep topping up your health another summon this one is giant so giant will kind of like jump out of the sky and do a ground pound attack then a couple more a couple more attacks then it will disappear another summon this one will probably be bloodhound night this one just keep on rolling and running away or you can whip out a shield if you've got a good shield to block that guy uh but by the time that we've made our way back over to rinaldi you see that the summons already gone so it's usually not worth actually focusing on the spirit ash okay so that's all the stuff that she's got to offer really so other than that to keep on top of your health got the wolves again and like i say just focus on ranala and you'll be good to go there we go and that is the fight hopefully you enjoyed this video and it helped you out in some way if it did remember to like subscribe and drop a comment you can check out all the other content that i make at azovar.com the

Title: How To Defeat Crucible Knight + Misbegotten Warrior - Elden Ring

is this happening to you then you're in the right place for video game training [Music] in this video i'm going to show you how to defeat the misbegotten warrior and the crucible knight at red main castle if you want to be an absolute legend and support the channel then make sure to hit that like and subscribe button my name is azov azza now let's get into the video i'll just show you the gear that we are working with for this fight we have two key in symmeters plus eight we've got a kite shield plus six we've got a green turtle talisman for increased stamina recovery speed crimson amber medallion for increased maximum hp we've got a winged sword insignia which increases our attack power if we keep on attacking the attacks have to be consecutive and if there's a short period of time where you're not attacking then you'll lose this attack increase buff i believe that the buff applies after you attack the enemy three times and if you keep on attacking back to back then it keeps on raising your attack power i think it's got a total of four different tiers of attack increase i'll just show you on the map where you can pick up this winged sword insignia is it this cave here called stillwater cave which is just past stormville castle you will need to make your way through that cave and then kill a boss at the end to then get that talisman and i would highly recommend getting this talisman specifically for this fight we'll be using the flask for increased stamina recovery speed as well as extra stamina exalted flesh to increase our physical attack we'll be throwing some poison pots some fire pots and we'll be using some poison grease and some fire grease we're going to show you two slightly different ways to approach this fight one is using the poison grease and the other one is using the fire grease this fight is quite specific so we will be using pretty much everything mentioned in this setup it is worth mentioning that i do have godric's great rune activated for this fight which raises all attributes i do have a video on how to defeat godric if you're interested in that i also have another video on how to activate godric's great rune you will need to use a rune arc to actually activate the great rune and get its effects but don't go crazy using the rudox because you will need some of those for later bosses we've also got an ash of war applied to our weapon called war cry which gives us a bit of an attack boost we'll also be using the lone wolf ashes plus one i'll just show you on the map where this boss is located it's south east caled down here red main castle just next to this site of grace it is worth mentioning that if you have started a particular quest at red main castle where there's a bunch of npcs at a festival then this boss fight might not actually be here but if you do complete that quest line then the castle might revert back and this boss fight might reappear i'm not 100 sure if this boss fight does reappear after you complete that questline if you do know feel free to let me know in the comments other than that let's jump into the fight okay so like i mentioned before i'm going to show you two slightly different variations on how to deal with the first bit one is going to use poison grease and one is going to use fire grease the first one is going to use fire grease and the idea with this one is that we burn down the misbegotten warrior so fast that we've actually deleted him before the crucible knight gets to us in battle okay so first of all let's try the hyper aggressive strategy we'll use the flask and then the exalted flesh then war cry we'll jump in summon the wolves first of all apply some fire grease to your weapon and lock on switch to the poison pots we're going to use the wolves as a bit of a barrier between us and the miss magotta warrior we've landed two poison parts and then we just want to pile on the pressure really hard here just keep on slicing and dicing away be very careful of your own health as well to keep the pressure on the crucible knight is on his way don't panic it's fine that takes care of the misbegotten warrior just as the crucible knight kind of pulls up to the fight and then if you need to heal up at this point just back up get a lot of distance between you and the crucible knight and start popping your flasks and stuff so that is one way of dealing with the first bit next i'll show you the slight variant that uses poison grease and a kite shield for some guard counters and in this version the crucible knight is going to be making his way over to us and joining the fight alongside the miss begotten warrior so let's give that a go we'll use the flask first of all and then the exalted flesh and then we'll use warcry jump on in summon the wolves then apply the poison grease switch to poison pots lock on throw two poison parts try to connect at least two of these ideally if not it's okay because we've got poison applied to our weapon on this version anyway so just make sure that you can see that kind of weird green uh poison aura coming out of the misforgotten warrior i'm going to leave his health there on purpose and show you this strategy in case the crucible knight does join the fight like so that's fine if he does if you look at the miss begotten warrior's health you'll notice that it's ticking down it's constantly ticking down because we've poisoned him this time applied that poison to him so what we can do is whip out the kite shield here so you'll notice that we blocked that attack there from the misbegotten warrior and we follow that up with the guard counter so with this one just keep on backing up whip out the shield when needed and you'll notice that his health is still just ticking away ticking down ticking down which is absolutely perfect if he does that jump you can guard counter it just keep on backing up you got to be careful of your own health as well of course you can also use fire pots here so if you've got enough distance i'm not sure i'm gonna be able to show you but let's give it a go if you got enough distance you can throw these fire pots like so to take him out so a combination of the poison and the fire parts as well as the guard counters is a good way to uh deal with the misbegotten warrior as well so feel free to use that strategy if it works for you so lastly that just leaves us with the crucible knight so with this guy a couple of bits and bobs to keep in mind if you want to heal up just run far away so you've got a nice bit of distance and then heal up we'll be using the double swords for this guy and just attack in once most of the time so one attack there dodge dodge one dodge and then one attack if we need to reapply some buffs and stuff you can run quite far away once again go the entire arena either buff should have enough time before he gets over here so dodge dodge one attack dodge one attack this one is going to do like a spin so just back up a little bit you can actually attack three times there if you just put yourself out of reach of the spin to win attack that he does so dodge one attack there's a slight delay on that upward swing you can also use the kite shield i wouldn't recommend guard counters however on this guy although you can tank some attacks like that you'll notice that it's tanking all of the damage there so if you get yourself in a spicy situation feel free to whip out the shield so just basically being very very patient with this and just looking for the chance to strike so one attack there it's gonna phase change you can attack once or twice there with this bit you can actually roll through it if you need to reapply some stuff you can use that chance now to reapply your buffs or your food buffs and things like that we're just looking for those chance to strike this one's going to do the double spin it's back up a little bit then one two three that's the best time to strike after he kind of grips the sword with two hands and does like the spin to win thing so you want to kind of try and bait that that spin to win this one once again you can roll through you could use this time to heal or apply buffs like so uh sometimes you can actually get a pot on him like so so if you throw it any kind of attacks then um he'll kind of like move his shield out the way to do his attack and the pot will connect but if you throw it when the shield is up and the shield pretty much just tanks the entirety of the firepot so sometimes it's not as beneficial to use the firepots on this guy and you can also get hit like that if you're not careful so i'm going to use this chance to heal i'm going to roll the opposite way and get some distance and heal so that is that a lot of this phase is quite similar apart from that tail whip is insanely fast so be very very careful of that you can also polish this if you roll towards him he's going to tail whip that's the double tail whip because it's a slight delay you can attack twice after the double um so you can attack once after the single tail whip and you can attack twice after the double tail whip try to watch out for those that's the single so we can push once this one we can roll towards him he's usually gonna tell whip he's gone for the double we can punish twice one two that's the single we could punish once but we were too far away so we couldn't um so that's kind of most things that it really does uh to be fair so a lot of the time with this guy it's just about being like really really patient so this one we're going to roll towards he's going to tell it once he's gone for the double which is really harsh to dodge if you get hit the first time so what he tends to do in my experience is he tends to do the double uh usually when his health is lower and the single we could punish once there the single one is health is a bit higher that's the single we can punish this one once again you can roll through if you go the opposite direction that's your chance to use your heels and your buffs and stuff uh but yeah other than that that's uh that's the fight so let's look for those chances to strike you also run away like i said mentioned before you can just run back get some distance and pop a heel if need be that's the single we can attack once we can potentially punish this if we can get there he's gone for the double this time and we could even finish in with a fire pot if we can get that part to connect well there we go so we moved his shield just out of the way which allowed the fire pot to connect there so other than that that is the fight hopefully you enjoyed this video and it helped you out in some way if it did remember to like subscribe and drop a comment you can check out all the other content that i make at

is this happening to you then you're in the right place for video game training [Music] in this video i'll show you how to defeat the magma worm on your way up the cliff side to the altus plateau if you want to be an absolute legend and support the channel then make sure to hit that like and subscribe button my name is azov azza now let's get into the video i'll just show you on the map where this boss is located so it's on your way up the cliff side this is the site of grace just outside the boss fight there are a couple of npc summon signs just outside of the boss fog gate you've got this guy here there's also another one just here i'll show you the setup that we're working with for this fight we've got two keen symmeters plus eight a kite shield that we might use we're also using a flame drake talisman which boosts fire damage negation on top of that we've also got fireproof dried liver which also boosts fire damage negation frost forward slash freeze is quite good against this enemy so we have some freezing grease to apply to our weapon and we've also got some freezing pots that we can throw okay so let's jump in to the fight we can apply our buffs just after we pass the fog wall so we'll pop the flask food buff now we can use the fireproof dried liver freezing grease and also whip out the wolves although they'll probably get deleted by the lava but here we go so it usually opens the fight with this kind of like crawl forward lava spew crazy attack um the hitbox on this thing is insane so just steer clear of him and just let him do whatever it is he wants to do um he might crawl a few times he's gone third three so far just going to reapply some freezing grease but yeah after he kind of calms down a little bit we want to be heading towards his back legs so usually this is kind of the safest place to be is the [Music] uh sort of like back right and back left legs this is the sideways spew so just head on to the opposite side a few attacks in there watch out for that attack there's quite a delay on that it's a bit spicy to try and dodge that you can also use the kite shield to block it so just keeping by these legs he's doing the sideways spew head on to the opposite side a few strikes there he's doing the ground pound um i think he's got slight variations of that sword ground pound where there's one that's more delayed and one that's not so this is the sideways spew just head on to the opposite side there's the ground pound a lot of the time by staying by these legs it tends to delete a lot of the move set that he does and kind of just restricts him to certain attacks like these attacks you see in here sideways spew the ground pound just head for that one i'm kind of just like heading a bit further behind him to try and get away from the aoe that happens when he smashes the sword into the floor that's the sideways view you can also use that time to rebuff get a quick second before the spin to win that kind of comes around so a lot of the time we're just kind of staying by those back legs that was the kite shield there and because we're in front of him you'll now see that his attacks have changed slightly um he also stands on two legs when his health gets to roughly about halfway um so for this phase it's quite similar although it gets a bit spicier we're going to be applying similar-ish tactics for this phase that was a bit spicy there but basically we want to be underneath him and once again just near his legs essentially um so just kind of like i'm not locking on i'm just looking out for certain animations that he might be doing where it looks like he's gonna do one of his sword ground pounds that one there you can just stay behind him and attack the tail we need to get underneath him again because that's where it's quite safe so what we'll do is um back up a little bit until the lava has kind of disappeared underneath his legs and then just run watch out for that one because the sword kind of swings around so just run away and try and roll through the swing if possible so once again just trying to stay kind of underneath these legs here and underneath the tail just trying to keep my eye on the animations that he's doing not locking on so when i can kind of see him you know getting ready to smash down his sword into the floor i'll try and roll a couple of times once again the lava is kind of like taking away our safe spot at this point so i'm just going to back up reapply some freezing grease and also throw these freezing pots if you do have any although it's probably not the best time to throw them in phase two probably better in phase one uh really for throwing stuff but uh yeah other than that just kind of staying in this safe zone just attacking every now and again when we can do watch out for that attack there that one's got a bit of a spicy delay on it so if you need to heal just back up really good time to heal and reapply a bust is when he's doing that walking forward lava spew that you just saw there need to get back to a safe to our uh sort of like safe area underneath him so we're just gonna wait for that lava to disappear and then head back watch out for the kind of like spin around on that sword there because it comes around quite fast um but yeah other than that we're just gonna kind of get ourselves back into this position just here ended up doing three rolls there for that um sword slam because like i say sometimes um it's delayed and sometimes it's not um we also just attacked the tail there when he was doing that kind of like walk forward uh lava spew we just attacked the tail a few times to finish him off and other than that that is the fight hopefully you enjoyed this video and it helped you out in some way if it did

Title: Easily Defeat Tibia Mariner - Elden Ring
Video ID: A_PEQVbIINo
Transcript Text:
is this happening to you then you're in the right place for video game training [Music] in this video i'm going to show you how to defeat the tibia mariner near the earth tree gazing site of grace if you want to be an absolute legend and support the channel then make sure to hit that like and subscribe button my name is azov azza now let's get into the video so i'll just show you where this is on the map you want to be heading to these ruins the boss is just here and to actually access this boss you want to be going from the ur tree gazing sight of grace and then going kind of like north east a little bit up this slope and then across you'll see the boss just here just to kind of show you that the sight of grace is over there and then you want to be heading up this slope and when you get to the top the boss will be just towards your left the main piece of equipment that we'll be using for this fight are these holy water pots we'll be throwing these at the ads to delete them nice and quick we'll also be popping some fire grease onto our weapons to do some extra damage if you do have some holy grease then definitely use that this boss is quite weak to holy and we'll be using dual swords we've got the two keen scimitars we also do have one fp flask set because if we use wolf summons then we might need to restore some fp to actually throw the holy water pots because it does consume a little bit of fp when you throw one of these okay so let's jump into the actual fight itself first of all we'll pop the fire grease and then when we jump over here the fight will actually start uh so normally what he does is blow his horn and this giant skeleton will appear from underground the first attack it does is like that crazy magic beam laser beam type thing uh so you can just run straight past him to completely avoid that attack and then the marinette will kind of like teleport over this direction watch out phil every time he blows that giant horn then the the giant skeleton will basically be summoned uh from underground watch out for his attacks so for the ads basically how they work is if you attack them normally like that they'll have a chance to get back up so if you see that weird aura like that uh they'll be getting back up so you have to attack them again to make sure that they are actually dead and don't get back up so what we can do with that this is where the holy water parts come in so if you throw these one second because we've got the ad so if you throw these okay giant skeleton is in the way we'll just wait for him to uh get out of the way so if you throw these like that it will take out the ads and they won't have that second chance to get back up again and what you can do sometimes is if there's a bunch of ads that are all close together then the holy water will actually get all of them uh which is really really useful so it's worth taking those bad boys out because they do get in the way the holy water parts don't really do a lot of damage to the actual mariner himself as you can see it's just like a little bit uh you can also use holy grease put holy grease on your weapon if you do have any uh holy grease it's also really effective as well but we don't have any on this character at the minute and then you can pop some fire grease on to do a little bit of extra damage but the mariner himself is actually quite squishy so you can pretty much just uh you know start to go crazy with your attacks really once uh once the coast is clear it's kind of like the ads and stuff that make this fight uh a bit spicier and he'll teleport away again i think he goes up the cliff at this point so if you look at the top of there when his health gets a little bit lower like that it'll kind of like make you run up the side of the cliff here and obviously you'll have to avoid like the skeletons and uh the the giant skeleton and stuff like as you are on the way up once again watch out for the big skeleton uh you can of course use summons and stuff if you want to whip out uh spirit summons so what i would do with that is because we've used fp like i mentioned before it costs a little bit of fp to actually throw these um holy parts so if you if you find yourself in a situation where you want to summon uh but you're actually out of fp that's why we brought like a one of the blue flasks just in case and now you can uh summon spirit ashes whatever you want to summon there we go uh but yeah over than that that is the fight hopefully you enjoyed this video and it helped you out in some way if it did remember to like subscribe and drop a comment you can check out all the other content that i make at azovar.com

Video ID: QcSxZVdVvN0
Transcript Text:
is this happening to you then you're in the right place for video game training [Music] in this video i'm going to show you how to defeat the double crucible knights the one with the sword and shield and the one with the lance located at the oriza hero's grave you also get an insanely good armor set for defeating this boss which is the crucible knight armor set as well as the crucible knight greatsword known as odovis's greatsword if you want to be an absolute legend and support the channel then make sure to hit that like and subscribe button my name is azov azza now let's get into the video i'll just show you where this is located on the map so the hero's grave itself is just here to actually get to this hero's grave you'll need to go from this outer wall battleground site of grace work your way along this path you'll find a spirit spring just down here so fall down there then you'll go underneath this bridge follow this path around and you'll find the hero's grave just here just ahead of us is the bridge that you would go underneath just follow this around and then you'll see the entrance over here you will need to make your way through the hero's grave itself and then when you get to the end you'll find the boss fight i'll just show you the setup that we're working with for this fight we've got two keen symmeters plus 17 we've got a kite shield plus 14 although we won't really be using the kite shield we've got a green turtle talisman for increased stamina recovery speed we've got a winged sword insignia which increases our attack power as long as we keep attacking we've got a kindred of rots talisman which increases our attack if there's poison or scarlet rot active in the area i'll just show you on the map where you can get that kindred of rocks talisman you'll have to complete this cave here seath water cave we'll also be throwing some poison pots and some poison bone darts we'll be consuming some exalted flesh and depending on the situation we might apply some poison grease or some fire grease okay so let's get into the actual fight what we're going to be doing here is focusing on the crucible knight first and taking him out that's the one with the lance type weapon and then we're going to be switching our focus to crucible knight or dovis that's the one with the sword and shield to make this work we have to be quite aggressive and quite fast so let's give it a go first of all we'll pop the flask and then exalted flesh and then fire grease then we'll get the poison pots ready enter the arena use summons straight away lock on throw one poison pot and move towards our right a little bit get ready to dodge this bad boy and we want this guy's attention to be on us and kind of like bring him away from the spirit ashes a little bit need to land three poison parts to make sure poison is applied and then we need to be hyper aggressive on this lance guy um so just go crazy try and be as aggressive as humanly possible i was gonna back up and heal a little bit but basically we want to be doing as much damage to this guy before our spirit ashes die um which is right now that one two three uh roll on the three to avoid that one so yeah our ashes have died um but that's okay so what we'll do is if you look at his health it roll on the three for that you can punish after that as well uh if you look at his health the poison is kind of like ticking away is hp so what we'll do is kind of like lure them around the arena a little bit you can heal if you've got some good distance and you could also throw some more poison pots or some poison darts at this guy because he doesn't have a shield so it makes it a bit easier to like throw stuff at him whereas the other one just blocks pretty much everything that you throw so just try and get your um additional items thrown at him like poison parts or poison darts or if you've got any lightning pots or fire pots or anything like that just trying to throw them as the poison is kind of like taking down his health um you kind of got to keep an eye out for the sword and shield guy in the corner of your eye as you're running around uh the poison has worn off but that's okay so what we'll do next it's only really going to take like a couple of hits um to actually take him out but yeah just keep an eye out for the uh sword and shield guy in the corner of your eye otherwise uh you will get kind of punished uh by that guy i'll try and show you the poison darts if possible at this point it's probably just worth um attacking him if you look at his health it's just gonna take one hit to take him out but let's go for it there we go so that's um that's that one and then what i would recommend is if you need to like rebuff or heal or anything at this point i would run like the entire length of the arena then pop an item so we'll pop a flask or try and put some poison grease on might be able to reapply poison to him so for this particular enemy it's all about patience really and looking out for opportunities to strike and when you do strike you're probably going to be able to attack like one time sometimes you can attack more like two times three times but most of the time it's usually just one strike like now is like one strike roll through uh so let's focus on this guy this particular attack you want to be kind of like behind him or like run or roll behind him if possible that roll through the shield bash one strike roll through one strike i hit the shield there but there you go try and once again try and get behind him usually one strike sometimes two strikes with that one uh depending on where you land and stuff one strike one strike phase change you can punish there if you're close but we weren't i'm gonna roll in the opposite direction for that and you can use that chance to rebuff pop your bits and bobs on probably go for fire grease because you can reapply poison to him but he's quite resistant to poison to be fair um so you might want to go for fire for the additional damage you can try for the poison now but you'll notice like when you throw stuff at this guy that doesn't really uh do much because he's just got a giant shield he's got like mechanics where he punishes item usage as well so if he's like a mid-range distance between you and him if you use a flask or an item he's kind of got like a gap closer so that's why we get like insane levels of distance but in his uh second phase like this it's quite similar apart from he uses a few extra attacks so we'll try and reapply food buff if possible might even have chance for fire grease if we're lucky but there we go so one attack that's the tail the tail whip is insanely fast this time we're gonna roll through him probably to tear up that's the double tail whip because it's got a slightly longer animation you can punish twice after the double tail whip this one i'm going to try and get behind him once again it's a little bit spicy on that one because it's got a crazy like area of effect on it um but yeah just be careful of the double tail whip animation might see it again here roll through him i'm gonna go for double one and two you can punish here i'm not gonna do it because it's just gonna kill him and i just want to show you some more bits and bobs first roll through punish once that's a single tail whip so you can punish after the single tail whip and you can punish twice after the double now once again you can roll in the opposite direction if you need to rebuff we apply some fire grease and just be like really really patient looking out for those chances to strike right there i will roll towards him see what he does probably double one and two you can punish twice after that one other than that that is the fight hopefully you enjoyed

Title: How To Defeat 2x Tree Sentinels (Duo Fight) - Elden Ring
Video ID: ni7nn9ZrUig
Transcript Text:
is this happening to you then you're in the right place for video game training [Music] in this video i'm going to show you how to defeat the two tree sentinels close to the outer wall phantom tree site of grace if you want to be an absolute legend and support the channel then make sure to hit that like and subscribe button my name is azov azza now let's get into the video i'll just show you on the map where this boss is located just here the best way to approach this boss actually is to run past them first of all and then grab the site of grace behind them which is this outer wall phantom tree this will then allow us to approach the boss from behind if you're approaching these from the front then usually you'll be going from this altus highway junction and you'll be heading up this pathway here and you'll approach the bosses just in front of the gate at this point i'll just show you the setup that we're working with for this fight so we have two keen scimitars we have a kite shield we'll be using the green turtle talisman for increased stamina recovery we've got the ritual sword talisman which raises our attack power if our hp is full and we might use the great shield talisman which boosts our guardian ability basically what that does is when we block an attack it takes less stamina from our stamina bar if we have this talisman equipped and then we'll be using an assortment of quick items we've got some pickled turtle neck we've got exalted flesh we'll be throwing some poison darts some poison pots some lightning pots we might apply some lightning grease some rot grease and some poison grease these three sentinels are quite weak to lightening so if you've got any lightning attacks or lightning items then feel free to use those and we'll also be whipping out the lone wolf ashes plus two okay so let's jump into the actual fight we're gonna approach them from the back then head towards the right crouch down to about this point wait for this guy to walk off and then we can basically just completely ignore him and focus on this one next we'll whip out the wolves then buff up with some food buff up with some poison grease and ideally we want to apply poison to this guy first of all so we'll throw the pots might block the second one he's taking it that's fine if he does block the second part you can just run up and attack him a few times as he raises his weapon up into the sky you get a few uh free strikes in there you can also use poison darts we've just applied the rock grease to our weapon what we're gonna do next is keep on attacking him until he gets the scarlet rut which is right now uh next the wolves will probably get wrecked roughly around this point which is fine if they do and what we're gonna do is get onto torrent and we're actually gonna jump up here and just wait a second so if you keep an eye on his health uh there's actually two ticks so he's got poison and scarlet rot both applied to him even though the aura of scarlet rot seems to kind of like take over the aura of the poison but you should see two ticks on the health bar uh what you can do is try and throw some more poison darts if you want to make sure that poison is still applied uh a lot of the time this guy will basically get stuck behind the barriers and then you can just wait for scarlet rot and poison to do their job and that's pretty much it you can also throw some at lightning pots they do insane levels of damage against this guy um but yeah if you just keep your eyes peeled on his health bar that's pretty much it that will delete him you can also you know get some attacks in here and there but just be careful um you know of yourself getting hit through the barrier as well because obviously his weapon can reach quite far uh through there so the second one is kind of just waiting here like patiently for us which is very kind of him so on this bit it's basically gonna be quite a similar thing i tend to try and apply poison first before scarlet rot but you can do it the other way around it's just that the scarlet rot red aura kind of takes over the green aura so sometimes it's difficult to tell um if you've applied poison to him if he's already got the scarlet rot on first so that's why i usually go for the poison verse but it's up to you so we are gonna pop poison onto our weapon exalted flesh and we'll try and get poison first of all so i think it's about six hits it takes usually raises his weapon up into the air i think one more hit should get poisoned on in theory yeah so that's poison on uh technically speaking you could just do the same thing and just leave poison on or you could try and get scarlet rot as well if you want to do um but you could just make it work with just the poison we'll try for scarlet rot see if we can get it on just be careful of your health don't be afraid to back up a second pop a flask so eventually we should see the scarlet rot there we go we've got it on so once again same kind of technique jump on up get off tarim just back up a little bit just be careful uh like i say his weapons can go through the actual barrier so just be careful of that uh once again we can whip out poison darts if you've got any make sure that poison is still applied to him you've got your lightning pots they do massive massive damage you can also use lightning grease he is quite weak to lighten so if you wanted to pop some lightning grease on your weapon and stuff that would also work but other than that to keep a decent distance behind the barrier to make sure that you're not getting destroyed and that is the fight hopefully you enjoyed this video and it helped you out in some way if it did remember to like subscribe and drop a comment you can check out all the other

Title: Defeat Radahn Solo (No Summons) - Elden Ring
Video ID: NihPFEMY9Hs
Transcript Text:
is this happening to you then you're in the right place for video game training [Music] in this video i'll show you how to defeat radon solo without using any summons at all and you can even completely skip phase two if you want to if you want to be an absolute legend and support the channel then make sure to hit that like and subscribe button my name is azovo aza now let's get into the video there's quite a few tactics and strategies that i'll show you in this video so you can choose to use all of these if you want to or you can just cherry pick the ones that work for you we'll mostly be using scarlet rot and poison to get this strategy to work but i'll show you a bunch of different strategies and tactics then you can choose the ones that work for you so there is a little bit of preparation required on that basis i'll add youtube chapters to this video i'll just show you where this fight is located on the map you'll have to head to red main castle and the closest site of grace is this chamber outside the plaza you'll have to head inside and then talk to an npc to start the radar fight i'll just show you the setup that we're working with for this fight and it's quite specific so here we go we've got two keen symmeters plus 17 although we won't really be fighting radon up close and personal so don't worry too much about these melee weapons we'll be using the finger sacred seal which you can buy from the merchant two-finger maiden at the round table and this sacred seal requires four strength and ten faith to use and along with that sacred seal we'll be using an incantation which is called rotten breath this requires 15 faith and 12 arcane to use and you get this rotten breath incantation from the cathedral of dragon communion located at south caled and to buy rotten breath you'll have to approach this thing here and press ritual of dragon communion and it will also cost one dragon heart you can get a dragon heart by killing a dragon we'll also be using a serpent bow plus six and we'll be using serpent arrows along with the serpent bow you get the serpent bow in a cave called abandoned cave i do have a video on how to complete that cave i'll link that in the pop-up cards to use the serpent bow you'll need eight strength 15 dexterity and 11 arcane so the serpent bow the finger seal and the rotten breath all work together quite well because the stats that are required for all three of them are quite similar and the serpent arrows cannot be crafted you have to purchase them specifically from a merchant that merchant is located here if you don't have the serpent bow and the serpent arrows that's absolutely fine you can choose to use a different bow and you could choose to trade out the serpent arrows for poison arrows instead although the poison arrows don't have as much of the poison buildup as the serpent arrows do we do also have some rot arrows equipped which cause a scarlet rock buildup we might even use this beast crest shield although it's not very often that we would use this i just wanted to show you the shield that we are rocking we are using an ash of war on this shield called barricade shield and what that does is temporarily boost our block you can get the barricade shield ash of war by defeating a boss called knight's cavalry it's the one that spawns quite close to this castle mourn rampart site of grace the boss will be on this path and it only spawns at night time we'll only really use the shield to block one specific attack so any good shield should be fine in terms of talismans i've got arsenal charm plus one which greatly raises our maximum equipment load the reason that i'm using that is because we are wielding quite a lot of different equipment we've got the crucible armor set on we've got two swords a shield a bow and a sacred seal so by using this it means we can equip quite a lot of different stuff and we can also have really decent armor on at the same time in case you wanted to get your hands on and use the arsenal charm plus one i'll just show you on the map where it's located it's inside this altus tunnel we've got the arrows reach talisman which increases our bose range you'll find that arrows reach talisman here on the map it's kind of like on a little bridge thing in a chest you have to go up the slope from the gate front sight of grace and then backtrack on yourself a little bit to find this bridge and we also have the lance talisman which increases our attacks whilst on horseback and we will mostly be on horseback for this fight this also applies to the arrows that we shoot and we'll be shooting arrows from horseback you'll find the lance talisman here it's on a body if you wanted to you could also use the arrows sting talisman which raises the attack power of arrows and bolts and you'll find that arrows sting tasman up a tower is very close to the impassable great bridge sight of grace you're still with me i know this is quite a lot of preparation work but believe me it's worth it i've also kind of split the flasks down the middle so we've got seven of the helium flasks we've got six of the fp flasks that's because we'll be using the dragon's rotten breath and that costs fp to use so that's why we bring these fp flasks along we might pop some pickled turtle neck for increased stamina recovery speed we're bringing along some poison pots because we might throw some poison pots and we've also got a bunch of poison bone darts that we can throw as well what i did was actually respect my build a little bit to allow me to use all this equipment and incantations you can reassign your character's stats using ronald's rebirth you will of course have to defeat ronaldo first to unlock this option in the game i do have a boss fight guide for ronaldo if you're interested i'll link that in the pop-up cards now you then have to select the rebirth option and it will cost you one larval tier to do a rebirth this is where rinala is located on the map at the raya lucaria academy this is a larval tier which you'll need to do a rebirth and then respect your build what i would recommend is probably having at least two larval tiers so if you're gonna respect your build specifically just to fight radon and then you're not happy with it after that you'll need another larval tier to then respect your build back into whatever it was before so just keep that in mind if you're thinking about respecting your build a little bit to allow you to use the rotten breath incantation okay so with all that being said let's jump into the fight first of all run straight forward towards these weapons in the sand the weapons in the sand will tank one of the hits and then they'll be destroyed keep on running forward we roll through the second one kind of head towards the right a little bit here when he does the attack like that we range down arrows from the sky you want to be mounting up on torrent still heading towards the right a little bit like this kind of angling our camera so we can see what he's up to at this point the dune will kind of like tank the hits of the arrows that he shoots towards us now you still got to be careful of the raining down arrows that follow you around so just watch out for those um and then we'll use the dragon rock breath so what we'll do is send him into melee mode by getting quite close and we need to use this rotten breath after he's done a combo it's usually the safest place to do it so he's gonna go into a combo now one two one two and then breath roughly around there hold down rb and then back up it's gonna go back into another combo just keep on backing up it's usually best to apply the rotten breath after that combo uh that we did before not the other ones so not so much that attack just kind of stay in a medium distance one two one two head towards and rotten breath roughly around there use the blue flask he's going to buff his weapons now you can get a little bit of rotten breath in there but you've got to be careful so at this point the scarlet rot is ticking down his health quite fast watch out for these gravity orbs just kind of dodge towards the left or right uh while it's locked on to avoid those it's usually about three seconds on the timing of your dodge with torrent uh so torrent has a few invincibility frames so one two three roughly around there so we want to be pulling him towards the castle at this point uh and getting quite close to the water because he's about to transition into phase two very very soon you could jump over that uh shock wave attack there so there he goes is jumped up into the sky so what we need to do is be at the edge at the very edge of the water hold up your shield and there we go that's redone just a bit of info with the waters edge basically you want to be as close as humanly possible to this edge as you can be without actually falling off you could ideally do with popping up your shield and if you have it you could also use barricade shield for a little bit of extra defense obviously try and make sure your health is topped up because you will be tanking that hit and it will do a fair amount of damage to keep that in mind okay so next i'll show you the serpent bell or the bow and arrow approach whatever bow you might have equipped we'll use the serpent arrows first of all which are the poison ones it usually takes about three or four of these serpent arrows to actually apply the poison to him so keep on popping those keeping a decent distance so we don't get caught in his crazy attacks uh poison is now applied to him and obviously tell with the green aura and his health is ticking down so that is that you could also choose to use poison pots and stuff as well so if you had some poison pots or some poison bone darts technically speaking you could get like a medium sort of distance and throw a few pots and stuff like that or some bone darts be careful of him getting a bit too close to you as long as your character is kind of facing either directly towards him or at least kind of like towards the side then the stuff that you throw should be fine but just be careful that you're not facing like the complete opposite direction otherwise it won't uh it won't work so so you could throw those uh bits and bobs like so the poison darts and the poison pots and stuff and we also have rot arrows so if we go back to the bell once again face it kind of like sideways or towards him you could also apply scarlet rot with the arrows so he's buffed his weapons uh the scarlet rot aura the red aura usually overrides the green aura of the poison and now let's buff his weapon just be careful of that particular combo there you have to jump over the last attack that sort of wave that he does this one once again just kind of dash towards your sides the red aura i believe he's got the red aura on him if i can see correctly yep so now he's got poison and he's got scarlet rot both applied at the same time so you could just use that as a strategy just have the scarlet rot and the poison from the arrows and both of those will be ticking his health down watch out for that uh shock wave once again there he goes uh and this time we'll just avoid the attack so as long as you're kind of like moving and you're not stood still then you should be fine to avoid the uh meteorite strike like that once again keep an eye on his health bar it's ticking down don't worry too much about these when he kind of summons these they stay around for a long time before he actually shoots them and you'll see the animation before they do come towards you that particular one just go to your sides like we did there but there's a smaller gravity balls i just keep on shooting the poison arrows and the scarlet rot arrows if you do fall off that's fine just back up and jump back on to torrent when you can do uh here comes the attack there you can just sort of like dodge to the sides watch out for the shock wave on that one jump over it and uh you can just keep sort of like lowering him around this arena jump over the shock wave and as you can see the his health is just ticking down the poison and the scarlet rot is just doing its thing now watch out for this one you need to kind of like dodge to the side and then dodge the side again uh to avoid that one it's a bit spicy as if like i mentioned before uh torrent does have a few iframes or invincibility frames so you kind of like dodge to the sides like so now we can see that poison is on so we want scarlet rot on as well ideally you want both of those things on at the same time so we'll pop the rot arrows to be fair the poison's pretty much just gonna take him out at this point i think watch out for the shock wave and there we go the poison has done the job so that's one option combination of poison arrows and rot arrows can do the job and that is the radar fight hopefully you enjoyed this video and it helped you

is this happening to you [Music] then you're in the right place for video game training [Music] in this video i'm going to show you how to defeat reichard if you want to be an absolute legend and support the channel then make sure to hit that like and subscribe button my name is azov azza now let's get into the video i'll just show you where this battle is on the map you want to be heading to this audience pathway site of grace and you'll see the boss fog wall right down here so let's head on inside for this fight we're going to be using the intended weapon which is this serpent hunter so make sure to pick this up after we've got the serpent hunter we're then going to open up the map and then fast travel to the round table once we're at the round table head on over to the blacksmith equip this serpent hunter weapon we're going to be leveling up the serpent hunter using somber smithing stones you may need to use some golden runes from your inventory to actually have enough runes to level it up after that talk to the blacksmith and then we're just going to level that up as much as it can go so it's gone up to plus six plus six will do for now whilst you are here level up any spirit summons that you may want to use in this fight we're going to be using ancestral followers ash plus five once that's all done head back to the audience pathway i'll just show you the setup that we're working with for this fight so we're gonna be using the serpent hunter weapon which is the intended weapon for this battle i'm actually gonna switch out my head gear i normally put this bandit mask on for fashion i'm going to put something a bit stronger and a bit more defensive on to help us through this strategy so i'm just going to pop this bad boy on as it's got better physical damage negation and also better fire damage negation so that will do for the armor and then onto the talismans we're going to be using this winged sword insignia talisman which increases our attack as long as we keep attacking we'll be using the flame drake talisman for fire damage negation we'll also be using the pearl drake talisman plus one which greatly boosts non-physical damage negation which are things like holy fire and lightning essentially with this strategy that we're going to be using we'll want to negate as much fire damage as humanly possible using a flask of wondrous physic which gives us more stamina and also boosts stamina recovery speed we might use some pickled turtleneck for increased stamina recovery speed some exalted flesh for a physical attack boost we could even use fireproof dried liver to negate fire damage even more and reichard is quite weak to frost forward slash freezing so we could also throw some freezing pots at him as well just a quick side note with the spirit summons what i would recommend ideally is try and use spirit summons that are ranged or have some kind of ranged attack because if you just use summons that have physical attacks they'll just run straight into the lava right in front of reichard and die quite quick if you want to you can also use a rune arc to activate your great rune just be aware that rune arcs are not infinite so be careful with how many runarchs you use after you've used one you will always have the benefit of the great rune unless you die in which case you'll then lose your benefits you have to go back into your inventory use a runark again to regain the benefits of that great rune so first of all just make sure that you're holding the serpent hunter with two hands so i'm pressing y and then rb to switch between two hands and one hand so we want to be holding this with two hands for this battle okay so let's jump into the fight itself we're gonna hold on to the spirit ashes until phase two and the flask until phase two so phase one we're gonna use exalted flesh and then fireproof dried liver get the freezing pot ready run on in you can throw one of these at his face for some big damage then we're gonna roll forward just to where this kind of like weird cut thing is right at the front here so you want to be really really close as close as you can get and just keep on smashing away with this serpent hunter watch out for that spin to him it might knock you back sometimes you can roll to avoid it and sometimes you can also block it as well but don't worry about it too much to make sure your health is looking decent we've knocked him down for a few free hits so we can keep on smashing away and basically as long as you stay in this particular place right here you are relatively safe just the spin to win that need to watch out for like that it's okay just roll back into position pop a flask keep on smashing away we still got 11 healing flasks that's pretty much the end of phase one what we'll do is back up we're gonna re-buff up and whip out the spirit ashes some fireproof dried liver if we can pop it in and now we are on to phase two same kind of thing just run back in keep on smashing away same kind of position it gets a little bit crazier and there's one particular attack we need to look out for in this phase which is the one where it kind of like rains down exploding skulls if your health is about halfway definitely pop a flask also watch out for the that one just there like the jump attack in phase two that he does so it's the jump attack and the sort of like raining down explosive skulls he jumps away get back up close and personal same kind of position as before a lot of the attacks will just completely miss there's one the one that i'm talking about is where he kind of like glows a weird red color which might happen soon if he does that one we need to do something different you might actually get through this phase without seeing that attack at all but i am going to kind of wait a bit because i do want him to do it so i can actually show you the attack although technically we probably could keep on smashing away and finish him off i think he's going to do it soon that's the jump you can roll technically to avoid that jump as we just uh timed it quite well there to avoid it give you some time but basically if you just stay in that same position right there you got the ancestral follower that's kind of like shooting from afar and we're just gonna give him some time and hope for the sort of like rain down skull attack which he should do there we go that's the one i'm talking about so what we're gonna do for that one is pop a pickled turtle neck or the flask and we are gonna run this is where like loads and loads of red skulls will just keep raining down for a long time um as long as we are running we should avoid all of those scores kind of got grabbed there but that's fine so watch out for that make sure you are running running running and all of the scores will completely miss it also charge up a big attack so be careful of that uh like charge where it kind of like puts his sword towards the sky uh what you can do technically is if you see that sword attack in coming you can actually hide behind one of these columns that you see at the back there so you can avoid that by if you're running away from the exploding skulls you can actually hide behind one of the giant columns specifically for the sword strike attack and it will actually hit the column instead of hitting you but other than that basically just keep running to avoid those skulls if you're lucky then you won't even get the raining down skulls attack at all obviously we got grabbed by the snake as well so just keep an eye on the snake itself and try to sort of like roll through the grab attack to avoid that other than that just get yourself back into that position just next to this cut right here keep on jabbing away and that is the fight hopefully you enjoyed this video and it helped you out in some way if it did remember to like subscribe and drop a comment you can check out all the other content that i make at azovar.com

Title: How To Easily Defeat Mohg - Elden Ring

is this happening to you then you're in the right place for video game training [Music] in this video i'm going to show you how to defeat moog lord of blood if you want to be an absolute legend and support the channel then make sure to hit that like and subscribe button my name is azov azza now let's get into the video i'll just show you where this boss fight is located so it's underground and the closest sight of grace is this dynasty mausoleum midpoint and the boss is located just here i'll show you the setup that we're working with for this fight so we have two keen symmeters plus 17 we have a serpent's bow along with that bow we'll also be using serpent arrows which cause poison build up and we might also use some scarlet rot arrows we'll be using the finger sacred seal and along with that sacred seal we'll be using this incantation called rotten breath there is a very small chance that we'll use a shield so i'll just show you the shield that we're using with the talismans we've got an arsenal charm which raises our maximum equipment load we've got the wing sword insignia which raises our attack power as long as we keep on attacking and we've also got the green turtle talisman which raises our stamina recovery speed if you want to see how to get a lot of this equipment including the serpent bell and the rotten breath i'd recommend watching the start of my redan boss guide video as i show you where to pick up quite a lot of stuff at the start of that video we're also rocking the crucible knight armor set i do have a video on how to get that as well if you're interested and an insanely important part of this setup is the flask of wondrous physic specifically the crystals that we mix into this flask the most important one is the purifying crystal tear which nullifies the curse that happens halfway through this boss fight i've made a video on how to get the purifying crystal tear i'll link that in the youtube pop-up cards we're using the speckled hard tier which raises all resistances which are things like poison scarlet rut blood loss and frostbite specifically for this fight we want to protect against blood loss and that's why we use this speckled hard tier if you wanted to get the speckled hard tier you would have to go to this minor urge tree in the altus plateau and defeat the worm face boss another insanely important item is moog's shackle you can use this two times in phase one of the battle and when you use this shackle it will make moog fall down to the floor for a good few seconds and we'll be using this to our advantage in this fight i have made a video on how to get moog shackle so i'll link that in the youtube pop-up cards as well you could also use some invigorating cured meat which boosts robustness which protects against blood loss and even though moog is the lord of blood he's actually quite weak to blood loss so we're going to be popping some blood grease onto our weapon and inflicting blood loss on him and generally is also quite weak to physical attacks we might also throw some poison pots and some poison darts depending on the situation if you've got some you could bring in some of the boluses that alleviate blood loss and we'll be using the ancestral follower spirit ash which is probably not the best ash to be totally honest but it's the best ash that i've got so it's the one that i'm going to be using we also will pop one of these starlight shards which allows us to gradually recover our fp and we'll also pop an exalted flesh which boosts our physical attack you could also choose to use a flame drake talisman or a flame drake talisman plus one to negate the fire damage because in phase two there'll be a lot of fire all over the floor and this will help you negate a lot of that damage i would recommend having the serpent's bow and moogues shackle at the ready as we'll be using that very early on with all that being said let's jump into the fight first of all lock on and then run backwards and left use your spirit ashes about there go to your inventory use the starlight shards and then you kind of want to head in this motion like backwards and right while shooting these poison arrows or certain arrows you might do like a little side step thing so just be careful of that just need to keep popping these essentially until poison is applied which should be quite soon and then we need to switch to the sacred seal so roughly around now so i'm going to switch to the sacred seal and use rotten breath i might tank a hit here that's fine we go so we're going to use the shackle for the first time switch to the blue flask and use rotten breath a second time ideally if we can do i'll use rotten breath three times possible with a lot of his attacks you have to delay your roll quite a lot i'm gonna go back to the blue flask then use rotten breath a third time then we're gonna switch to exalted flesh and swords so pop the flesh blood grease right tank a hit there to apply it that's fine if that's the case then we're going to heal up get the shackle at the ready shackle about now get up close and personal and do as much damage as humanly possible at this point just keep on going get the flask at the ready he's about to phase change so you want to flask about there keep on attacking doing as much damage as you possibly can do usually jumps up into the air quite soon and sort of like roll forward to avoid that you can also use that chance to heal up you could switch to your belt at this point the serpent bell and you could try and reapply scarlet rot or poison to him you get some distance like so and keep on popping some of these arrows i think he's still got a little bit of scarlet rot at the minute but probably not poisoned so i'm gonna shoot some of the poison arrows and try and reapply poison to him i think has reapplied i'm not quite yet but it's still doing some decent damage i'm kind of using the arena to kind of like go up to the top section there and then back down to the bottom section using the length of the arena to get this tactic done technically speaking you can fight him up close and personal as well if you want to do that now the choice is yours but the poison is reapplied uh obviously the actual shots from the arrows still do damage as well uh which is really good the poison is ticking his health down so once again just using the arena to kind of like lure him from one side to the other that's kind of like rolling and running in the opposite direction trying to pop a shot in here and there there we go that's the fight i just wanted to show you a couple of extra bits and bobs for example you can poison him using poison bone darts or poison pots if that's a better option for you then feel free to go for it just keep on throwing these you might need to back up and kind of like roll backwards here and there if he gets a little bit too close eventually you should poison him like so next i'll go over some of his physical attacks and his blood attacks with his physical attacks the ones with the trident technically speaking you can block them although i would recommend rolling them as opposed to blocking them because they do insane levels of stamina damage and you want to delay your roll very very slightly for these trident attacks for most of the trident attacks that particular blood attack there is kind of like a downwards swipe and for that one you want to roll either left or right this one has got a very long delay so he does like one swing and then the second one is delayed a lot more and he usually follows it up with a quicker third strike as well if he does this one where kind of like rains down blood it just makes sure to stand out the way of the rain in blood and you should be fine what you'll find is that his move set is quite similar in phase one and in phase two so the timing of his attacks will be the same so if you can practice and learn the stuff in phase one you should find it a little bit easier in phase two to avoid his attacks with these circles that are around our character he'll do three of them that's the second one just put onto our character now what you want to do is to make sure to use your shackle two times before the third circle is put around our character as soon as the third circle is on like so you can't use your shackle anymore and straight after the third circle it goes straight into his phase change you can use these boluses to take away the blood build up like so his move set in phase two will be quite similar to phase one you just gotta be aware of all of the blood and fire that's coming off the end of his trident so watch out for that on top of that it's also now got wings so you got to be aware of the extra aerial attacks technically speaking in phase two what you could do is switch out your talismans for example you could take off the turtle talisman and pop something on increases bow and arrow damage so if you wanted to stick to more of a ranged strategy you could kind of like switch out your talismans real quick but yeah other than that that is the fight and hopefully that extra information helps

is this happening to you then you're in the right place for video game training [Music] in this video i'm going to show you how to defeat the fire giant if you want to be an absolute legend and support the channel then make sure to hit that like and subscribe button my name is azov azza now let's get into the video i'll just show you where this boss is located on the map so the closest sight of grace is this one foot of the forge and then the actual fire giant will be here and the setup that we're using for this fight is two keen scimitars plus 22 we've got a serpent's bow we've got the finger sacred seal so we can use the rotten breath incantation we are also bringing along a shield although to be fair we probably won't use the shield in this fight but the talismans were using the er trees favor plus one which raises maximum hp stamina and equipment load we're using the winged sword insignia which raises attack power as long as we keep attacking green turtle talisman which increases stamina recovery speed and flame drake talisman plus one which greatly boosts fire damage negation you could also choose to use the pearl drake talisman or the pearl drake talisman plus one which greatly boosts non-physical damage negation which are things like magic fire lightning and holy and technically could stack the pearl drake talisman alongside the flame drake talisman to get really good fire resistance the fire giant is quite weak to lightning and magic so we'll be popping some lightning grease or some magic grease onto our weapons so feel free to use any lightning or magic attacks you could even throw lightning or magic pots as well he can also be poisoned and you can also apply scarlet rot to him you could also choose to use spirit ashes if you want to they will tank a few hits and the fire giant does have an insane amount of hp so your spirit ashes could come in useful okay so with all that being said let's jump into the fight so you want to be on torrent first of all and run on up to him he'll usually do like an avalanche launch attack like this where he kind of launches that snow using the plate you can dismount torrent like that you get a couple of invincibility frames so you can actually avoid the snow and then what we'll do is whip out some spirit summons for a little bit of a distraction and we're gonna be applying poison to him first of all with the serpent bow so we're just gonna get underneath his booty like so lock on you can lock on to either his feet or you can lock on to his chest we kind of just want to be just underneath his butt just being aware of his movements and trying to avoid the plate slams and stuff like that so once you see his health is ticking down we've got poison applied so that's good and then next we're going to switch to the sacred seal and use some rotten breath once again just underneath his booty use a blue flask he's gonna it's probably gonna slam us no he missed that's good um but i was willing to sort of like trade some damage there so we could apply scarlet rock so gonna use all those um rotten breaths that is that then i'm gonna go back to the serpent bell just kind of staying around that similar area and like just behind him popping in those shots uh you can the shackle will break off he starts doing some extra bits and bobs now so he gets access to a few more attacks at this point you can also jump off torrent and attack on foot if you want to so we'll try and do a little bit of that just got to be aware of those uh sort of like fire orbs at this point they're quite spicy so uh what a good thing to do is with the fire orbs is to try and bait them to explode and then move out the way uh so with this bit here just want to be aware of the fire and try and avoid it not like that so we'll get on foot i'm going to apply some magic grease to our weapon to buff our damage and now we've got phase change so basically at this phase the best thing to do is tickle this foot and once again watch out for the fire you can tickle the foot whilst the fire is exploding you just got to be very very careful of it stay by the foot keep on tickling you can use some food to buff your uh attack power and stuff like that so with the uh floating orbs the floating fire orbs um basically when they get close to your character they'll take a second or so and then they'll explode uh so what you can do is kind of like bait them close to you expect the explosion and then try and get out of there uh if he rolls away like that basically just pop back onto torrent get back over to his toes give him a tick up these are fire orbs here so if we get close you'll see that animation once you see that animation you know that they're going to explode so bait it see the animation and then get out of there once again back get back to the foot give it a bit of a tickle he's rolling away mount back up get back over to the foot we'll try and rebuff if possible you could also reapply uh scarlet rot or poison if you wanted to at this point but usually it's safer just to stay melee at this point and just try and tickle the foot really with your swords so if you can you can get in some attacks there uh as long as you can avoid the fire if not just back up and get out of there get back to the foot a lot of time he'll try and like roll away so he'll try and get away um if you're by his foot like this so just be prepared to basically like like that and you've got the fire orbs like so bait them to explode get back on turret back to the foot i just rinse and repeat really like i mentioned before it does have an insane amount of hp so um you know sometimes you just gotta be patient and uh keep on trucking really but um you keep getting back to that foot like that and then just giving him a little bit of a tickle on his foot you'll get there in no time and that is the fight hopefully you enjoyed this video and it helped you out in some way if it did remember to like subscribe and

is this happening to you then you're in the right place for video game training [Music] in this video i'm going to show you how to defeat the godskin duo if you want to be an absolute legend and support the channel then make sure to hit that like and subscribe button my name is azov azza now let's get into the video i'll just show you where this boss is located on the map just located at this crumbling faram azula the boss itself is located just here you'll likely approach the boss fight from this dragon at temple site of grace however there is a sight of grace that's a bit better and you won't have to run past all these nights every time you die if you go to this other one so to get to the other side of grace that's a bit closer you'll have to do a running jump off of here down to these stairs and then fall down again then we need to run past a bunch of enemies in this direction and head right watch out for these bad boys you can just run past or you can fight them it's up to you and we need to be heading left at this point and then dropping down again just over that ledge and then if we look forward we've got the secret sight of grace there's two main bonuses for using this side of grace one is the run back to the boss fight is literally just up here and you can also get access to an npc co-operator that will jump into the fight with you as well what you can do if it's the first time that you're approaching this boss fight and you're approaching it from the dragon temple side of grace is go to this balcony first of all and then jump off and run forward to initiate the boss fight but just keep in mind if you've already started the boss fight and then there's a fog wall just here you can't actually get through this particular fog wall so we'll have to do is kind of like go over that way down the stairs and then go through the fog wall on the side of the arena instead of this one i'll just show you the setup that we're using for this fight so we've got two keen symmeters we've got a serpent's bow we've got a finger sacred seal which we might use for rotten breath to apply scarlet rot we've got the golden beast crest shield and a good shield that can come in really handy in this fight for the talismans we've got earth trees favor plus one which raises maximum hp stamina and equipment load we've got the wing sword insignia which raises our attack power as long as we keep on attacking the green turtle talisman for increased stamina recovery speed the viridian amber medallion plus one which greatly raises maximum stamina we'll also be popping our flask for increased stamina regen as well as more stamina exalted flesh to raise our physical attack you can get some good damage in with blood loss so we'll be applying blood grease to our weapon magical attacks also do some decent damage so if you've got any magical attacks on magic grease feel free to use that you can also apply poison to them so you can throw some poison parts some poison bone darts or you could use poison arrows and we've got 11 sleep pots at the ready as you can actually put them to sleep using sleep pot costs a little bit of fp so for that reason we've also got two blue flasks with us you could also choose to use spirit ash's forward slash spirit summons which serve as a good distraction so feel free to do that we'll be whipping out the ancestral follower ashes okay so with all that being said let's jump into the fight first of all you can pop on some magic grease get the sleep pots ready head over this direction whip out the spirit ashes and then we want to be throwing sleep parts at this bad boy over here you can use these columns as defense this guy is usually quite good at dodging the sleep pot so you might have to throw a few before you actually get one that connects he's now completely asleep so just ignore him and focus on this enemy over here so next we'll whip out the serpent bow and the serpent arrows to poison him and what we'll try and do is i want this guy to ideally break this column so i can show you some of the stuff that we can do with the column use it as defense so we'll lock back on here we go i think you should break it quite soon so what you can do is not for this particular attack when he does this sonic adventure rolling around at the speed of sound attack um he'll just roll straight over the column so you can't really use it as defense uh but for all the other attacks like when they throw uh that black flame it would just tank the black flame for us the other guy is still asleep you can shoot your arrows over the top of the broken column to get any damage so we're currently shooting poison arrows just back up a little bit if he does that crazy 7000 jab attack with his sword and that's him now dead just be careful of the uh like i say the sonic adventure like rolling around at the speed of sound thing because it'll just go straight over the top of the column this guy is back awake but if you want to you can just throw another pot popping back to sleep and you can buy yourself some time what we'll do next is use exalted flesh and we'll whip out these swords put some blood grease on and i'll just show you the blood grease in action we could also use war cry for a little bit of extra buff although it takes away the sword buff so i'll reapply that and as you can see you get insane amounts of time if they're asleep you can just literally stand there you know use all your buffs all that kind of stuff once again you can sleep pot at this bad boy um this one is not as good at dodging the sleep parts as the other one but same kind of thing you can just apply your blood grease or your magic grease to your weapon and just completely delete him with a few strikes there's not really much left on the health bar there to be fair but another sleep part uh for that attack there where they really throw the uh black flame if you've got some distance between you and them you can just kind of like dodge to your right or left and you'll completely avoid it uh but yeah feel free to just pop your war cries your grease rebuff exalted flesh and um get slicing away and that is the fight hopefully you

is this happening to you then you're in the right place for video game training [Music] in this video i'm going to show you how to defeat malacath the black blade if you want to be an absolute legend and support the channel then make sure to hit that like and subscribe button my name is azov azza now let's get into the video i'll just show you where this boss is located on the map so you can find him at the crumbling faram azula malakath is just here and the closest site of grace would be this one which is beside the great bridge there will be a draconic tree sentinel just in front of the boss arena technically speaking you can skip the draconic tree sentinel if you want to i do also have a draconic tree sentinel boss fight guide if you're interested i'll link that in the pop-up cards i'll just show you the setup that we're using for this boss so we have two key insimitors plus 25 we've got a serpent's bow and we'll be using serpent's arrows to apply poison we've got the golden beast crest shield plus 25 and this has 100 physical damage negation this is classed as a great shield and it only requires 24 strength to use we'll also be using the finger sacred seal so we can use rotten breath and apply scarlet rot we've got the crucible knights armor set for the talismans we've got er trees favor plus one which raises maximum hp stamina and equipment load we've got the great shield talisman which boosts our guardian ability the green turtle tasman which raises stamina recovery speed and the dragon crest shield talisman plus two which vastly boosts physical damage negation we've got 12 of the red flasks and 2 of the blue flasks in the flask of wondrous physic we've got the crimson burst crystal tier and the green burst crystal tier the crimson burst crystal tier is very useful for phase 2 because it steadily restores our hp over time so it's got like a hp regen effect that's really good to counter attack malacath's black blade because if you get hit by malacath's blade then it will tick your hp down and this crimson burst crystal tier will tick your hp up so it helps with that aspect of the fight if you want to get that hp regen crystal tier that is located here on the map at the weeping peninsula you'll have to defeat the urgery avatar to get the crystal tier we'll also be using exalted flesh to boost our physical attack i will also pop on some fire grease to increase our attack even more it's not really weak to fire magic lightning or anything like that but if you do use some grease it can buff your attacks a little bit although it is quite resistant to holy so don't use holy grease malakath is quite weak to physical attacks so if you can get up close and personal and start slicing and smashing away you should do some decent damage you could also use this unique item called blasphemous claw this claw is designed specifically for this fight it can parry the black blade on specific attacks it can only parry the attacks where his blade glows a gold colour i'll just show you on the map where you can get this blasphemous claw from so you'll have to head here what you'll have to do is go from this great bridge in this direction to the north keep on following this around and then head outside to the right and then down these ladders and then when you get to this part here you'll be invaded by this npc called banal you'll have to fight and defeat him to get the claw what you might find is if you're not being invaded by the npc then generally it will mean you have to go to a volcano manor and have a conversation with him here so make sure to talk to this guy a few times if you're not getting the invasion this is located just next to the volcano manor site of grace you could also choose to use some spirit summons forward slash spirit ashes if you want to we're gonna be using the ancestral follower ashes plus nine although just keep in mind in phase two it's very likely that your spirit ashes will get deleted by malakath pretty quick with all that being said let's jump into the fight okay so first of all we're gonna whip out the spirit ashes roughly around there and then use our serpent's bow with our poisonous arrows fire off a few shots and then when he gets close we want to switch to our shield you can use barricade shield for a little bit of extra defense and ideally we want to be kind of moving in this direction if poison hasn't applied yet you can also pop some shots from here you want to get close to this column here use it as defense we're going to swag the blue flask and then we're going to use scarlet rot to apply i'm going to use rotten breath sorry to apply scarlet rot and then get back behind the column use exalted flesh and next we're going to switch to sword and shield fire grease head on up and ideally we want to hit him with two charged attacks at this point so hold down right trigger that's one we'll try for two i think we got him with two so the third one if we run to here hold down right trigger hit him with a third charged attack it will knock him down straight away you can follow that up then we're going to get close use the flask so we've got our hp is now regenerating shield up barricade shield so we just switched to the key item there just as the gold blade was on its way towards us and we parried that so as you can see that's pretty much the fight just need to give him a quick pop to finish that off and that is the fight i will go over some more details and attacks okay so next i'll show you a few extra bits and bobs first we'll take a look at a couple of things that you can do at the start of phase two so once again at the start of phase two run to this line hold down right trigger and then if you can get that third charged attack in which will knock him down and you can always get a critical strike in there and you can apply your flask here or rebuff you could also use this opportunity to heal up if you want to just run forward and pop your flask next we'll take a look at the ranged aerial slashers and with these we essentially need to be counting how many ranged aerial slashes that he does depending on how many he does he will do a different thing afterwards so if he does three ranged aerial slashers he's gonna follow that up with a golden blade double spin to win attack if you've got the blasphemous claw at the ready then use that as he's on his way down to you and you should get the parry giving you loads of uptime on the boss if you don't have the blasphemous claw at the ready you could choose to roll in the direction that malakath was coming from and it should roll through the attack and help you avoid it if he does two of the ranged aerial slashes he'll then follow that up with like a sword plunge into the floor this is another golden blade attack that you can use the claw to get your parry on as well once again if you don't have the claw at the ready then just roll away and try to avoid it and if you just does one of the ranged aerial slashers he usually doesn't follow that up with anything at all so make sure to count how many ranged aerial slashes that he does and then react accordingly you could also use that time to heal up or reapply your buffs or whatever it is that you want to do sometimes you might do the golden sword plunge into the floor directly from the column so if he is up on a column just keep your eyes peeled because you might do that and of course you can parry that as well once again you can use these columns as a lot of defense so if you need to buff up heal up reapply any bits and bobs just get behind the columns and pop those these columns will also block his ranged aerial slashes so you can hide behind those to avoid those with a lot of his attacks just having your shield up is insanely useful just keep an eye on our stamina and health bar here as you can see the shield is tanking a lot of that damage once again check out the stamina and health bar shoot up took a little bit of damage there but not too much a good opportunity to punish him is his slow overhead sword slam so he kind of like holds his sword up in the air for a second and then kind of slams it down gives you a good two or three seconds to put in some attacks watch out for this sword jam into the floor attack if he jumps on the sword like that it's always going to explode so make sure to get out of the way for the multi slash combo either try and get behind him and if you can get behind him safely you can put in quite a lot of attacks or you could put your shield up and try to block as many attacks as you can or you could choose to just roll and try and get out the way the best you can either one of those would work but if you want to get some damage in then try to get behind him so you can punish he also does a raw attack which knocks you back a few meters this one is nothing to worry about but yeah other than that that is the fight and hopefully that extra information helps

is this happening to you then you're in the right place for video game training [Music] in this video i'm going to show you how to defeat godfrey the first elden lord if you want to be an absolute legend and support the channel then make sure to hit that like and subscribe button my name is azov azza now let's get into the video i'll just show you where this boss is located so it's located here at the base of the earth tree the closest site of grace will be the queen's bedchamber and i'll just show you the setup that we're using for this fight so we have two key incinerators plus 25 we've got a serpent's bow and we'll be using serpent's arrows to apply poison we've got the golden beast crest shield and this has 100 physical damage negation this also has the ash of war called barricade shield applied to it we'll be using the finger sacred seal so we can use rotten breath and rotten breath applies scarlet rot we're using the crucible knights armor set and for the talismans we've got arrow sting talisman which raises the attacks of our arrows kindred of rocks talisman which increases our attack if there's poison or scarlet rot in the area green tear or talisman which raises stamina recovery speed dragon crest shield tasman plus two which vastly boosts physical damage negation we've got 12 of the red flasks and two of the blue flasks in the flask of wondrous physic we've got the crimson burst crystal tier and the green burst crystal tier we might use some food buffs for example exalted flesh which boosts our physical attack and pickled turtle neck which boosts our stamina recovery speed i will also pop on some fire grease to do some extra damage it's not really weak to any grease like magic fire or lightning but you can pop those greases on to do a little bit of extra damage although he does have a bit of resistance to holy so we won't be using holy grease we'll also pop some starlight shards at the start of the battle which gradually recover our fp and you could also use some spirit ash forward slash spirit summons we'll be using ancestral follow ashes plus nine what you can do to make this fight a lot easier is actually save and quit instantly at the start of the battle then load back into the game and when you load back in you'll be outside the fog gate so this time if we enter the arena we've got absolutely loads of time to lock on and start shooting our poison arrows and stuff like that i'm going to show you two slight variants on how to deal with phase two one is a bit more offensive and one is a bit more defensive okay so let's jump into the fight first of all we'll pop the starlight shards then we'll jump into the arena use our spirit ashes now we need to lock on try and land roughly about five poison arrows as the fight starts so that should do and then we'll switch to the sacred seal and we'll apply scarlet rot next pop that bad boy get ready to block or dodge you can also whip out the shield here and block those attacks so it's now got poison and scarlet rot applied to him so we're going to use the flask exalted flesh switch to sword and shield apply fire grease and you could play offensively or defensively here so if you want to play offensively go for double swords defensively go for the great shield watch out for this fischer because it hurts a lot you can jump over that foot stump try and show you some of the guard counters here and the stance breaks so shield up hold down right trigger there hit him with a charged attack trying to show you some more guard counters shield up guard counter and you can stance break him like so this will push him into phase two so at the start of phase two usually you start a little bit closer to him but sometimes for some reason it glitches out and puts you a bit further back uh usually if he roars he jumps up and goes into his earth shaker attack ideally what we want to do is apply poison or scarlet rot to him so i'm gonna go ahead and use rotten breath and tank whatever hits he gives us it's usually worth tanking whatever attack he does in exchange for applying scarlet rot even if it means that he like powerbombs you like exactly like that if you keep an eye on his health it is ticking down he's got the red aura around him so that's basically what we want to achieve is his health ticking down and then all we have to do really for the rest of this is run around the arena if your raw is going to jump up you jump twice while it's running away you could also if you want to be cheeky you can also try and apply poison to him again this one you want to jump over it and again if he does that it buffs his stumps so he's got that kind of crazy aura around him and uh if he's got that crazy aura it means that all of his stumps are going to be arena wide so usually when he roars he goes into that earth shaker type move uh but it doesn't do it all the time other than that basically you can just run around the arena like this if you look at his health it's basically on the way out so you just do this there's the raw it's gonna jump up you jump once jump twice and then roll avoided earthshaker if you want to do some extra damage you can shoot some arrows at him and potentially reapply poison but other than that that is the fight i'm just going to show you an extra trick that you can do if you do stance breaking so i'm going to get in some charge attacks and some guard counters so we can a stance break that's two charge attacks guard counter you can pop a flask like that and then you can also get in the critical strike afterwards so keep that in mind if you need to pop an extra flask okay so i'm just going to show you a bit more of an offensive type strategy with the double swords this time around we've got the flask of wondrous physics still applied to watch out for this fisher and we've buffed up with the fire grease and stuff if you're gonna go in for double swords then a lot of it is kind of just like jumping and rolling and dodging all the bits and bobs that he does jump over that foot stomp run in get the double sword slicing away so jump the foot stomp like that it usually goes into a combo of sorts afterwards you can punish there jump over watch out for the kind of like wind-ups on a lot of his attacks that fisher also does a hell of a lot of damage to watch out for that jump over and then at the start of phase two run forward and kind of like around him and you can attack him from behind so basically with this phase one of the best things to do if you want to be up close and personal is just be kind of like behind him but don't lock on so just kind of like rolling around like that attacking once or twice here and there the raw will knock you down so watch out for that watch out for this earth shaker if you're close the earth shaker is quite difficult to uh dodge but yeah just basically um sort of like rolling around whilst being behind him usually works quite well and the double swords physical damage does quite a lot of damage may take a hit like here and there just make sure to you know keep an eye on your health and keep topping up accordingly other than that just keep getting behind him right behind his butt popping in your attacks here and there watch out for the raw use that chance to heal up the earth shaker once again if you're close like this the earth shaker is a bit spicy but you can roll through it like that watch out for this one ideally for that you kind of want to be rolling towards kind of like behind him or to the sides of him to avoid that like that i might get grabbed by it here and there just keep on behind him like so and pop in your attacks that is one way to deal with him but yeah other than that that is the fight and hopefully that extra information helps

is this happening to you then you're in the right place for video game training [Music] in this video i'm going to show you how to defeat radagon and the elden beast if you want to be an absolute legend and support the channel then make sure to hit that like and subscribe button my name is azov azza now let's get into the video i'll just show you where this boss is located on the map there inside the earth tree and the closest site of grace will be the elden throne i'll show you the setup that we're using for this fight so we have two keen symmeters plus 25 we've got the golden beast crest shield that has 100 physical damage negation and this also has the ash of war barricade shield on it we've got the finger sacred seal so we can use the incantation rotten breath and apply scarlet rut we're using the crucible knights armor set for the talismans we've got dragon crest shield plus 2 which vastly boosts physical damage negation we've got the wing sword insignia which raises attack power as long as we keep on attacking the green turtle talisman which boosts stamina recovery speed and we've also got the helix drake talisman plus 2 which vastly boosts holy damage negation and radagon and the elden beast mostly do holy damage so this halluck drake talisman comes in very handy i'll just show you where you can get this hallek drake talisman plus two it's in the shifa river and the closest sight of grace will be this palace approach ledge road the actual talisman itself will be towards this cliff edge just on this body here we've got 12 of the red flasks and two of the blue in the flask of wondrous physic we've got the crimson burst crystal tier and the green burst crystal tier we may use some exalted flesh for physical attack increase and pickled turtle neck to increase stamina recovery speed the pickled turtle neck will come in insanely useful against the elden beast because we'll be doing a lot of running around and jumping radagon has the least amount of resistance to fire so we'll be applying fire grease to our weapon also radagon and the elden beast are very resistant to holy so don't use holy grease and you could also choose to use spirit summons forward slash spirit ash we'll be using the ancestral follower ashes plus nine you could also choose to use some starlight shards just before you enter the arena and that will gradually restore your fp okay so let's jump into the fight first of all we'll pop these starlight shards so our fp is now regenerating and then we'll go into the arena lock on whip out the spirit ashes and then go for the rotten breath ideally the first thing we want to do is apply scarlet rot to him we might need to tank a few hits to make that happen but that's fine we need to use the blue flask so now is a good time to do that pop the rotten breath that's the second one sometimes it takes two and sometimes it takes three to apply these scarlet rot uh we can see that it has applied his health is ticking down so i'm gonna use the flask of wondrous physic exalted flesh fire grease then go for sword and shield at this point i'll show you some stance breaking and some guard counters stuff like that you'll shield up let's keep on guard countering this one might knock us back but it doesn't do too much damage with the shield up just roll through that one usually roll on the four seconds for that attack from the air there charles attack i guess as the stance break you can also pop a quick flask there whilst he's getting up if you need to go and counter guard counter again watch your stamina this one you can punish quite a lot roll through attack roll through attack a few times roll through again and you can even get a charge attack there at the end as well so as you can see the shield is uh it's pretty good with the guard counters and stuff uh you can to break him quite easily yeah charge back in there as he's getting up and that's uh radagon so we'll pop fire grease pick or turtle neck and then eldon beast i'm gonna go for dual swords run straight behind try and get directly behind him he always opens up with like the holy breath attack so as long as you're behind you should be fine a pickled turtleneck all the way really for this part of the fight gonna top up the health a little bit uh this is a good time to rebuff and stuff when he does this elder ring attack so with this one you want to kind of like jump over that bit and then just get out of the edge of the ring before it explodes it should be fine and uh run close to him once again for that one you just want to be out of the stars as though they'll explode like that so you don't want that uh try and get close i usually tend to not lock on as well when i'm close to him like this and i'm attacking with the dual swords i'll tend to stay locked off find it a bit easier but you know do what works for you uh for this one it's either gonna be a sword in the floor no he's done the like star that kind of like follows you around so for this one basically you just want to be running a lot this is why uh the pickup turtleneck comes in insanely useful uh for the fire attack once again just run to the sides sometimes it helps if you lock on like that and again don't be in the stars there's a lot of running there as you can see so hence the pickup turtleneck try and roll through that although depending on where you are you might get hit like that try and get close to him uh for this one once again just run you should be good try and get close up to him it's a lot easier if you are uh close i'm gonna pop a heel there let's roll through getting some attacks there uh ideally you want to be out of the way of that it's quite difficult to get out of the way though if you do get hit uh with the first strike like we did so when you get kind of like caught in it it makes it difficult to to get out of it if that makes sense as it's probably going to go back into his alden ring attack at this point see what he does no i just top up your your buffs and stuff oh yeah he is uh so now once again is a good time to top up your bust and stuff at this point you kind of want to be running uh jump over these ideally don't want to get hit by them like that you can probably afford to get hit by one or if you get hit by two of those uh rings you'll most likely get caught in the explosion there so it's a lot of running around once again just keep on running ideally you need to top up the pickup turtle neck so this one you just want to roll and delay your roll uh a little bit for that last slash the first two are really really fast so this one just try and get out of the way of that and as it kind of like charges up for the explosion just want to run away from the center this one once again just keep on running sometimes it helps if you lock onto him as you're running away from that one the holy breath lock on and run to the sides directly to the sides like that to avoid that one stars same thing onto the sides roll roll roll delay a little bit and then roll that last one that's kind of most of the things that he does most of his attacks there but just be aware of your stamina on that one make sure to use your pick or turtle neck and things like that and that is the fight hopefully you enjoyed this video and it helped you out in some way if it did remember to like

Title: How To Defeat Decaying Dragon Ekzykes - Elden Ring
Video ID: ynmVpMjxDhY
Transcript Text:
is this happening to you then you're in the right place for video game training [Music] in this video i'm going to show you how to defeat decaying dragon x zekes my name is azov azza now let's get into the video i'll just show you where this boss is located on the map so it's very close to caled highway south and the boss itself is located here i'll just show you the setup that we're using for this fight so we've got two keen symmeters we've got a serpent's bow with fire arrows and serpent arrows we'll also be applying fire grease to our weapon xzx is insanely weak to fire damage and i'd also recommend bringing some preserving boluses to get rid of the scarlet rot there is actually a merchant located here where you can buy fire arrows and also preserving bonuses from okay so let's jump into the fight first of all we'll pop a pickled turtle neck and we'll lock on we'll use the serpent's bell and the serpent's arrows first of all you can do a little bit of extra damage if you do hit him in the head so feel free to lock onto the head and with a lot of this guy's attacks keeping your eyes on his animations kind of gives away what he's about to do so this one's gonna be a sort of swoop down uh you can dismount torrent you do get a few invincibility frames if you're mounting or dismounting torrent so feel free to use that to your advantage that's going to be a wing attack you can kind of see him getting the wing ready so just pull back to avoid that it's gonna keep shooting these serpent arrows and eventually apply poison so you can see his health is ticking down with the poison watch out for the bites it's not taking down loads to be fair not a massive amount of damage but it's pretty decent uh for that one there where you kind of just roars you just want to back up so scarlet rock will kind of drop down you just want to avoid it for that particular scarlet rock breath it's kind of like a straight line and then you want to just run to your left or right to avoid that one uh you can also shoot fire arrows you see a little bit of scarlet rot at sort of like on the tip of his mouth before he actually does the breath so it's a bit of a telltale sign uh telling you he's about to do rotten breath just like that gonna be a sweeping one so for the sweeping one basically i just run backwards to avoid that one try and show you some fire arrows the fire arrows do decent damage not amazing damage but they're not too bad so we'll fire a few of those that's gonna be a tail whip that's the fire arrows next i'll try and show you the fire parts it's going to be a wing attack once again if you can hit his head it does do more damage so i'll try and get some of these to connect but i guess we'll see how we go let's be very careful of that scarlet rot uh swooping attack i think so just dismount as it's coming down i'm trying to get some of these to connect they're back up that's all the uh fire parts uh that particular rotten breath attack there it kind of like stands up and then kind of breathes uh down towards the floor that one kind of like fills the whole area with scarlet rot so you just want to get far away as far away as you can really to avoid that it's going to be a sweeping one once again it's going to back up for that one then we'll go for some fire grease so another tactic that you can do is kind of like run on in shuffle that bite uh run on in on torrent like that with a fire on your weapon it's gonna be a rotten breath that's quite tricky to avoid that particular one there that's probably the spiciest one uh because if you're underneath him like we just wear you can't obviously see the scarlet rot on the tip of his mouth he kind of like flies backwards and uh breathes it down so you just want to ride out as fast as possible basically if that does happen and the stumps there is a bit of scarlet rot that kind of um comes off of his feet when he stomps it's going to be a tail whip so just back up another stump just try and get kind of like to the opposite side basically if he does a storm just try and get out the way the scarlet rock it's gonna be a bite but you can just uh sort of dodge forward to avoid it another stone just get around the opposite side and a tail whip next i'll show you on foot i personally usually go and fight this guy on foot although like i mentioned before it's quite spicy if he does that kind of like fly backwards and scarlet rot it's quite tricky to avoid that one it's gonna be the sweeping one uh so what we'll do is buff up and we'll go on in on foot just gonna wait for that to get out of the way before it's safe to go in i'm just going to move to the sides for that so generally i tend to go roughly around here it's going to be a uh sort of like turn around and bite attack there it's going to do a stump i'm just going to go on this side here to get away from it and another stump so back up a little bit probably gonna do a tail whip or a bite which is a tail whip if we're in that position you can sometimes get an attack on his head depending on timing uh so as you can see we do quite a lot of damage that's a tail whip just roll to the left sometimes you can get that strike in there on his head so because we're not uh on turret at the minute we're gonna roll that one and tail whip so just roll through [Music] just run on in just roll to the opposite foot like that basically if he does the stumps if you're fighting on foot it's gonna be a bite roll forward to avoid it and there we go that is the fight there's loads more video game tutorials bus guides

is this happening to you then you're in the right place for video game training my name is azov azza now let's get into the video what we're going to do is go in and do the full fight first of all and then we'll do a breakdown of all of her moves and then i'll show you the gear and equipment that we used for the fight okay so first of all we'll pop an exalted flesh which increases our physical attack if you do have some starlight shards you can also use those to gradually restore your fp don't worry if you don't have the starlight shards though and what we'll do first of all is use horfrost stump which usually baits her into coming to us so she kind of like jumps between passive mode and aggressive mode uh she's currently in aggressive mode we can pop that usually it baits her into using that kick which we can actually run backwards and then run forwards and punish it so she's in passive mode at the minute because she's kind of like strafing around so you want to be like this medium distance and then use horse stump if that is the case uh she's gone for a sword attack there instead of the kick try another stump there's the kick run backwards run round and punish so once her health gets a little bit lower like this just be careful because it means you can start using the flurry attack so you want to have some distance behind you so you can run away from the flurry there it is good timing so run backwards and you want to roll lock off and then roll away from the flurries and you should completely avoid it like so so we'll keep popping the [ __ ] for our stump to bait her to us hopefully she's just the kick just be aware of the arena behind you you want to have some space behind you ideally uh just in case of the flurry let's go for the sword attack sold again so just uh roll backwards to avoid these that's the kick that's the sparks combo uh ideally for that one we want to be rolling forwards and right actually for the sparks there comes the kick roll from backwards and you can punish it uh sometimes she'll try and get yourself some space by doing that you can roll backwards uh for that one and you can punish if you land uh at her feet you punish that one as well there's the sparks forward and right and then back we're a little bit late there on the backward roll but forward to right and then back for the sparks we just need to be aware of our health and distance because if she does flurry we are in a bit of a pickle there's the sparks sometimes you can roll backwards for the sparks if you are already quite far back so i'm gonna pop a heel here i'm gonna re-buff up with exalted flesh or for a stomp there's the flurry we are a bit too close there so i'm going to opt for shield instead like so so depending on your distance you can go for shield or run away depends on uh where you are you can actually get in some attacks before she pulls that one off roll backwards and punish okay so that's phase one and now on to phase two so lock off run forwards underneath her and then over here we're going to top up on the bits and bobs we'll ask i would go for pickled turtleneck in this phase for stamina as opposed to attack a lot of the attacks are quite similar you can use the same kind of strategy i should just have some extra bits and bobs in this uh phase you can still bait the kick let's be careful of the arena behind us because we want to be able to run roll through uh sometimes she'll do like an extra attack like that now in phase two the scarlet rot explosion just need to be careful in case we get a flurry just got a heel punish which is that one there so sometimes you just have to like tank that if you're and once again she can do it again it's gonna back up a little bit so we can pop the heel there we go that's the heel punish again just be careful of that one uh if you can get behind her for that you can punish watch out for the kick use the stomp she might kick if she does that's good we can always punish that kick by doing that kind of like little run around thing roll through there's the sparks roll through and just walk backwards a little bit for the kick as well uh for this one you'll ideally want to run very far away technically speaking if you can run really far away you can avoid all if not well most if not all of the attacks on that that's a good time to heal up when she's doing that one there ideally we get the kick so we can punish it this one you want to ideally run the like through her underneath her gonna pop some bits and bobs there you can also throw uh freezing pots so when she's at the end of that you can sometimes get some freezing pots in uh if you do get a proc on a freezing pot then uh there's the flurry we're way too close so we're going to lock on and go for the shield option instead sparks and again sparks we rolled the wrong way there for the sparks but that's okay it's not the end of the world if you do uh run the wrong way for the sparks that's the grab so forward and right and then back for sparks like that uh once again run underneath and away this is a great time to use all your bits and bobs so you use whatever you've got to and once again if you can get some freezing pots in sometimes if they proc they do decent damage like that roll through roll through and punish watch out for the kick always knocks you down if she's kind of idling or in passive mode you can bait her towards you by using the horse stump so feel free to use that to your advantage once again it's going to run straight through and roll again try some freezing parts okay so we are kind of out of most things you can also punish this if you can get up and kind of like do a few attacks at the end of it like so and that is the fight next let's break down the moves so baiting her kick attack and then punishing it is basically using thrust stomp looking out to see if she's going to use the kick and then you want to back up a little bit or run backwards a little bit and then run forwards and attack if it works you should be able to punish you can still punish her kick without using the horse stump it's just a lot of the time by using the stump it does bait her into doing the kick allowing us to punish next we'll take a look at the sparks combo you've got sparks combo 1 and sparks combo 2. to avoid sparks combo 1 you want to roll forwards and right and then roll immediately backwards to avoid sparks combo 2 you still want to roll forwards and right the first time and then wait a little bit then roll backwards the sound of the blade sparks is slightly different between version one and version two version one is a quicker sparks sound and version two is a slower sound this is specifically the spark sound that is after the initial three swipes of the combo i'll play an example here so you can hear the difference after she finishes the sparks combo 2 she usually does stay still for about a second or two allowing you to heal or punish with the grab attack you'll kind of see her ready her hand in front of her and then she'll pull her hand behind her signaling that the grab attack is on its way with this grab attack you kind of have to judge the distance between you and melania and then time your role accordingly she's got a jump up and stab attack she usually uses this one as a heel punish although it's not always used as a heel punish and this move has got very accurate tracking if you can angle your roll so that when you finish your roll you end up at the feet of melania you can then use that chance to get in some extra attacks or if you need to heal up you could roll through her towards the direction that the attack is coming from we should then buy you a second or two to pop a flask you can actually throw a freeze pot to interrupt melania's fluorite attack and completely stop her from doing it however you do need to be insanely quick at throwing this freeze pot as soon as you see the animation start up you probably get less than a second to throw it and a lot of the time i usually find that i'm a touch late and i end up getting killed by the flurry so i wouldn't recommend that one as a massively consistent strategy but feel free to give it a go and see if it works for you next we'll take a look at evading the flurry completely to make this work you have to have a bit of distance between you and melania already as the flurry starts and then as soon as you do see the flurry start you want to be sprinting backwards as fast as you can do the first flurry should miss completely and then for the second flurry roll backwards through it and it should avoid that second flurry it's worth mentioning that i do tend to stay locked on for the first flurry and then the second flurry after we've rolled through the second flurry i then tend to lock off and roll forward and then keep on rolling away in the opposite direction to where melania is sometimes melania will kind of pop in a backwards and left direction and sometimes she will pop in a backwards and right direction so just try to keep an eye on the direction that she has popped over to and then roll in the opposite direction to that this one does take a lot of practice to get it right but if you give it some time you'll get it if you find that you're really close to melania as she starts up the flurry i would highly recommend going for a shield and blocking the attack rather than trying to avoid it we use a great shield that has barricade shield ashes of war which gives us a high level of defense unfortunately if you do have to block the flurry it will mean that she restores her hp but it's better for us to be alive and still in the fight and her restore her hp then us get absolutely obliterated and taken out of the fight if you are tanking this flurry in phase 2 be very aware of the scarlet rot build up definitely bring those preserving boluses after the scarlet rot explosion if you time it right you can run in and punish quite a bit you just got to be careful not to run in too early or you will take some damage and you will get some scarlet rot build up it's kind of when the scarlet rot animation is kind of wilting out and fading out is the right time to run in and with the phantom spirits attack what i tend to do is if i'm really close to melania when this attack is starting up i'll just choose to use the shield and put up barricade shield if we have enough fp to use it because our shield is a big tanky shield and it also has 100 physical damage negation we will literally take no damage whatsoever by tanking all of these hits and when the phantoms do hit us it doesn't actually restore her hp but if melania does hit us then it does restore her hp if you already have quite a lot of distance between you and melania as this attack starts up then you can actually just choose to run away and keep on running and you should avoid every single attack if there's not quite enough distance to run away then you might get clipped by one or two attacks technically speaking you could roll through every single one of these phantom spirit attacks however the timing on the rolls is quite tricky i personally tend to find that i end up getting hit by at least one or two that's why i usually opt for the shield or just run really far away but with some time and practice maybe rolling through these attacks might work best for you i'll just show you where this boss is located on the map so she is just here let's take a look at the equipment and gear that we're using for this fight so we have a cold simmeter and we have a bloody symmeter the cold scimitar has the ashes of war called horford stomp which we do use quite a lot in this fight you can get a hole for a stump from here you'll have to kill at one of those invisible scarabs to get it this cold scimitar will cause a buildup of frostbite which will allow us to do some extra damage and the bloody scimitar will cause a build up of blood loss which will also allow us to do some extra damage we're using the golden beast crest shield which has the barricade shield ashes of war applied to it and barricade shield greatly increases our block ability we have the crucible knights armor set with the talismans we've got the dragon crest great shield talisman which enormously boosts our physical damage negation this comes in insanely useful you can pick up the dragon crest great shield talisman quite close to the drainage channel sight of grace you'll have to exit out of the room near the site of grace and then follow a path along some branches until you'll find a hole in a roof drop down the hole in the roof and you'll find the talisman at the back in the chest we've got the wing sword insignia which raises our attack power if we keep getting our attacks in quite quickly green turtle talisman which raises stamina recovery speed and we're also using the bull goats talisman which raises our poise the only reason i use that one is sometimes if we are attacking melania and melania is attacking us at the same time and we both strike each other it stops us from getting knocked back and it stops us from staggering so we can continue to get in our attack i just find that that helps the fight flow a little bit smoother and you can get the bull goat talisman from a cave in kailid you'll find it located on a map just here if you do have it you could also choose to use the lord of blood's talisman which raises your attack power by 20 for 20 seconds when blood loss happens in the area we've got 12 of the red flasks and two of the blue in the flask of wondrous physic we've got the crimson burst crystal tier which steadily restores our hp and the green burst crystal tier which temporarily boosts stamina recovery speed we've got exalted flesh which temporarily boosts our physical attack pickled turtle neck which temporarily boosts our stamina recovery speed preserving boluses which takes away the scarlet rot build up and cures scarlet rot if you are afflicted with it and we may also use some freezing pots from time to time there's loads more video game tutorials bus guides and walkthroughs on my channel some

Transcript Text:
is this happening to you then you're in the right place for video game 
training my name is Azzavhar or Azza now let's get   into the video in this video i'm going to show you 
how to defeat the godskin duo using sorcery magic   alright so let's jump into the action first of 
all i want to whip out the old sleep pots so   lock on and throw that bad boy you can roll left 
or right to avoid those black flame attacks so   that's the first one asleep ideally we want them 
to be asleep quite close to each other if possible   so we're going to try and lower this one 
relatively close-ish to the other one   we're pulling back here a little bit keep on 
throwing the sleep parts this one's quite good   at dodging the sleep parts to be totally fair and 
then what we'll do is kind of line them up lock on   to the one at the back then 
want to use terra magicka   then the flask switch to comet Azur hold it 
down keep on holding down RB even after the boss   has died you can keep on holding it down 
and it seems to have a bit of a weird   lingering hitbox type thing and if you line them 
up like that that pretty much deletes the boss   and then you just gotta wait around 
for a little bit for the other one to   pop out and then just finish 
them off with a few bits and bobs   and that's the fight don't forget that there is a 
secret site of grace for this boss fight as well   which eliminates the run back to the boss arena so 
to get there you would just kind of jump off here   onto these stairs and then roll off follow this 
pathway through until eventually you will find   the secret site of grace and once you have made 
your way to the secret site of grace all you're   going to do is run up these stairs and if 
you look to your right you will also get an   NPC summon to help you out in the fight as well 
this is the equipment that we use for the fight   we had a lusat's glintstone staff plus 10. 
this is the armor that we used this is what   we had in the flask of wondrous physick 
and these are the talismans that we used   there's loads more video game tutorials boss 
guides and walkthroughs on my channel some videos   have just popped up right now feel free to check 
them out and give them a click I've covered loads   of games such as elden ring sekiro bloodborne

Title: How to Beat All of Elden Beast's Attacks
Video ID: 4-3-0HDVets
Transcript Text:
all of the Eldon Beast attacks and how to avoid them or counter them let's go okay so first up we got the hand slam attack basically just don't be underneath the hand as it slams down into the floor make sure to roll or move out of the way you can kind of see some stars on his hand a little bit as he raises it up so just be on the lookout for that and move out of the way next up we've got golden breath with this attack the Eldon Beast will spew out a golden fire towards you you can either just stand behind the Elden Beast if you can get behind to avoid it or if you're in front of the Elden Beast just lock on and then hold down left or hold down right and you should avoid the attack there's a bunch of General sword swing attacks there's not too much that I could say about these apart from just roll through them most of the time I usually roll towards the attack to avoid it there is one combo that it does with a sword attacks are a little bit delayed so on that delayed attack you kind of have to delay your roll about half a second and then roll and you should avoid it after a lot of Sword attacks and sword combos most of the time the eldenbeast will kind of be idle for about one two or three seconds so make sure to be using that time to put in some damage or to use any items that you may need to use he also does a swimming sword swing where he kind of swims away for a second and then turns around and swipes the sword so just be on the lookout for it and roll through with the black hole teleport you'll kind of see a cloud of stars start to appear and you can kind of hear the audio of the attack building up as well so just keep your eyes and ears peeled for that and then just run out of the way of the explosion next we've got the nebula attack with this one he kind of swipes his hand in an arc motion just be on the lookout for the stars and the cloud of magic and be out of the way and not in the explosion he can also do the nebula attack in a straight line towards you so just run to your left or your right to avoid it there's also a grab attack called Divine punishment the Eldon BEAST's left hand will start to Glow a golden color and then the beast's hands will sweep forward in an attempt to grab you what I tend to do is roll into the grab and it usually avoids it make sure to get in some attacks after rolling through next we got the ringed explosion the Eldon Beast will kind of float up into the sky and the symbol of the Elden ring will appear up in the air with this one you have to run outside of the Ring area that forms to avoid the explosion and you will have to also jump over the rings that kind of close in on you in the early stages of the fight there'll just be one ring that you have to jump over but in the later stages there'll be three rings that you have to jump over up next we've got the Eldon Stars attack with this attack that eldenbees will send out a golden projectile that will just continuously follow you around and if it does get close to you it will kind of like chip away at your health it doesn't tend to do massive damage but it is really annoying basically just run away from the golden glowing star and sometimes rolling through it and then running in the opposite direction to where it was going can be quite useful this one is the flying flame sword the Elder Beast will fly up into the air for a little bit and his sword will catch on fire as the attack is coming down towards you just roll through it and you should avoid it the attack does come down quite quick so just watch out for it there's also a dive attack where the eldenbees will kind of dive underneath the ground forward slash water and then either appear a short distance away from you or sometimes a long distance away from you not too much more to say on that one apart from just keep your eyes peeled as to where the eldenbeast has reappeared golden wing Spears attack with this one you kind of want to keep a lookout for where the attack was cast from and then make sure to sprint in a straight line in a kind of left ish or right-ish motion away from where the attack was cast you'll kind of get a feel for this one it sometimes takes a little bit of practice to get it right but basically as long as you keep on sprinting and those golden Spears are hitting the ground behind you then you should be fine and there's also a flying variant of this one which is basically the same attack but it just happens really fast and has less of a cast time so just look out for it and do the same tactic as before the Autumn Beast also does a three hit combo in a sword swing smash attack your swing is sword twice and then grab your sword and smash it into the floor once again just roll through the attacks if you roll forward towards the Elden beast on that third smash attack then you get quite a lot of uptime to put in some damage there's also a flaming sword combo this one is quite fast and intense his sword will set on fire and he just keeps on smashing away for a good few seconds I tend to just roll a lot and sometimes roll forward and left to avoid most of the attacks but by Rolling forward and left I sometimes get clipped with the attack attack where he jams the sword into the floor so I found that by Rolling backwards and away from him I managed to avoid all of the sword swings you kind of have to spam roll at first and then delay Your Role slightly after he's done a few strikes in the combo up next we've got wave of gold now I'm not gonna lie to you I've never been able to avoid this attack completely but the attack itself seems to do multiple chunks of damage so if you don't roll you tend to get hit like two or three times in a row however if you do roll you'll tend to get a hit only once so the best that I've ever really been able to do with this one is just roll and get hit once and getting hit once is better than getting hit three times I'd also recommend trying to keep your health top top during this fight because if he whips this attack out you don't want to be at low Health he also does a spinning sword attack where he kind of winds up the sword and does a 360 spin just be on the lookout for the sword coming back around and roll to avoid it there's also a flaming sword stab where he kind of sets the sword on fire and then jams it into the floor just make sure to run away or keep on rolling away to avoid the explosion next we'll take a look at the Flying sword crescents this one kind of gives me a throwback to sakira's Divine Dragon boss fight essentially with this you just want to roll through the Crescent attacks as they come towards you the Golden Crescent itself does project towards you quite fast the timing of your roll can vary a little bit depending on your distance between you and the Eldon beast but like I mentioned the Crescent does come towards you quite fast so most of the time if you're further away you'll want to be rolling forwards about half a second after you see the sword swipe or if you're closer to the Eldon beast when this is happening you'll want to be rolling instantly and just keep an eye out for the Last Sword swing in that combo because he kind of baits his hand a little bit and delays the sword swing so just make sure to keep that in mind and delay Your Role a little bit on that last one it is worth mentioning that I do have boss guides for the vast majority of bosses on Eldon ring feel free to check them out on this channel rise now you're tarnished you're dead who yet live [Music] call of long-lost Grace speaks

is this happening to you then you're in the right place for video game training in this video we're going to take a look at how to defeat Divine Beast dancing lion on Elden ring shadow of the earth tree okay so let's jump into the fight what I'll do is show you the fight first and then afterwards I'll show you the gear that we used and my character stats we'll be doing this solo using no summons first of all what we'll do is use best Your vitality and flame grant me strength bestial Vitality gives us HP regen and Flame grant me strength raises the damage that we do with physical and fire-based attacks we also use seacu which increases our physical attack even more so we jump into the fight and we're going to use the Serpent's bow and serpent arrows to apply poison it'll take a few shots to apply the poison then you'll see his health is ticking on down and he'll also have a green aura on his body this poison effect will last for the majority of this fight then we're going to switch over to rivers of blood and hold it with two hands for the most part with this fight you just want to be keeping an eye on his body movements and his head movements because with most of his attacks you'll see him getting ready to do the attack first before the attack actually happens the movement to look out for is him kind of pulling back and readying up you'll see him kind of pull back a little bit before he starts an attack and what we want to do is avoid his attacks first and then put in our attack at the end of his attack most of his standard attacks are a one two or three hit combo so we want to be waiting for the end of his attacks and then putting in our attacks this is the point where he has a bit of downtime allowing us to take an action this is your time to put in your attacks or if your health or magic is really low this is your time to use one of those flasks what I'll tend to do is roll through one of his attacks hit him in the back a few times then most of the time what he does is a 180 Spin and turns himself around to face you what you can do with the corpse pilot skill with rivers of blood is put in a few attacks into his back or his side then after he's changed his direction to turn and face you you can keep using the skill and you can sometimes land a few strikes in into his face as well just be careful because sometimes he can also follow up with another attack or two so make sure to keep your eyes peeled for this he's got quite a nasty grab attack so you want to be looking out for that you'll see when he's about to do the grab attack because he kind of stands up and then Chomps his Jaws a few times this is your sign to get ready to roll what I tend to do is roll through it and then angle myself ready to punish him in the back he's also got a bit of a crazy four hit combo you'll know when he's about to do this one because it kind of makes a charging up sound that sounds like this so listen out for that audio queue when you hear that sound he's going to do three physical attacks then he's going to stand up and he's going to do one spin of his spinning Elemental Whirlwind attack with the spinning Whirlwind attack you can either back up really far and get some distance getting enough distance will keep you safe from the attack if your health or magic is really low you can use this time to use a flask you can also jump over the element then get close to him and punish him with an attack if you do jump over the element and get close this is a really good time to put some damage in another note with the spinning Elemental work Whirlwind attack he can sometimes just do this attack by itself you'll know when he's about to do this because he stands up really straight on his back legs once again you can just back up really far and get a safe distance or you can stay close and jump over the element three times if you do jump over all three of the spins you then get a decent amount of time to put in a lot of damage so choose whatever fits the situation best if he does the spinning Elemental Whirlwind whilst you're close to a wall I'd recommend running away as far as you can in the opposite direction because if you're close to a wall whilst he does this attack the chances of you jumping over the element are very very slim he changes into phase two around 75% Health remaining you'll know when he's about to do this because he kind of backs up a little bit and then goes up into the air this will change his element from wind to lightning whilst he's doing this phase transition this is a really good time to use any flasks or Buffs that you want to use when you get him down to about 40% Health remaining is going to change his phase again this time he's going to change his element to ice for the most part his attack patterns and combos generally stay the same all the way through the fight it's just that depending on the element that he currently has applied he'll get access to one or two attacks that are unique to that element for example in his lightning phase he can throw lightning bolts at you which will hit the floor first and then they'll explode on the floor so you'll have to dodge the initial lightning bolt throw and then Dodge the burst of lightning that happens afterwards in his wind phase he gets access to a giant tornado with this one you just want to run and roll out the way locking on and running directly to your right or left left and then rolling usually helps you avoid it and in the ice phase he gets access to a foot stomp with this one you just want to be out of the way of his foot and then jump over the ice on the floor the ice tends to split into multiple Lanes with little safe zones either side of the lanes so try and get yourself into those safe zones if possible there is an attack where he spews out an element for a few seconds directly towards you the best thing to do with this one is just lock on and run directly to your right or left and you should avoid it also when his health gets really low he can just change his element to any of the three whenever he wants if your health is half or less than half always make sure to drink a Red flask you want to be keeping an eye on your health and having that topped up as much as possible after you land the final strike you can also switch over to the golden Scarab Talisman which as long as you're quick enough doing this will get you an extra 20% runes and this boss drops a huge amount of runes so getting an extra 20% is massively useful this is the gear equipment and talismans that we used in this fight whilst we take a look at this I just want want to say it's massively important to be collecting the scad tree fragments you then want to be using the scad tree fragments at a sight of Grace to increase your scadu tree blessing level by increasing your blessing level it increases the damage that you deal and it decreases the damage that you take if you're using Spirit Ash summons you also want to be leveling up your revered Spirit Ash blessing as well as once again that will make your spirit ashes deal more damage and take less damage so if you're massively stuck on a boss fight I'd recommend leaving the boss fight for a while and then going to to find some scadu tree fragments then come back to the boss fight after you've leveled up your blessing levels a bit these blessing levels only apply to your character in the DLC some more videos from me have just popped up on the screen if you enjoyed this video then it's likely you'll enjoy one of those as well other

is this happening to you KO then you're in the right place for video game training in this video we're going to take a look at how to defeat Rana on Elden ring shadow of the earth tree okay so let's jump into the fight what I'll do is show you the fight first and then afterwards I'll show you the gear that we used and my character stats we'll be doing this solo using no summons first of all what we'll do is use besal vitality and Flame grant me strength best steal Vitality will give us HP regen and Flame grant me strength will increase our physical attack then what we'll do is switch over to the serpent bow and serpent arrows we want to get two or three shots into her with these arrows this will apply the poison effect and you'll see her health is ticking on down and she's got a green aura on her body next what we want to do is apply Scarlet rot so for this we're going to use rotten breath sometimes applying Scarlet rot can be a bit tricky depending on what happens you might need to use rotten breath anywhere between 1 and 4 times ideally if it goes really smoothly you can just get it in one rotten breath but as we know this is a Souls game and not everything goes so smoothly the most consistent way that I've got the Scarlet rot to apply is to run back a bit and create a decent amount of space between you and Rana and on top of that if you can also get her against a wall or into a corner that tends to help as well the reason for that is because when you use rotten breath sometimes she tries to jump to the right or the left to avoid it but if you've got her close to a wall then she jumps into the wall instead then the majority of the rotten breath will get her even though sometimes this can be quite tricky to apply you'll see why it's massively massively useful in phase two it's also worth tanking a few hits just to apply it just make sure to keep your health topped up so you can tank a few hits you'll know when the Scarlet rot has applied because you'll see a red Aura on her body so now we have poison and Scarlet rot both ticking her health down at the same time and if you keep an eye on her health bar you'll see how fast it's actually ticking down which is really fast in terms of getting your attacks in there's not really a massive amount of openings for you to actually attack although I have found a handful of consistent opportunities so one of those is kind of like where she has the two swords crossed over each other and then she lunges toward you and attacks You by crossing the swords after that one there's usually an opening for about a second or two so use that chance to take an action another really good chance to strike is after the giant magic great sword double attack for the first attack in this combo you just want to roll to your right or left and then the second attack you want to run towards her and then roll forwards by doing that you should end up really close to Rana at that point you've got a chance to take an action another good opening to look out for is after she fires the magical swords towards you she'll then do a jumping lunge towards you as well then she'll do like an uppercut attack there's always about one or two seconds for us to take an action here it's the magical sword attack where the swords are lower to the ground that triggers the lunging forward uppercut attack it's not the magical swords that are higher above her head although sometimes she can actually cast the upper swords and the lower swords together at the same time it's also worth mentioning that she might not do the lunging uppercut if there's too much distance between you and her another attack to look out for which will give us an opening after it's done is the one where she holds one sword above her head for a second and then swings it round in a semicircle motion you've got another chance to take an action here there's also an attack where she holds both swords next to each other and then slices diagonally then slices diagonally again there's a bit of a delay in both of these attacks so don't roll too soon delay your roll a little bit after she does the second attack in this combo that's another chance for you to taken action so keep your eyes peeled for this I think if memory serves this attack here is very similar to an attack that lady Maria does in bloodborne which I thought was quite cool and I also recommend playing bloodborne if you get the chance I also just want to mention that she's got a long range heal punish which is like a magic sword slash just be aware of that if you're going to heal at a distance when her health gets down to about 50% remaining she'll change into phase two and in this phase one of her swords will be imbued with fire and the other will be imbued with magic while she is changing her phase you actually have the chance to put in quite a lot of damage so ideally you kind of want to be prepared for the phase change try to make sure that your health is topped up and your magic is topped up before you drop it down to 50% health because that way you're then ready and waiting for the phase change and you can take that chance to put in a massive amount of damage after she imbus her swords with magic a lot of the time but not all of the time she tends to go into to one of two attacks if you're really close to her she'll go into a fire attack and this can do a lot of damage so ideally back away from her so she doesn't do the fire attack and sometimes usually if you're further away she'll fire a bunch of magical sword slashers towards you usually I find that rolling diagonally left and backwards or diagonally right and backwards multiple times tends to avoid all of the magical sword slashes however on the last magical sword slash I would roll towards your left right or forward in instead after you get into phase two there's kind of two different ways that you can approach this phase one option is run away literally just keep running away around the arena this tactic is dependent on how much time it's taking you to get into phase two because if you still have the poison and the Scarlet rot applied or even if it's just one of those you can actually just keep running away and the poison and the Scarlet rot will just take care of the rest of the fight for us so it's just a case of surviving the attacks this is why it's worth applying the poison and the Scarlet rot earlier in the fight so that's option one and option two is just a repeat of phase one which is just looking out for those opportunities to attack the only thing is in phase two which is a bit more wild and your opportunities to attack are very very slim one more attack to look out for when you get her health really low is her twin Moon's combo attack and this attack is an absolute Beast so you got to keep your eyes peeled for it first of all she'll float up into the air she'll drop Two Moons into the floor then she'll also plunge herself into the floor these attacks will create massive shock wave waves as they hit the floor so you have to jump over all three of these shock waves ideally if you can jump towards her and place yourself close to her after the third shock wave this will give you a decent chunk of time to put in your damage after you land the final strike you can also switch over to the golden Scarab Talisman which as long as you're quick enough doing this will get you an extra 20% runes and this boss drops a huge amount of runes so getting an extra 20% is massively useful this is the gear equipment and talismans that we used in this fight whilst we take a look at this I just want to say it's massively important to be collecting the scad tree fragments you then want to be using the scad tree fragments at a sight of

is this happening to you then you're in the right place for video game training in this video we're going to take a look at how to defeat mesma on Elden ring shadow of the earth tree okay so let's jump into the fight what I'll do is show you the fight first and then afterwards I'll show you the gear that we used and my character stats we'll be doing this solo using no summons first what we'll do is use bestial vitality and Flame grab me strength bestial Vitality will give us HP regen and Flame gry strength will increase our physical attack we also use sepu to increase our physical attack some more we head on through the fog gate and we get a couple of shots in with the serpent bow and serpent arrows he starts the fight off with a leaping Fireball you'll see this Attack start up as he floats up into the air and conjures up the fireball just in front of him for this one as you see him coming down towards you you just want to roll through the initial fire ball slam and then wait about half a second and roll again don't instantly roll otherwise the giant explosion will capture after that explosion you can sometimes get a few more shots in with the poison arrows so at this point poison is applied and his health will be ticking down in phase one next we need to look for opportunities for us to put an attack in and at first it might not seem like there's many opportunities but there are a few so let's go over those openings to attack now the first opportunity to put in an attack is after his leaping Fireball explosion if you wanted to you could roll close to him and then punish him after the explosion happens I tend to use this chance to put in a Serpent's Arrow attack at the start of the fight but you could use it for a physical attack if you want to another chance that we get to takeen action is when he jumps up into the air and then thrusts his spear into the floor at the end of a combo if you roll through that final spear plunge into the floor and place yourself close to mesma you can take an action there one of the best times to put in some damage is after the mesas Fury combo this attack looks a bit crazy but if we analyze it it's not too bad there's four steps to this attack first of all he'll jump up in the air and then spin attack towards you try to roll through this initial attack the best that you can do I tend to find that if he's in front of me and then I roll forwards most of the time it rolls through this initial attack then he kind of makes his way behind you and does a multipar Thrust once again with this one just roll forwards through it and it should avoid the attack then there's a slight delay as he kind of hovers up in the air for a second then he thrusts his spear down into the floor roll through this as it connects with the floor then there's a slight delay again the delay timing on this is very similar to the timing of the leaping fire explosion that he starts to fight with this last attack in the combo will shoot fire up from the floor and Spears will also thrust up from the floor what you want to do is roll forwards through this and place yourself next to mesma if you can place yourself close to him at this point you get about two or 3 seconds of up time so this is a really good chance to put in some damage it's also worth mentioning that for a lot of his attacks I actually choose to roll forwards through them I kind of roll forwards and a little bit leftish not always directly forwards and most of the the time by Rolling this way it generally keeps me safe from a lot of his attacks this is because if you roll backwards some of his attacks are roll catch moves especially the fire ones if you roll backwards for the fire attacks I tend to find that a lot of those will still get me so that's why I roll forwards and leftish there's another chance for us to take an action after a two-hit combo this two-hit combo consists of a 360 spin and then a Thrust forward there's a pretty big delay on both of these attacks especially the second attack where the spear kind of drags along the floor for a little bit before thrusting so make sure to look out for this combo if you can roll forwards and leftish through that thrust you'll get a second or two to put in some damage there he's also got a simple attack where he just jumps up into the air and then throws a spear down into the floor if you can roll through the spear throw and then Place yourself next to mesma you'll get a chance to take an action here he's got another combo which looks very similar to The mesmer's Fury combo at the start but this one actually is a different combo with this one he does a spinning attack towards you so try to roll through this initial attack the best that you can do then he jumps up into the air and then he thrusts the spear into the floor roll through that spear thrust and place yourself next to mesma to get another chance to put an attack in you can tell the difference between the mesus fury combo and this other combo by the starting attack the difference being is on mesma Fury combo he kind of goes upwards into the air first then towards you and then with this other combo he just kind of directly comes towards you straight away he's also got a really nasty grab attack and this attack has quite a large delay before before he actually does the grab so make sure to delay your roll quite a bit when you see this grab coming in you'll know when the grab is coming for you cuz he kind of holds his hand up in the air for a little bit and his hand is also on fire just be careful with this because sometimes he tries to combine his grab attack with his ranged Mesmer flame attack which is where he casts some fire up into the air above him and then it comes down towards you this fire is designed to obscure your view so sometimes you can't really see what mesma is doing behind that flame and sometimes you'll find that he's trying to get a sneaky grab attack in by hiding behind the cover of that flame so just be extra careful when you see the mesmer's flame attack otherwise you could find yourself in the Embrace of mesmer's flame and that is not what you want this fight is a bit of a crazy one because he's got so many different attacks and some of his attacks happen instantly some of them you have to delay your roll a little bit and then others you have to delay your roll a lot as kind of a general rule of thumb I usually delay my rolls a little bit for most of his attacks however you do still need to watch out for the really quick attacks and the massively delayed attacks and to make this fight even more complicated some of the attacks and combos that we've already mentioned can also be combined with other attacks and combos for example sometimes he might Bolt the two hit delayed combo on the end of a normal combo so just make sure to keep on your toes just as a side note here what I'd recommend doing is if your health is half or less than half when you have the chance to take an action I would choose to drink a Red flask as opposed to putting some damage unless you've got him close to half Health remaining and you can push him into phase two then in that case choose to attack or if you can see that he's only got a tiny bit of Health left then push the attack and go for the win but other than that i' choose to heal yourself at half Health he's going to change into phase two and he seems to always open up phase two with an explosive snake attack the snake makes its way up into the air and then comes on down bites the floor and explodes what I do here at the start of phase two is run directly forwards and then wait until I get past that circle on the floor after that I'll drink the flask that I need to drink then I'll drink the flask of wondrous physic as well the crystals that I'm using in the flask will give me infinite FP and massive damage negation for a little while after the explosion you want to whip around real quick and lock onto mesma if you can get up close to him here then you get quite a lot of time to put in some damage for the most part in Phase 2 a lot of his attacks are quite similar to phase one apart from now there's just loads of snakes everywhere he does get access to a new physical attack in this phase and we can take advantage of this one it's the one way he kind of readies up for a little bit and then does a jumping twisting thrust towards you what you can do is roll backwards through the attack and try and place yourself next to mesma at the end of his attack if you can do that then you'll get a chance to attack here in terms of the snake attacks just try and Dodge through them the best that you can do with some of the snake attacks if you can roll through them and avoid the attack then you can actually put some attacks into the snake's face at the end of the snake's combo and there's sometimes a chance to attack when he's transitioning from being the snake back into mesma so make sure to give the snake a Bop on the head if you just see it chilling on the floor for a second if you're not too confident with the timing of the snake attacks sometimes just blocking with a good Shield can tank the hit so it's worth giving a shield a try if the snake attacks are causing you some stress just keep in mind that if a snake comes at you from the sides above or behind then sometimes it might bypass the shield and get you also if you see the purple stuff start to form underneath your feet then get out of the way as there's going to be a snake that pops up and tries to Chomp you he also now gets access to move called Wrath of the serpent where loads of snakes will attack you over and over again just try to roll through these the best that you can do ideally have your health topped up cuz you might take a hit or two and then at the end of all these snakes he'll do the last two attacks from the mesma fury combo which is the one where he plunges the spear into the floor and then the fire and the spears will burst up from the floor just use the same tactics that we mentioned earlier to counter this other than that though in terms of opportunities for you to strike phase two is quite similar to phase one so keep your eyes peeled for all of those opportunities that we mentioned earlier in the video it is also worth mentioning that bleed does a lot of damage to mesma so you'll notice that when we're getting our bleed procs it's doing a large chunk of damage after you land the final strike you can also switch over to the golden Scarab Talisman which as long as you're quick enough doing this will get you an extra 20% runes and this boss drops a huge amount of runes so getting an extra 20% is massively useful this is the gear equipment and talismans that we used in this fight whilst we take a look at this I just want to say it's massively important to be collecting the scad tree fragments you then want to be using the scadu tree fragments at a sight of Grace to increase your scadu tree blessing level by increasing your blessing level it increases the damage that you deal and it decreases the damage that you take if you're using Spirit Ash summons you also want to be leveling up your revered Spirit Ash blessing as well as once again that will make your spirit ashes deal more damage and take less damage so if you're massively stuck on a boss fight I'd recommend leaving the boss fight for a while and then going to find some scad tree fragments then come back to the boss fight after you've leveled up your blessing levels a bit these blessing levels only apply to your character in the DLC some more videos from me have just popped up on the screen if you enjoyed this video then it's likely you'll enjoy one of those as well other than that thank you so much for watching and enjoy the rest of your day

is this happening to you then you're in the right place for video game training in this video we're going to take a look at how to defeat promised consort radan on Elden ring shadow of the earth tree okay so let's jump into the fight what I'll do is show you the fight first and then afterwards I'll show you the gear that we used and my character stats we'll be doing this solo using no summons okay so just going to throw this out there I've been playing from software game since the PlayStation 1 PlayStation 2 days and I can honestly say that this boss is the most difficult boss fight that they have ever created this guy is insane I usually cast bestial vitality and Flame grant me strength just before I enter the arena bestial Vitality will give us HP regen and Flame gry strength will increase our physical attack let's break down those moves and look for those opportunities for us to put an attack in most of the time he's going to start the fight with the gravity Cyclone attack with this one you just want to roll forward into him as he gets relatively close to you this will avoid the attack and then you've got time to take an action here what I'll do early in the fight is apply poison to redon to do that we use the Serpent's bow and serpent arrows but you could also use poison bone darts if you have those this will take just a few arrows and now his health is ticking on down by applying poison to radan it takes a little bit of the pressure away from us so we don't have to worry too much about being hyper aggressive because the poison is helping us eat away at his health and if you do like the poison damage over time time strategy you're going to love the strategy that we do in Phase 2 which really does make Phase 2 a lot easier one of the main things that we're looking to do in this fight is get him stuck in a Parry Loop now I don't normally recommend a Parry strategy for bosses but for this particular boss I feel like the Parry strategy is the best strategy to take this is because when you get him caught in this Parry Loop it forces him to stop using the rest of his attacks for a little while so you don't have to worry as much about all of his other crazy attacks if you look out for the attack where he kind of holds his sword up above his head for a second and then swings it on round down to you there's quite a big wind up for this particular attack and this is the best attack to Parry a lot of the time this attack will happen after he Stomps the floor with his foot and after you get the first Parry he tends to get caught in this Loop over and over again there are some occasions where he can break out of this Loop so just keep your eyes open in case he does break out of it and then he's got another combo which is really easy to Parry as well I usually avoid the first swing in his combo and then he readies up a second swing with both swords side by side this particular attack has got a massive wind up as well so be ready to Parry this attack those two attacks are the main attacks that you want to be parrying all the way through this fight you can Parry other attacks as well but I tend to find that those two are the best just because they have massive wind ups before each of the attacks after we get a Parry I normally run up close and get a light attack in as well after you successfully get three pares his stance will then be broken and now we can hit him with a Critical Strike run up close and press your light attack button to initiate the Critical Strike we're using the Assassin's Crimson dagger Talisman so when we do get a Critical Strike it also restores a little bit of our health don't worry too much if you've not tried parrying before just give it a few tries and give it a little bit of practice and then the timing will start to feel a bit more natural to you also it's worth mentioning that we're using the Booker's weapon skill to Parry and I would highly recommend this Shield if you're going for this strategy if you don't get the Parry at the start of this combo it turns into a four hit combo and then there's like a ground smash area of effect attach at the end so if you do get caught in that combo just watch out for the ground smash at the end of it if you can get behind him you can also punish at the end of that combo what you want to be doing for the vast majority of his attacks is rolling forwards and leftish through them into and towards radan by Rolling in this direction you should avoid the majority of his attacks next we got the blood flame slash there's three slashers in this combo you just want to roll through each of the three slashers but there's a very slight delay between each attack so don't instantly roll three times back to back remember to give it a very slight delay between each roll you could also try and make your way behind radon during this 3/ Blood flame combo you might be able to get an attack in if you can get behind him but just be careful because he tends to follow up the last attack in this combo with another attack from another combo very very quickly the last attack on the blood flame SL combo will produce a little explosion effect and that explosion effect is designed to hide what's coming next because the explosion kind of obscures your view so you can't really see what redan's doing so just be careful because he's probably going to come out of that explosion slashing towards your face next up we've got the star caller cry you can just avoid this attack completely by Rolling at the right time when he shouts just roll and you'll avoid the attack just be careful though if you roll through this and you're also close to him because if you are close he can do the followup to this attack as well if you do get caught in this attack though make sure to run backwards instantly if you sprint backwards instantly then you should avoid the remainder of the attack you also do something quite similar with this attack in Phase 2 the version of this attack in Phase 2 is a little bit more crazy and it's got a few extra attacks in the combo but still if you just Sprint backwards and jump a few times you should avoid most of the attacks let's take a look at the meteor summon move with this attack it's got three hits in the combo the initial hit will be when he puts his swords into the floor so if you are close make sure to roll to avoid that initial strike then the second attack is when he kind of launches himself up into the air so once again roll through that if you're close just after the Ron has shut up off the floor into the air is a really good time for you to take an action so if you need to use a flask or apply a quick buff this is the perfect time to do it right here then the meteors will launch down towards you all you got to do is Sprint directly to your left or right then jump as the meteors get close and you'll avoid the attack this meteor summon attack gets a little bit crazier in phase two but we'll cover that a little bit later he's also got a crossed sword slash for this one you just want to roll forwards through it and then you've got time to put in one light attack he's also got a forward flip attack this one has two hits in the attack as he starts the forward flip his swords will hit the floor directly at his feet so if you are close to him when he starts this make sure to roll to avoid it and then the swords will collide with the floor again at the end of the flip once again just roll forwards into him to avoid this you've usually got time for one quick light attack here as well sometimes you might also do a second flip so just keep your eyes peeled for that once again you've got time to put in one light attack at the end of the second flip he's also got an attack which kind of acts like a grab attack it's got a massive massive delay at the start he'll hold both of his swords up in the air and then really slowly swing them around towards you then he'll do the second part of this attack where he slams his swords into the floor just make sure to delay your rolls quite a bit for both attacks in this combo if you get caught in this first attack it kind of throws your character up into the air roll through both of these attacks and then you get a decent amount of time to take an action just as a bit of a side note here what I would say is if your health is half or less than half and you have time to take an action I would always choose to drink a Red flask over putting in some damage the next attack is what I like to call the undodgeable combo there's three attacks in this combo he slices with one sword and then slices with the second sword and then does like a cross slash and slashes with both swords I genuinely don't know how to avoid the second attack in this combo I can always avoid the first and the third but I can never avoid with the second attack so if you do have any tips or knowledge on that then feel free to drop it in the comments I imagine there might be some kind of weapon skill that helps you evade that second attack anyway just roll through these attacks the best that you can do and then if you can place yourself towards radon after that third strike you then get time to take an action he goes into phase two at about 70% Health remaining as you enter phase two you do have time to drink a quick flask so take advantage of that a lot of the time he opens up this phase with the light of Micha attack where he kind of like floats up into the air and then does a massive area of effect holy explosion to avoid this explosion you need to instantly run in One Direction and don't stop running however what I tend to do at the start of phase 2 to make this phase way easier is kind of assume that he's going to do the light of Micha attack and then start throwing Hefty Rock pots at him if you can hit him with two Hefty Rock pots in quick succession it will apply Scarlet rot to him and Scarlet rot does an insane amount of damage to him to give you an example if you did inflict Scarlet rot it would actually take his health down from about 70% to about 25% even if you don't get chance to put in many attacks the Scarlet rot will eat his health down to about 25% remaining which means that we don't have to stress as much about putting in our attacks this way we're only responsible for taking care of a small amount of his health in phase two which makes it way way easier I would say that it's worth tanking the damage from the light of Micha explosion just to make sure that you land two Hefty Rock pots onto him just make sure that your health is topped up if that's the tactic that you're going to do and like I mentioned earlier you do get the chance to drink a flask at the very start of phase 2 so use that chance to drink a Red flask if your health is low moving on let's take a look at his attacks in phase two a lot of his attacks and his combos are very very similar to phase one so we still want to be looking out for those opportunities to strike at the end of his Combos and we also want to be looking out for that Parry opportunity from before you just got to keep in mind that in phase two after he does an attack with his sword there's also going to be holy bolts Blas in the floor as well but very similar to phase one if you just roll forwards and leftish through his attacks you should avoid the sword swing and avoid the holy bolts as well so keep on rolling forwards and leftish through most of his attacks if you can get him caught in that paral loop again it kind of stops him from using the rest of his attacks for a little while so it makes life easier just by getting him caught in this Loop make sure to keep your eyes peeled for the those Parable attacks that we mentioned earlier and try your very best to get the pares in he's got access to a new combo in this phase with this one he does two sword swings then there's a slight delay then he does another two sword swings then he jumps up into the air then slams down into the floor holy bolts will shoot outwards from where this last attack happened for this one you just want to roll twice through each of the initial sword swings then you want to delay your next roll slightly roll twice again through the next two sword swings roll again through the attack where he jumps upward then roll into him for the final attack in this combo by rolling into him it'll help you avoid the holy bolts that spread outwards he's also got access to an attack where he does multiple blink slashes forwards in a straight line for this one if you just stand directly next to radon almost like on top of him at the point where he starts the attack the entire attack will just completely miss you could also use this chance to take an action he's also now got the ability to use a quick blink 2/ combo attack a lot of the time he uses this one to close the distance between you and him for this one you just want to roll forwards and leish through each of the blink attacks rolling in this direction should help you avoid both blink attacks you sometimes have time to put in a light attack just after this as well he can now do an arena wide holy explosion when you see him cross his arms across his chest and charge up his swords get ready to roll through this Arena wide explosion he can now also use a proper grab attack if you do get grabbed by this twice then it will instantly kill your character just roll forwards through this grab towards radon and then you've got time to take an action here if you get grabbed once you'll have like a little marker over your head if you have micha's great Rune you can use it here to take away this marker by doing that it erases the effect of the first grab you can get micha's great Rune by defeating the scad tree Avatar boss moving forwards we'll take a look at the holy discus attack this one's quite straightforward he just shoots a holy discus towards you and you just want to roll forwards through it as it it gets close to you to avoid it one of the toughest attacks that he's got in phase two is his five blink overhead sword attack he seems to always do this one after his meteor summon attack but there is also a version of this attack that he does without doing the meteor attack first and this alternate version has four sword strikes in the combo so for the meteor summon attack in phase two for the first part of this attack you just want to do it the same as phase one where you run directly to your right or left and then jump as the meteors get close to you after that you want to run backwards and rsh or backwards and leftish because he's about to do the five blink overhead sword attack so for this attack he slams The Floor five times with his sword for the first four attacks in this five blink overhead sword combo I try to run backwards and leftish or backwards and rsh sometimes spam rolling to the sides can also help you avoid this then for the fifth attack in the combo I usually try to roll forwards and rightish or forwards and leftish then after the fifth sword slam there's a very slight delay then holy bolts shoot out forwards in a straight line in front of radon in the direction that radon is facing so you want to pull to the sides or roll to the sides to make sure that you're not directly in front of radon at this point so you can avoid the holy bolts that shoot forward in this straight line then there's a slight delay again and as radon pulls his swords up from the ground holy bolts will blast out from where radon is is in all directions so you need to roll forwards through this attack which will allow you to avoid the holy bolts and place yourself close to radon at this point you've got quite a bit of up time to take an action or two it's really tough to avoid every single strike in this combo so what I would advise is as the meteor summon attack starts up you always have a small window of time to drink a Red flask so if your health is low always take this chance to drink a Red flask because it's quite likely that you might get hit with at least one hit in this massive combo keep your eyes peeled for the version of this attack that you can do without doing the metor summon attack first if he does the alternate version that has four sword strikes in the combo then a lot of the time he just tends to go into a normal sword combo straight after it so just be on your toes and look out for this at any point if he does that ground smash attack where he kind of Jabs his swords into the floor he's always going to do that ground break attack where he pulls the swords up and a blast of holy bolts are going to shoot out in a circle motion from where the attack was so always roll forwards through this and it will keep you safe when his health gets a little bit lower he's going to do his signature holy meteor crash attack for this attack you just want to run in the opposite direction to where radan started the attack and just run as far as you possibly can do in the opposite direction depending on how much distance you ran you might also need to roll through the explosion in summary the main points that will help you win this fight are roll forwards and Le is into and towards radon for the vast majority of his attacks this will help you avoid most of his attacks and combos if you can apply damage over time such as poison or Scarlet rot this will take a lot of the pressure away from you having to find time to put in your attacks especially if you can apply Scarlet rot in phase two it will absolutely destroy his health and in combination with this if you can keep him locked in that Parry Loop the Scarlet rot will be eating away at his health whilst you're destroying his Health as well inside the Parry Loop if you can combine these things together it can make phase two so much easier after you land the final strike you can also switch over to the golden Scarab Talisman which as long as you're quick enough doing this will get you an extra 20% runes and this boss drops a huge amount of runes so getting an extra 20% is massively useful this is the gear equipment and talismans that we used in this fight whilst we take a look at this I just want to say it's massively important to be collecting the scatter tree fragments you then want to be using the scad tree fragments at a sight of Grace to increase your scad tree blessing level by increasing your blessing level it increases the damage that you deal and it decreases the damage that you take if you're using Spirit Ash summons you also want to be leveling up your revered Spirit Ash blessing as well as once again that will make your spirit ashes deal more damage and take less damage so if you're massively stuck on a boss fight I'd recommend leaving the boss fight for a while and then go to find some scad tree fragments then come back to the boss fight after you've leveled up your blessing levels a bit these blessing levels only apply to your character in the DLC some more videos from me have just popped up on the screen if you enjoyed this video then it's likely you'll enjoy

is this happening to you then you're in the right place for video game training in this video we're going to take a look at how to defeat the scad tree avatar on Elden ring shadow of the earth tree okay so let's jump into the fight what I'll do is show you the fight first and then afterwards I'll show you the gear that we used and my character stats we'll be doing this solo using no summons okay so we're going to use bestial Vitality to give us HP regen flame grant me strength to increase our physical attack you can also use sepu as well if you want to to increase your physical attack even more we then going to whip over to the Serpent's bow and serpent arrows jump on into the arena start firing off the serpent arrows this boss can be poisoned if you want to apply poison to him is also quite weak to fire so you can use fire arrows as well for some good damage if you want to let's see if we can apply poison to him first of all there's one two and if you attack the head it does significantly more damage than if you attack the base so ideally attack the head if possible poison is applied so we'll switch over to rivers of blood watch out for that really really quick headbut this is kind of a grab attack just roll backwards to avoid that one just G for it again two in a row uh so that's phase one and as you can see we do a lot more damage if we focus on the head as opposed to the base you can use that chance to rebuff so flame grant me strength best Your vitality and watch out for him popping back up back over to rivers of blood might be able to get an attack in there roll forwards through this he does like three sort of charge forward attacks that's one two and three then close the distance we're going to get back up one two and he usually does a third with the thorn so we roll towards the base there attack the base and then get back out again uh watch out for these Thorns if the Thorns pop up like that you just want to run uh backwards out of the way uh for this one you want to run to the sides and then jump be careful of any follow-up attacks you might do as well roll forward through that Focus back on the head one two 3 and then usually a four so we're going to roll in towards the base and then get back out again we also need to use a blue flask when we can do so now is probably a good time to pop one roll forwards attack the head and heal up going to go for the sort of grab attack you can punish that if you get close enough let's see what he's got for us going for the uh sort of rush forward attack sometimes does that two times sometimes three times going for the three going to close the distance once again uh run to the sides and jump ideally don't run into a tree just be careful cuz there's quite a few around here that's phase two once again going to use that chance to heal back up use Buffs and stuff best Your vitality flame grant me strength you could also use your flask of wondrous physic there as well if you want to probably should use a blue flask he probably going to go into yeah if he kind of like looks like that he going to do that massive explosion so just back up you can also punish there if you get up close and personal after that attack kind of goes into a sunflower praise the sun type thing so same kind of tactics once again just watch out for what he's doing that Thorns attack there if you goes backwards a little bit Thorns are going to pop up from the floor like so so you just want to back up and avoid the BS you can use that chance to heal our both if you need to it's going to go for the crazy charge forward attack that's one two and three close the distance if possible let's see what he's got for us that's one two and he usually follows that up with a third so attack the base and kind of back up a little bit it's going to probably Force us out with the Thorns like so yep just's run backwards uh if you can land uh fire pots and stuff they can do some pretty decent damage to him but sometimes it's easier said than done as he's a little bit all over the place with his move sets and stuff one two and three not g for the third that time he going to force us out with the Thorns going for the crazy explosion he sometimes does this three times so one two and then three just be really careful of that you get a really good chance to punish here um after the three explosion so just punish as much as possible there just a few more attacks should finish him off at this point watch out for this Wombo Combo that he's doing right now we going to go for the Bas here he's only got a little bit of Health left so just focus on the base he's got a little bit of Health left to finish him off and that is the fight this is the gear equipment and talismans that we used in this fight whilst we take a look at this I just want to say it's massively important to be collecting the scad tree fragments you then want to be using the scad tree fragments at a sight of Grace to increase your scadu tree blessing level by increasing your blessing level it increases the damage that you deal and it decreases the damage that you take so if you're massively stuck on a boss fight I'd recommend leaving the boss fight for a while and then going to find some scad tree fragments then come back to the boss fight after you've leveled up your blessing levels a bit these blessing levels only apply to your character in the DLC if you've got any hints tips or tricks of your own for this fight then feel free to let us know in the comments some more videos from me of just just popped up

is this happening to you KO then you're in the right place for video game training in this video we're going to take a look at how to defeat Romina saint of the bud on Elden ring shadow of the earth tree okay so let's jump into the fight what I'll do is show you the fight first and then afterwards I'll show you the gear that we used and my character stats we'll be doing this solo using no summons okay so we're going to use a bestial Vitality to give us HP gen and then flame grant me strength to increase our physical attack you can also pop a sepu as well if you want to to increase your physical attack some more then we're going to whip over to rivers of blood and jump on into the arena I'll show you a few different bits and Bobs that we can do in this fight which is quite weak to Fire and you can get bleed procs as well I don't think you can apply poison and I don't think you can apply Scarlet rot to her ideally we want to be at her sides which is sometimes easy said than done because she is quite mobile and all over the place as you can see I'll try and show you where I mean so just between the Scorpion tail and the centipede head roughly towards her sides that's because a lot of her attacks will miss if you're in this particular position like the Scorpion tail attack will sometimes Miss and the attack with her normal weapon will sometimes Miss as well so roughly around here at her sides for this Stinger attack you just want to to roll as you hear the Stinger noise to avoid it I'll show you a few other bits and Bobs you can use the cookery items if you have some of these if you're going for a bleed build these will build up some bleed in the background if you hit her with some of these they'll help you get more bleed procs that is that try and get back to the side whenever possible we'll heal up her phase change is roughly around 50% Health 60% % health so she's quite close to phase change we'll push her into that roll through roll through going to Blue flask up there so let's see that phase change action you want to back up a little bit as she changes just like that look for a place where there's no butterflies around which sometimes is easier said than done as the butterflies are going to explode we used a flask of wondrous physic there I'll show you a few other different tactics and stuff that we can use in this phase I'll show you the shield strategy The Shield will block most of our attacks and most of the damage going to jump in heavy attack and guard counters here I'll show you the stance break strategy so roll through just roll to the sides uh try to run to the sides to avoid those exploding butterflies jumping heavy attack I'll show you the shield in action here there we go just tanks the damage jump jum in heavy attack Shield up got to be careful of your stamina jumping heavy attack Get Out The Way of the pinkish purple stuff look for a clear space which like I say sometimes easier set than done because the butterflies are everywhere try and go for the stance break so jumping heavy jumping heavy guard counters will also work jumping heavy one more should do it but is up in the air so roll through roll through roll through and then run to the sides to try and avoid those butterflies and once again she's loving these uh butterflies today by the looks of things shielded up jumping heavy attack jumping heavy attack because she's been up in the air for a little while The Stance break is further away than what it was there we go we got it so you got to be really close to this front section here to get the Critical Strike otherwise it won't trigger I just wanted to show you that we brought in some preserving boluses as well so if you've got Scarlet rot and it's building up you can use these preserving boluses uh to take away Scarlet rot it takes away the buildup of scarlet rot and it takes away uh Scarlet rot if it is actually Afflicted on your character as well so the preserving boluses are very very useful R when you hear the noise but uh other than that that is the fight this is the gear equipment and talismans that we used in this fight whilst we take a look at this I just want to say it's massively important to be collecting the scad tree fragments you then want to be using the scad tree fragments at a sight of Grace to increase your scadu tree blessing level by increasing your blessing level it increases the damage that you deal and it decreases the damage that you take so if you're massively stuck on a boss fight I'd recommend leaving the boss fight for a while and then going to find some scad tree fragments then come back to the boss fight after you've l up your blessing levels a bit these blessing levels only apply to your character in the DLC if you've got any hints tips or tricks of your own for this fight then feel free to let us know in the comments some more videos from me have just popped up on the screen if you enjoyed this video then it's likely you'll enjoy one of those

Title: Needle Knight Leda & Allies Boss Guide
Video ID: WuR1Tny6ATs
Transcript Text:
is this happening to you then you're in the right place for video game training in this video we're going to take a look at how to defeat needle Knight letter and her allies on Elden ring shadow of the earth tree in the DLC so far I haven't been using any Spirit ashes summons or the mimic tier however for this particular fight I am going to be using the mimic tier and if you've seen this fight before you'll know exactly why I think depending on how many NPCs youve spoken to and what quest lines you've progressed you may have to fight more or less enemies in this battle for me specifically I have to fight four enemies at the same time what I'll do is show you the fight first and then afterwards I'll show you the gear that we used and my character stats okay so first things first we're going to pop out the old mimic and then we're going to buff up we can pop bestial Vitality to give us HP regen flame grant me strength to increase our physical attack you can also pop a sepu to increase your physical attack even more whip over to rivers of blood at first we want to be hyper hyper aggressive so take this guy out as fast as humanly possible we're then going to flask up so red flask then blue flask and flask of wondrous physic and we've got more joining the fight ideally push him against the wall if possible as because if he backs up into the wall then our attacks won't miss keep the pressure on more as much as humanly possible he's going to try and use a flask very very soon you can sometimes take him out before he uses the flask we have got Scarlet rut if that is the case you can pop some of these preserving boluses if you haven't taken out more that fast you still want to be focusing your attacks on more even when the Allies have jumped into the fight like this keep your attention on more until he has gone I'm just going to jump in here to show you the fight from a slightly different angle if you don't take out more quite that fast so the Allies have joined the fight at this point and that's totally okay you just want to be sort of Ling them around the edges of the arena and keeping the pressure on more watch out for these Scarlet Rock pots just jump out the way keep the pressure on he's only got a little bit of Health left and he's got no more healing flasks remaining so we can take out more fairly quickly at this point just look for your chance to strike which would be roughly around here he's got one hit remaining going to go for a blue flask so we can use corpse pilot with rivers of blood go for the final strike on more there we go then we want to switch our Focus over to dry Leaf Dane whilst the mimic tier takes care of needo Knight Lea going to hop back to take one of the fight this next section will be dry Leaf Dane in this bit you'll want to be quite aggressive but don't get too greedy this guy doesn't have a massive amount of poise so you can stagger him a little bit and knock him back and all that good stuff so it's usually quite a good idea to be quite aggressive with this guy as well as you can see we're pushing him back and stuff with our attacks just keep that pressure on you got to be careful of your own health as well of course to don't get too greedy with your attacks let's take out dry Leaf Dane then we can focus on needle Knight Lea so that is that you can pop your consumables as well if you want to um you can pop a sleep pot which kind of puts them to sleep a little bit they have like a little bit of a sleepy animation like that they don't fully go to sleep but just have a little bit of Animation other than that you've just got leather to take care of and that is pretty much the fight she's got quite a bit of poise so be careful because she can be quite aggressive with her attack combos you don't want to get caught in one of those and there we go I'm just going to jump in here to show you a little bit more about needle Knight leather next we can focus on needle Knight leather with leather it's a little bit of a dance backwards and forwards between you and her because she's got so much Poise she can sometimes just tank all of your attacks and continue attacking you whilst you're attacking her so you might need to dance backwards and forwards a little bit between your attacks and her attacks get your attacks in between her combos but be prepared to roll backwards out of the way if she goes into one of her Wombo combos still got mimic tier in the game and there we go that is the fight whatever you've got equipped in the quick item slots down here your mimic will have access to although as far as I know I don't think the mimic gets access to the flask of wondrous physic feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on that one also the mimic tier can't get poisoned by eating raw meat dumplings but it does restore the Mimi's health so if you pop this onto your quick items your mimic can consume this to restore their health without getting the negative effects of the poison this is the gear equipment and talismans that we used in this fight whilst we take a look at this I just want to say it's massively important to be collecting the scad tree fragments you then want to be using the scad tree fragments at a sight of Grace to increase your scad tree blessing level by increasing your blessing level it increases the damage that you deal and it decreases the damage that you take so if you're massively stuck on a boss fight I'd recommend leaving the boss fight for a while and then going to find some scad tree fragments then come back to the boss fight after you've leveled up your blessing levels a bit these blessing levels only apply to your character in the DLC if you've got any hints to tips or tricks of your own for this fight then feel free to

Title: Bayle Boss Guide: Elden Ring SotE
Video ID: nmPVrFL60Ok
Transcript Text:
is this happening to you then you're in the right place for video game training in this video we're going to take a look at how to defeat Bale The Dread on Elden ring shadow of the earth tree okay so let's jump into the fight what I'll do is show you the fight first and then afterwards I'll show you the gear that we used and my character stats we'll be doing this solo using no summons okay so first of all we're going to use besal Vitality to give us HP regen and then flame grant me strength to increase our physical attack then we're going to pop some Starlight shards to give us FP regen whip over to the serpent Bell and serpent arrows because first thing on the agenda is to apply poison to him so we're going to lock on and shoot these poison arrows into his face to apply the poison should just take a few shots and then his body will have like a green glowing Aura on his body and you'll see his health is ticking on down on his health bar so that is that next on the agenda is Scarlet rot so we're going to be switching over to the secondary arrows that we have brought which are the rot arrows we'll also be using some Hefty rot pots to apply it as well this is the arrows are kind of like building up a little bit of scarlet rot in the background for us and we can also throw some Hefty Rock pots I usually lock off for those Hefty Rock pots because if you lock onto his head uh sometimes he can like pull back and stuff and then the Hefty Rock pots just completely Miss so we're going to free aim these that should be enough to apply Scarlet rot to him so at this point he should have a sort of red Aura on his body from the Scarlet rot so that is that we just rebuffed up kind of tank that hit for the rebuff so what we want to do next is Place ourselves roughly around this uh leg stump here we want to be between the tip of the tail and the leg stump you got to watch out for that flush out attack there it's like the fire breath down towards the floor this is the lightning chain so you just want to keep moving and running to avoid all of those lightning bolts I believe you do more damage if you hit the leg stump or the head so ideally you want to be placing your attacks onto the leg stump or the the head I run towards the wall here because the wall can sometimes help us tank some of the projectiles depending on the angle that they come from we're going to rebuff up we're flasking up here uh flame grant me strength all that good stuff this phase can get a little bit wild so if your health is half or less than half always make sure to top up your health at this point uh because there's so many explosions lightning bolts you name it this phase has pretty much got everything under the Sun so you got to be really really careful that's just like charge up explosion I'm going to back up there you can flask up when you get just outside of the explosion it's gone up into the air um this one is also quite wild you want to kind of roll through the best that you can do we used a flask of wondrous physic there which helped us tank uh that attack that's why I kind of use it in phase two in case you pop some crazy stuff like that that's the projectile one again as you can see the wall can sometimes help tank some of that uh depending on the angle of the projectiles the Scarlet rot and the poison has worn off at this point I believe you can rep poison him if you want to but usually I find it easier just to go for the physical attacks at this point usually what I try to do is go for corpse piler on the leg stump to try and place ourselves over this way sometimes easier said than done because uh he kind of blocks you from getting into this area but you ideally want to try get in roughly around here if he lets us in he's not letting us in today uh that's the flush out attack once again if you if you breathes fire towards the floor you want to run backwards to get out the area of the fire it's designed to like force you out from underneath him see where he goes from always gone for that one I usually look at the floor for that it kind of helps me see where the attack is if that makes sense so I lock off then kind of like point my camera towards the floor a little bit so it helps me see the the fire and the Flames doing its thing we got a bleed proc there and the the bleed procs do good damage as well uh we can apply poison like I mentioned a little bit earlier if you want to but but uh usually it's better just to keep on the offensive at this point so buff yourself back up with anything that you've got so flame grab me strength perhaps that's the flush out just run backwards to avoid the flush out fire breath sometimes what a good thing to do is if you're in this position over here towards the tip of the tail and the leg stump because we're fighting locked off you can sometimes like tilt your camera so you can see his head and ideally you want to kind of see what his head is doing cuz that will allow you to see the flush out attack is a little bit all over the place in phase two so it's quite difficult to show you the flush out just going to roll on through back to same position pop in the corpse piler the corpse piler can can like hit the tip of the tail and it can also hit the leg stump uh ideally you want to be aiming for the leg stump if possible as I mentioned it does increased damage on that section of Bale other than that I think that's most of his attacks just make sure to keep your health topped up if your health is is low or half or low just always always always top up your health that's the flush out once again so this is what I mean so if you stay roughly around here and you're popping in your attacks the camera can see both his head and the leg stump which helps you see if he's doing the flush out attack but other than that that is the fight as you can see in Phase 2 there are a lot of explosions and there's not really too much advice that I can give about those apart from try not to be in them which I know is a lot easier said than done but the advice that I can give about these explosions is try to have your health topped up in Phase 2 as much as possible it's better to have your health topped up and then be able to tank an explosion than to not top up your health then get taken out of the fight by the next explosion and then you have to start it all over again you fail just a bit of extra information about some of his attacks let's take a look at the grab attack if you see and hear this that's the grab attack if you're close to him when this is happening you want to be rolling towards the right or the left and you should avoid the grab or if you're further away from him then you want to be rolling backwards to avoid this attack no matter what your position is you also want to be delaying your roll a little bit as you see this attack charging up don't roll instantly otherwise the grab will catch you for this attack where he breathes fire directly forwards in a line and then kind of tracks you you want to lock on and then run or roll directly to your left or right and you should avoid it he also does a chain lightning attack and for this one you just want to keep running moving or rolling until the lightning has stopped if he jumps away from you then he's likely going to follow that up with one of two attacks one is the straight line fire spew attack and the other one is a tail whip so if you see him jump quite far away then just be prepared for one of those attacks also if you haven't applied Scarlet rot to him in Phase One a really good time to apply Scarlet rot is whilst he's transitioning over to phase two you could use this chance to throw some extra Hefty rot pots at him which should apply the Scarlet rot and making sure that Scarlet rot is applied before the phase transition is really important because it just does so much damage to him so that takes a little bit of the pressure away from us from having to attack him all the time this is the gear equipment and talismans that we used in this fight whilst we take a look at this I just want to say it's massively important to be collecting the scad tree fragments you then want to be using the scad tree fragments at a sight of Grace to increase your scadu tree blessing level by increasing your blessing level it increases the damage that you deal and it decreases the damage that you take so if you're massively stuck on a boss fight I'd recommend leaving the boss fight for a while and then going to find some scadu tree fragments then come back to the boss fight after you've leveled up your blessing levels a bit these blessing levels only apply to your character in the DLC if you've got any hints tips or tricks of your own for this fight then feel free to let us know in the comments some more videos from me have just popped up on the screen if you enjoyed this video then it's likely you'll enjoy one of those as well other than

is this happening to you KO then you're in the right place for video game training in this video we're going to take a look at how to defeat the mother of fingers on Elden ring shadow of the earth tree okay so let's jump into the fight what I'll do is show you the fight first and then afterwards I'll show you the gear that we used and my character stats we'll be doing this solo using no summons I'm going to show you two different variants of this boss guide version one is going to be more of a ranged tactic and version two is going to be more of a up close and personal melee tactic all right so first of all we're going to use bestial Vitality to give us HP regen and then flame grant me strength to increase our physical attack we're then going to run this way a little bit whip out the serpent bow and serpent arrows and start firing off some poison arrows from roughly around here sometimes these fingers can tank the laser which wasn't the case for the first Las there but that's all good the first task is to apply poison so poison is applied we can see the green aura on her body and her health is ticking on down from the poison next task is to apply Scarlet rot so we have switched over to the rot arrows we' just hit the Arena's Edge there just going to run right a little bit cuz I want to see show you the different colors on the auras on her body if you take a look now you can see that the aura is red so we've got the poison applied and the Scarlet rot is applied both of those things are ticking her health down so that's good stuff next I'll show you the cookery items what these do is build up bleed and then eventually get a bleed proc so backing up here for this laser just roll diagonally through it and you should be good that's the first bleed proc as you can see the bleed procs do massive massive damage against this boss for this attack here you want to roll as you see the orb glow really really bright and you should avoid the explosion she's going to try and make her way over to us at this point she likes to go into the crazy laser uh attack where there's like two massive lasers spinning around the arena and she doesn't usually do that unless she's quite close so she tries to close the distance at this point she's gone for the spin to win for this particular one if you're quite far away then the attack just completely misses but she tries to do that to get close to you uh we've gone back to the poison arrows here this is the crazy laser that I was talking about we're going to Shield up through that I actually don't know how to avoid the first laser it always always gets me uh no matter what I do so I just go for a shield uh for that one for the rest of the lasers you can stand quite close and they will just miss stand quite close to the center bit there and they should uh miss you can technically just finish off the fight here if you want to with corpse piler and that is that these are the talismans that we use for the range strategy we use the arrow sting Talisman to increase our Arrow damage by 10% and we combine that with the ritual sword Talisman which increases our damage by another 10% the ritual sword Talisman is only effective if your HP is full the rest of the gear that we used I'll show you after I show you the melee strategy next we'll take a look at the up close and personal stance break melee tactic first of all we'll use best steal Vitality for HP regen then flame grant me strength to increase our physical attack we're then going to pop a sepu to increase our physical attack some more then we're going to head on in towards the boss we can still apply poison with the poison arrows it only really takes a few shots to apply it so we might as well just whack in those arrows as we close the distance here and then we're going to be going for guard counters jumping heavy attacks fully charged heavy attacks and stuff like that all of that stuff will break The Stance so guard counter in there Shield up we're going to roll through that one jumping heavy attack Shield up she's ran away so we're going to close the distance although she's kind of dragged us along with her there we got a guard counter in there so the stance is broken we can pop in a Critical Strike and you can always use this chance to heal so you can be a little bit more aggressive with this strategy because you get chance to heal after the Critical Strike she's going to go for a phase change so we're going to run away then we're going to Shield up you can just Shield this explosion if you want to then we're going to get back into the swing of the fight let's see what she's got for us these explosive orbs these can be a little bit tricky so we're just going to get some distance there jumping heavy attack there it's worth mentioning that if you hit her in the stomach it actually does a bit more damage so ideally place your attacks into her stomach if possible this is quite tricky to avoid if it's really close you can sometimes roll through like that uh you can also try Shield him I can never really avoid this first laser so I just tank it with the shield then run towards the center you can fire in some arrows here if you want to while just doing that if you want to reapply the poison you could also use this Chan to rebuff if you want to and the flask of wondrous physic so once that's done you can head on in get back to the uh melee strategy I think she's gone for the Spin to Win I can't really see her so just going to tank that one with the flask of wondrous physic then we're going to go back to the shield strategy and go for the guard counters guard counter again see what else she's got she's gone for the runway so Chase roll diagonally through jump jumping heavy attack she's ran away again she likes Running Away Today by the looks of things jumping heavy attack she's gone for the spin to in once again we'll try and roll it manage to get it uh sometimes it's it's worth just shielding that one I'm going to roll through jumping heavy should be quite close to a stance break yeah there we go and we also got a bleed proc in there as well so that is that that is the fight this is the gear equipment and talismans that we used in this fight whilst we take a look at this I just want to say it's massively important to be collecting the scadu tree fragments you then want to be using the scadu tree fragments at a sight of Grace to increase your scadu tree blessing level by increasing your blessing level it increases the damage that you deal and it decreases the damage that you take so if you're massively stuck on a boss fight I'd recommend leaving the boss fight for a while and then going to find some scadu tree fragments then come back to the boss fight after you've leveled up your blessing levels a bit these blessing levels only apply to your character in the DLC if you've got any hints tips or tricks of your own for this fight then feel free to let us know in the comments some more videos from me have just popped up on the screen if you enjoyed this video then it's likely you'll enjoy one of those as well other than that thank you so much for

Title: Tree Sentinel - Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: FZy6URcdx5Y
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the boss tree sentinel this is really like the first field boss that you're going to come across in the game so you really can't miss them this fight can be done in one of two ways if you want to wait a little while and progress a bit further into the game really not far at all you can get the horse and then come back and basically joust this guy to death however it is completely possible to kill him without the horus which is how i'm going to show you in this video all of his attacks are generally going to have a follow-up it is really important that you pay attention to his hand and not necessarily his weapon because he can delay his attacks almost every single time i do kind of break my own rule of targeting the boss i usually do not recommend targeting big body bosses like this especially when they're so mobile but for some reason it seems to work out pretty well here and so i just recommend going for it you saw there that he does some sort of like body check with the horse this ability is honestly one of the most devastating attacks in the entire fight it's not easily telegraphed there's really no tell for it except when he's about to move into you and rolling through it is very difficult i recommend just holding your shield up it will drain pretty much all of your stamina if you're fighting him before you've even leveled up once and then you want to pay attention to his hand again and then roll to the side when it's time you should be able to recover your stamina as long as you're not mashing circle you should be able to recover your stamina in time and roll out of the way of the next hit so we've gotten down about 30 percent of the way here getting down to about you know 70 65 health and around this time he will go into phase two where he gets some more aerial attacks such as this one where he slams the shield down i will warn you that attack has a monstrous hitbox because of the shock wave and you can't really tell how far it's actually gonna go when it slams so if you're rolling through that attack you want to make sure that you're actually rolling into the horse or the shield itself and not completely through the boss if you roll through the boss the shock wave will hit you in the back and knock you down and take out a ton of hp so you want to make sure that you're rolling into the boss so you don't roll all the way through it that's kind of the trick same thing with that big shield slam try to roll to the side you certainly don't want to land underneath the shield but you just want to land just outside and still give yourself enough room for an attack this ability right here is just sort of like a shield dash the only thing i can recommend to you is when you see him back up don't chase him down just let him do what he's gonna do so you see there i rolled through the shield got hit in the back not good this move here when he's running towards you you want to roll backwards and then you can get a couple hits on him if you roll forward he'll blast right past you and then you gotta run and chase him down which you really don't want to do the rest of the attacks you can primarily just roll through them they're not too difficult you see our roll backwards here get a couple hits on him and then he will ready his shield roll into him to avoid the damage and then when he leaps up there you want to do a very delayed roll this way you don't take any damage from the slam that's kind of it that's the whole fight i do want to mention that you can actually parry this boss however there is no repast ability um so you can't actually go up to the horse and stab it in the face or anything for big bonus damage it's really just like a free stagger almost it is doable it's just not really worth it in the end because of how on point you have to be to parry his hits and of course you can only parry the spear itself you can't parry the body check you can't parry the shield slams or anything like that one other thing that i will mention is that if you are a caster uh he can reflect your spells back at you with his shield so you want to be very careful when using spells against this boss i actually don't even recommend doing it just pull out whatever weapon you started with and go that route very few spells are effective against this boss especially any spells that have a travel time because you can just block them and push them right back at you but that's it that's tree sentinel and you get a weapon as your reward if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for eldon ring please

Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the boss beastman her beastman of farm azula this is the boss of the groveside cave little catacomb area so this boss is really not that hard he's mostly gonna be doing abilities that are meant to like freak you out so that overhead two-hand slam there it actually has a big delay and then he's actually gonna jump and do the ability so he doesn't just come all the way down this gives you an opportunity to roll through him at the right time and he'll be able to get decent damage on him pretty much every single one of his abilities except for that jump move i believe is parriable you don't really have a quick shield if you're using certain starting classes at this point of the game so i wasn't relying too heavily on it but if you're feeling confident you can parry everything and he'll go down pretty quick but once i realized i'm really not having a good time pairing here i started to slow down a bit and just uh take it more slowly when he roars that will basically reset his poise and then he'll do generally either the first move or this one here this is a bigger move you can just roll through the final hit when he's jumping up in the air be able to get decent damage uh pretty quickly so he's gonna swing twice and then if you're at about maybe three or four paces away you can usually trigger that long combo move that uh he does but i just decided to take a little bit more slowly because i didn't want to repeat this area possibly lose souls and uh yeah so i was i went up getting punished for my efforts there i was trying to get greedy in in the end that's basically it he doesn't really have a second phase aside from the roar if you will um but yeah really not too much to worry about when he starts thrashing around just get away from him and roll through the final hit and then just deal some more damage and he'll go down without too much of a fight the treasures of this boss arena are different from the closed network test so just be ready for that you will get a different reward it's your first talisman that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll see johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Erdtree Burial Watchdog (Stormfoot Catacombs) - Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: RNNUDP1axMk
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the boss erd tree burial watchdog this is the boss of the storm foot catacombs if you played the closed network test or watched any of the footage from it you will immediately notice that this boss has a new move where he stands on his hind legs and walks towards you like a terrifying statue other than that it's basically the same exact fight from the network test so if you didn't have too much trouble there probably won't have too much trouble here i will say his ai does seem to be a bit smarter and more active as you can see he turned his head around and then slammed me with a tail it's not necessarily a new move but getting him to do that was kind of hard in the cnt really wouldn't happen that often but it actually happened a couple times when i was fighting him so again when he's on his hind legs you just want to target him and then watch for his hand to start moving towards you you really only have a few frames to react you can just hold your shield up and you should be able to block it i haven't even leveled up by the time i got here still very early on in the game so you know you definitely block all the damage but if you're able to you want to try to roll out of the way this way you can get two or three hits on them in the meantime if you get hit with a fire you will get knocked down it's important that you just try to get up as quickly as possible don't immediately start trying to attack him because chances are he's got a follow-up attack ready for you so if you get knocked down by the fire just roll out try to back up get the safety and that's that this aerial slam move has a huge shock wave similar to the tree sentinel shock wave it can take a little while to get used to but you can roll through it and deal some decent damage and then you'll be able to chip away at his health so yeah you see there it's a really short reaction window on that slam when he's on his hind legs it's also like scary but funny looking because he doesn't really move his face um this move here when he puts a sword on the ground he's gonna do uh sort of like a 540 spin and he can catch you a couple times there so you just want to roll away and back up right here i was able to just get him stuck in a loop walking on his legs i think it had something to do with my positioning when he started i'm just in his blind spot but he can basically pivot on a dime which isn't exactly fair maybe they'll patch that out but if you do notice that he's doing that what i recommend doing is just backing up straight holding your shield up he will slam the sword down and then you should just take some stamina damage you really shouldn't die from it he's gonna spin around gonna get a couple more hits and then he goes down and that's it that's the urgery burial watchdog if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guys for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord links for those are in the description below as always i'll see johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Video ID: iQr-8zy4c6A
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the stone digger troll the stone digger troll has from what i can tell a pretty big change from the network test version in that his attacks do a lot more aoe damage or you know just big shock waves but also and i noticed this throughout the the mine itself enemies with scales you have to two hand your weapon in order to actually deal effective damage to them otherwise your weapon will just bounce off of them so if you're noticing that your weapon or your attacks are just bouncing off the the boss or even the enemies in the mine try two-handing and you should be successful i didn't get to try this with every single weapon class i was primarily just using swords in my playthrough in the beginning so you know i can't speak to every single weapon but it did seem like that was doing the trick for me however that of course does mean that you can't use a shield his attacks are pretty big and lumbering and have long wind-ups so it's not that challenging to roll through them effectively one thing you do have to watch out for though is this attack right here where he slams his hammer into his club into the ground and then pulls it back up sort of like the sanctuary guardians in dark souls one uh from the arturia to the abyss dlc very similar setup you can see here that i had him against a wall you kind of don't want to ever do this so you're gonna or i'm going to let him pull out of the wall a bit and kite him back towards the center the reason for this is because you want to be able to roll through his big shock waves and if he's up against the wall your only recourse is to roll into the wall and chances are you may get hit by the shock wave anyway so try to keep him in the center that's really the trick to this fight that's it for your efforts you are rewarded the roar medallion which increases the damage from roar abilities that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the link for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Demi-Human Chief x2 (Coastal Cave) - Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: _y2-cvI7SSo
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the pair of demi human chiefs in the coastal cave there is a pretty big change to this fight from the network test version if you look in the top corner of the screen top left corner you'll notice the second demi human chief walking around in the network test he was always asleep so what i recommend doing is not actually engaging this boss until the second chief is near the fog wall in the back of the room once that happens you have enough space and if your weapon is upgraded to maybe plus one or plus two you should be able to take him down pretty quickly without alerting the other one i do not recommend fighting the boss anywhere near the pathway to the back of the cave try to keep him in this immediate vicinity near the entrance and you will be able to only fight one at a time you may have to deal with some of the ads that is just sort of like a fact of life what i recommend doing for them is just trying to line them up with the boss and not attacking until you're able to get all of them meaning the ads and the boss in each hit or at least a couple the ads plus the boss the reason for that is because the ads are really weak and you can stagger them in one hit and so you want to prevent them from dealing damage to you and you know the boss you can whack once or twice and he you know he'll get staggered as well but that's just my general strategy so with the first boss down basically the same exact process for the second one you're going to have a couple of ads make sure to pick up the fireflies in the water here but you're going to have a couple of ads and then the boss himself will aggro and it's literally the same process the boss generally will start fighting you by doing a roar this is an opportunity to take out one of those ads and just ignore the boss the boss does not have a lot of health so it's really just about avoiding it until you're able to manage it and then you can go in and deal with it pretty easily careful by about putting your back up against the wall like i just did not recommended and you do not want to roll for that slam attack until the boss is actually on his way down otherwise it is a delayed hit and you will end up getting slammed and that's not good because if there's ads around you there's lots of follow-up damage that's about to come so you want to be very careful i do believe this boss can be parried i think i remember doing it on the network test but i just never tried it here um it's really not worth it it doesn't have much health at all i think my weapon's only up to plus two at this point i'm just shredding him that's it once both demi human chiefs are down you get the tailoring tools and if you've been following box quest line you will also get the sewing needle and all you have to do is just run back to the entrance of the cave and bring it back to him and that'll progress his storyline a little bit further if this is your first time in this cave do not take the teleporter in the back instead walk through the back exit of the cave and you'll be in a new area with a point of grace checkpoint so it's sort of like a trick this teleporter don't take it but that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll switch johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for eldon ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the boss mad pumpkin head this boss was somewhat hidden in the closed network test but the barricade that was blocking him is now removed and much easier to access this mad pumpkin head isn't too difficult uh sort of a field boss of sorts you know certainly a dungeon boss or anything the main thing you have to watch out for is his head he can slam it down and hitting the head has a chance of bonking your weapon off and you really won't do much damage at all if you go for the head so with that bonk you will get staggered and then it just opens you up to all sorts of attacks he does swing the flail with his right hand so you always want to roll towards his right hand in order to get behind it as long as he's not doing some big combo so the main objective is to just try to get behind him get some hits in and that's really it he can punch with his left hand just like that that does a ton of damage and a lot of stagger so you want to be very careful getting hit by the punch is almost going to be certain death it's just kind of the way it goes so you really don't want to let him hit you at all if you have any sort of really powerful magic he can be staggered you can't repost him but you can sort of push him uh you know backwards and then you can get some free damage in that's basically the whole fight he doesn't pose much of a challenge uh what i will tell you is that his treasure has changed from the closed network test so don't be alarmed when you don't get what you think you might get um yeah that's sort of the way it goes with the retail build of the game that's it that is the boss if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll see johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Grave Warden Duelist (Murkwater Catacombs) - Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: HiMJ6Z9U18g
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for eldon ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat grave warden duelist this boss is very aggressive however it is completely humanoid which means that you can parry and backstab this boss i don't necessarily recommend fishing for backstabs all the time because he can spin around really quick his hammers are on chain so he can swing them and hit you from all sorts of angles but if you feel like you're going to be in a good position for a backstab just go for it you can parry most of his moves except for the jumping one and i was never able to successfully parry where he slams the hammer down and drags it backwards i don't know if that's variable but everything else is in terms of what i've seen so uh he's very susceptible to critical so if you can get those backstabs or posts you're going to do really big damage he doesn't stagger very easily so only doing one or two hits and then backing out is really the way to go if you're not gonna fish for backstabs like i am he will buff himself after a little while while this is happening he's just gonna glow red right here you can hit him while he's doing this get a few free hits in while he's buffed he's just gonna become more aggressive and deal a lot more damage i recommend just waiting this phase out and only hitting him when you think it's completely safe like right here this isn't a bad time unfortunately that wasn't a backstab because he was sort of turned around but the buff doesn't last too long maybe 15-20 seconds and then he'll go back down to normal and then the fight resumes as it was that's pretty much it he doesn't have a phase two aside from the buff i guess he just does the same moves and then there's a parry really not that hard it's just that he has a high damage output so he can kill you quickly but the moves themselves once you kind of learn them they're easily telegraphed that's his grab pretty easy to avoid has a really long wind up uh it's not necessarily certain death if he grabs you but it will deal a ton of damage if you do get caught but that's it that's grave ward and duelist ended with a backstab i do want to say this boss's arena and i think his model itself got a gigantic visual upgrade from the closed network test i recommend checking out my footage from that i'll link it in the description just so you could see the the difference in quality here because it was startling to see this guy in this uh in this great quality that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord links for those are in the description below as always i'll see johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Flying Dragon Agheel - Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: EspkND-fgNQ
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for eldon ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat flying dragon agile i do not recommend fighting this boss like i did in the closed network test where i fought it on foot you absolutely want to fight this boss on horseback it is so much easier to do so and i also think it is balanced around horseback because there are some moves that are really difficult to avoid unless you have the speed of the horse alright so you don't really have to clear out the arena at all if you'd like you can take out some mosquitoes they can be a little annoying you know take them out before you fight him properly having a bow handy is useful for that as well but he'll pretty much torch anything in his path uh for you which is nice so all i'm doing is i'm literally just riding around in circles chopping at his feet and then when you notice he's about to like change his stance it may look like he's about to fly away or possibly do a tail swipe that's when you just want to put some distance between you and the boss and let him reset whenever he flies away if he stands still for long enough he will do this attack here what i recommend doing is either attacking his wings or if you feel safe enough you can do a double jump and then hit his face hitting agile's face will deal massive amounts of posture damage or stagger damage and then you can actually repass this boss and get a huge amount of damage it does take a little while but if you take those pot shots at his face eventually it'll build up and then you'll be able to get the riposte so you saw there he did a tail slam whenever he sort of puts his tail up in the air and holds it for a second that's what he's going to do i recommend if you're able to either just face tank the hit it's not going to be a one shot but if you're able to run towards his face and you will avoid that tail slam if you ever feel uncomfortable or you can't get a good angle on a hit feel free to just ride out and then you know just get your bearings again you know this isn't a race unless you completely leave the lake he's not going to reset um at least in my experience he will pretty much follow you throughout the entire lake so yeah you can see there i had a very clean shot on his head so i just went for it and then you get a free riposte you get the gracious gift of tears from sakura and then you just start it back up that's the whole fight doing this on foot like i said is possible it's just very difficult and i don't even think you're supposed to be able to do it not that you're not supposed to be able to do it but the fight is very clearly balanced around fighting him on horseback i mean you get the horse a few yards away pretty much so that's really what you're supposed to do you can continue to go for pot shots on the head you can repost him more than once per fight unfortunately i didn't you know get that but i know for a fact that it is possible to do i do notice that his talons or his wings rather seem to take more posture damage than his feet i have staggered him many times at least in the closed network test by primarily just attacking his wings but here in the full version i only got the the staggers on the head so maybe they balance it out but i just noticed that you know the wings have a higher surface area so they're easier to hit instead of trying to fish for the legs this move here where he's just sort of flying in mid-air for a little while likes pausing in mid-air that means he's going to dive towards you with his talons so just make sure you uh make sure you avoid that for your troubles you'll receive a dragon heart and a message appears that says a new draconic power is available at the cathedral of dragon communion if you have not already discovered where that cathedral is i'll show you now if you don't want to be spoiled just feel free to leave the video on the coast of limb grave right near where you start the game just get down to the beach and you will find a cave called the coastal cave adventure through this cave defeat the boss here and instead of taking the teleporter back to the entrance of the cave walk past the teleporter and you'll be able to leave the cave from a back exit and this will be the island of dragon communion and the cathedral is here so there is a goblet or a chalice or an altar here and then you can trade your dragon hearts for what seem to be pyromancies mostly i'm not sure if this expands as you get through the game but basically pyromancies are miracles and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new

hey everyone johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the knights cavalry in limb grave this boss only appears at night so make sure you rest at a point of grace and then change the time of day to night and the regular hulking warrior on this bridge will get changed to the knights cavalry this is near agile lake so this fight is pretty interesting it's a joust but the boss can do everything you can do meaning he can drag his weapon on the ground he can do jumping attacks he's a little bit more acrobatic and aerodynamic than you are but basically it's just a straight 1v1 with a fair opponent he has this gigantic axe which means he has really good range what i recommend doing is trying to be on the opposite side of the hand that he's using or the opposite side of his weapon while mounted you can press l1 to attack on your left r1 to attack on your right and then l2 and r2 to drag your weapon just like this to get greater damage on each side dragging the weapon however does take a decent amount of stamina and that is something that you gotta learn to manage on the horse during these fights you will notice that when you try to sprint away that uses stamina whenever you swing your sword that uses stamina and you don't get as long of a combo with your weapons as you would on the ground so you really gotta pay attention to your stamina can't stress that enough the boss technically kinda has two hit uh health bars he has a health bar for himself but then his horse also has a hit bar you want to knock him off the horse and basically kill the horse and then it'll be a 1v1 fight on the ground but he can revive the horse so you want to make sure that you stay in his face when he is on the ground this way he doesn't get the opportunity but he do have to be careful for that that's what i mean like he can do everything you can do you can revive your horse he can revive his horse it's all the same so once you have them on the ground you want to quickly dismount and then you can get a huge huge critical attack on him just by going up and pressing r1 and then it should only take a few attacks uh after that he is parriable he is backstabbable but in the end i just sort of went for it that's it that's tonight's cavalry this first one it's a really cool fight and only available at night and for you trouble so you get the ash of war repeating thrust that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll switch on the cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Crucible Knight (Stormhill Evergaol) - Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: aQPkNnYOzc4
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the crucible knight in the storm hill ever jail this is a really difficult fight you can find it quite early in the game but i recommend coming back much later once you are stronger with at least a plus five weapon and a decent stock of flasks starting off you can get a few free hits in on the night because he just sort of has like this startup animation whenever he two hands a sword he will do these big lumbering swings that you really got to watch out for could basically drain your stamina immediately when he pounds the ground holding his sword with two hands he's going to follow up with an attack when he pounds the ground holding his sword with one hand he's just gonna sort of stare at you but that ground pound can do a ton of stagger damage even if you are blocking so you want to roll through it as best you can this boss is parriable however he cannot be backstabbed and if you're attacking him on his left side you're right he will almost always block the attack with his shield even if he's not holding it up hitting his shield basically counts as a block it's pretty crazy so the general strategy here is to not take really any damage for the first 40 of his life because phase two is really really difficult and i know it sounds obvious don't take damage till phase two but you're gonna find out why here in a second when he is readying his shield to do a scoop you want to roll into the shield pretty late uh this way you can stay close to him and get a free pot shot off on him you can see there parried him you can parry him even through phase two it's all doable but it is very very difficult so you see there he pounded the ground holding a short two hands he does an overhead slam this is the shield attack and get a free hit on him basically all of his swings are variable but he has a delay on most of them so it's quite difficult all right so here's phase two he will always always always start off with that flying attack you could just roll right through him if you'd like you can roll backwards and attempt to chase him down to get a free hit however he is a lot faster in this phase and he gets another one of those miracle sort of moves where he has a tail swipe and you'll see it here in a moment there's one but he can also follow that up with an even bigger tail swipe that basically fills almost the entire arena so it just has to be rolled through and unless you have a shield that can block holy damage entirely which i haven't even found yet in this game and i've been i've killed 25 bosses so far but unless you can find a shield that blocks a ton of holy damage your best recourse is to just time your roll and just be invincible through it that's really the best course of action so you can see here i'm taking it much much slower now because his moves just do so much damage and because of that tail swipe you want to be very careful because you really don't have a ton of stamina to play with at this point in the game unless you're doing this super late i wasn't but i did have to come back to him after a while but yeah you don't have much stamina throughout this fight so you gotta manage it very very uh safely and intelligently there's a second tail swipe you can generally always tell when he's about to do it it has a big telegraph but it just fills basically the entire screen and deals a ton of damage so this last 15 of life here is going to take me a few minutes to whittle away i just tried to play it so safe because he only had one flask left i didn't even have a wondrous flask at this point i hadn't found it yet so yeah you can roll backwards through that attack like i said chase him down try to get a hit but in my experience he was primarily following that up with a double tail swipe and i didn't really have the stamina to roll through both or even attempt to block an attack so it's really up to you whatever you want to do yeah you can see one one tail swipe half health it's it's pretty pretty rough so this is gonna be a double tail swipe just roll through the second one you can roll into it and try to get a shot on him after the tail swipe he is uh he does have a few uh recovery frames there so we're gonna attempt to get a parry here what i was noticing is after he flies away see tons of stagger damage when he flies away if you put a lot of distance between you and the boss he will generally do a running attack and if you can sort of like get the parry timing down on that one attack you can keep baiting it out and then just manage the fight through there that is one strategy unfortunately i'm still trying to get used to the parry timing in elden ring so it really wasn't working out for me for defeating the boss you get aspects of the crucible tail which is a miracle that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best

Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat bloodhound knight darwil in the forlorn hound ever jail this boss was in the closed network test however he was moved to a different area of limb grave just to sort of throw you off the trail this boss is not that difficult especially probably by the time you find him you'll be fairly leveled up i have a plus five weapon at this point just a plus five straight sword um he sort of has two phases i would call it 1.5 in the second phase he basically just becomes more aggressive he doesn't get any new abilities i will let you know this boss is parriable i have confirmed that with multiple people however i'm really bad at it when it comes to this boss so i'm not able to demonstrate any of the timings here i apologize for that uh he does stack bleed as you notice the meter will probably pop up every time you get hit bleed an elden ring is very similar to dark souls 1 where once it stacks all the way up you take a huge amount of damage so you want to make sure that if your bleed meter is filling up really high you're probably better off just avoiding the boss for a minute let it drop back down this way you don't actually get hit with the bleed that's one way to manage it so here in phase two he's below 50 health he's just becoming more aggressive he does more of the teleporting moves just moves around a lot faster a little bit less predictable he reminds me a lot of dancer the boreal valley and his movements very silky very smooth but also sort of like watchdogs of pharyn with the delayed hits it's a really cool boss i like him in the network test and i still like him here very cool implementation but if you come to him kind of late he's gonna die really quick just because your weapon is dealing so much damage and that's honestly how i recommend taking care of him his reward is just a weapon so it's not something game changing that you'll need for the rest of the game it's just the bloodhounds fang which is a good weapon but you know it's not like coming here is is a necessary part of the game so if you're having a hard time with him just come back later you should be able to destroy him pretty quick that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll switch on the cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Video ID: r490yGo7_3c
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the roon bear the roon bear is a really interesting boss what makes it very difficult is the space in which you are fighting him the arena is sort of the real boss here you want to make sure that you're trying to keep the boss near the middle of the arena at all times and just away from any walls this is way easier said than done i know but you're going to notice later on in this fight i get pinned up against the wall and i have no idea what's happening i'm just doing my best to get out of the situation as safely as possible so the boss has a lot of follow-up attacks he will very rarely just hit you once if you notice he's moving up on his hind legs then he's probably going to do some sort of like ground pound a couple times and then he will always swing back and forth he will do his best to keep you in front of him he's really really aggressive and does not like that you disturbed his sleep you can just stand under him for those ground pounds it's not too bad this overhead slam is quite devastating even blocking that will deal a ton of damage and as you see there i block the dash and it dropped my stamina 70 percent down to 30. so he does have a grab right there if you mash l1 and r1 i i never know if this translated to the other games but in dark souls 1 if you matched l1 and r1 while being grabbed it significantly reduced the damage so i've always made a habit of doing it maybe that helps maybe it doesn't i actually have never truly tested it but i always do that just as a precaution yeah see even blocking he just deals tons of stamina damage it's incredible so just try your best to get a couple hits at a time you're really never going to have too big of an opportunity to just go nuts on this boss if you have a spirit to summon feel free to do so the boss can be staggered i do know that these things also appear out in the wild kind of rarely and i know that they can be staggered so if you have a spirit go for it and the stagger will deal a ton of damage but he doesn't necessarily have a phase two it's all one phase he doesn't get any more aggressive the lower his health is or anything he does all the same stuff so it's really not too much to worry about but you can see here i'm starting to kind of get pinned against this wall and then i have no clue what's going on i couldn't exactly control it he pushed me into the wall but that's why fighting him in the middle of the arena is really your best bet he doesn't seem to have any stagger weak points like hitting him in the head doesn't seem to do anything special i could be wrong on that but in my experience it's really just a giant bear and you just got to deal with it that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the cemetery shade i will warn you i tried really hard to parry this boss and never was successful so i'm going to be spending a lot of time in this fight just taking damage unnecessarily i was able to get it on the first try but that's why you just see me taking so much damage and trying to bait the boss into attacking me like an idiot it was my own fault i was just trying to see if i could parry it starting off the fight you saw the boss get this green bug on its head and then shoot me with a spider web it's sort of obvious what's gonna happen there if you play demon souls it's the same thing as the jailers it's gonna bind you and then they're gonna run up and try to grab you and the same thing happens here with the cemetery shade so when you see the green thing moving just try to either line yourself up with a pillar or just put some distance between you and the boss so you can easily roll out of the way that's one way to deal with it so i could easily just go in and kill the boss right now i had a plus five weapon at this point and i was level i think like 35 40. um so i was just shredding it but i was really wanted to parry unfortunately it just never came yeah so here's another spiderweb unfortunately i got hit by it but here's what the grab looks like anyway i do match l1 and r1 in all souls games that reduce uh grab damage and dark souls one i should really test it in elden ring to see if it actually makes sense to do or not but generally when i'm getting grabbed i'm terrified so i just mash it but yeah it's really the same fight over and over the boss does not have a second phase doesn't become any more aggressive or anything like a lot of bosses do that move right there will basically shred your shield so if you notice it's sort of winding up for it try to back away or worst case just try to block the whole thing and then uh just back up once it's done yeah see it just stacks bleed like crazy really hard to deal with unfortunately out of flasks at this point so now i just go in and kill the boss because i figured you know what i don't want to do this again a couple more hits and the boss goes down it does have this cool teleport i like that a lot uh it does make it a little difficult to track if you have the lantern be sure to equip it on your belt this way you can keep better track of it for your troubles you will receive lutel the headless which is a very special summon that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll switch on the cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat ancient hero of zemor in the weeping ever jail starting off the fight it's just like all these sort of ever jail fights you can get a free couple shots on the boss as they are sort of starting up so decent damage there this boss is completely parriable can't be backstabbed though uh but i do recommend trying to learn the parrying timing just because in phase two it's really gonna come in handy fair warning though i didn't learn it i'm not that great at pairing in this game so the boss has a lot of frost attacks as you can see if you notice it sort of brings its left hand up to its chest and pauses for a moment it's going to do a quick snap and then just deal frost damage in an aura when it starts breathing ice onto the ground you can actually run to the side and run around in elden ring you can run while targeting which is sort of like a new quality of life mechanic that they added to the game so you can just run around the ice and then get a couple shots on the boss in the back so the boss does have a second phase it happens when she's about 60 it should be in a moment here once phase two happens she will start backing away you can chase her down if you like and get a few shots on her she does get some armor here so you're not gonna deal a ton of damage but it is worth doing because in phase two she becomes quite crazy one thing to note for phase two here is that you do not want to fight the boss near any of the fog wall it's around the arena entirely but she can really trap you if you are not careful so when she does this big cyclone she has a few abilities that she can do immediately after she can either just breathe frost in a in a pattern then just got to avoid that she can crouch and then zoom at you really fast and deal tons of damage it'll basically be this move out of it uh or she can just sort of walk out of it and attack in like a normal fashion yeah so there's the snap there it doesn't really deal a ton of damage to you that snap is really just a big buildup of frost so it's not the end of the world if you get hit by it but just keep a close eye on the frost meter this way you don't get frostbitten frostbite in this game works very similar to dark souls 3 to sort of slow down for a while um and then you know deal some damage but that's about it it's nothing too crazy so we're getting pretty close to the end here you see big cyclone and then she is going to just breathe ice and then all you got to do is avoid that you can't really go into her when that cyclone's around unless you want to just take all the frost damage but it's just worth waiting that's really all i would recommend doing so she's gonna do some big slams starts acting like dancer and then she's gonna do one more snap and then we'll get another couple hits i tried to parry there failed miserably and uh luckily was able to get away and survive and then we'll just go in for the kill here there's frostbite not too much damage just slows you down until it leaves you that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll switch on the cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Miranda the Blighted Bloom (Tombsward Cave) - Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: oI7VU154w9w
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat miranda the blighted bloom this boss is pretty interesting just a very small arena that's the whole gimmick to it the key to this fight though is to bring a torch you should have one of these in your inventory at all times but the torch is basically going to kill this boss for you so what you want to do is put the torch in your left hand and then press l2 a couple times to stab the boss with the torch it will light the boss on fire and pretty much interrupt just about any ability she's going to do with the exception of this one so once you see these stars come out of the ground just back up and wait for it to finish the torch as you saw before can interrupt her poison mist which is really really helpful if you notice that the boss is sort of just sitting straight up but not extending the stalk that means that she is going to slam her head into you and then all you gotta do is just move and then she won't hit you but it's kind of deceptive there because it looks like she's about to put her head up and then extend it to summon the stars but really she's just going to slam onto you and that's really the only physical damage the boss can deal to you pretty easy and now you know how to defeat them when they're out in the world that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll switch on the cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Video ID: UUgjS9-LoMc
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the erd tree watchdog in the weeping peninsula so this variation has a couple things going on as you can see there are four little jade gargoyles here in the arena recommend dealing with them as quickly as possible do not leave them alive i guess optionally you can leave them alive and hope the boss takes care of them but i wasn't waiting for the opportunity for that one of them will generally stay in the distance throwing daggers at you so you want to keep that in mind as you're dealing with the others and just try to time your rolls in your head uh in order to avoid those and then of course do your best to keep an eye on the boss as well so the really the only variation with the this version of the boss is that it has three heads which means it can deal more fire damage however i didn't really feel like that made a difference because the boss tracks you so quickly when breathing fire even with just one head that having three really didn't change the attack that much um but maybe they'll add more to this boss in a future update uh after you kill the ads it's basically the same fight as it was in limb grave so the same strategy applies uh when it's up on its hind legs just try to track it and then once you see it its hand back do your best to roll sometimes you won't be quick enough and luckily your shield will still be up which isn't you know the end of the world but if you jump and attack its head you will get a critical provided you deal enough stagger damage to it it's a nice way to defeat the boss for your trouble you get the demi human ashes spirit summon you

hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the knights cavalry in the weeping peninsula this boss is only available at night so you can rest at the lost sight of grace over there in the distance and change it to night and then this boss will appear this knight's cavalryman has a three-headed flail which can deal insane amounts of damage to you and your horse so you want to keep your distance even more than you did against the one in limb grave if you fought that one i was trying to see maybe i'll fight him on the ground it might be a little bit easier um but you know really whatever strategy you think to employ just try to stick with it the flail builds bleed which is very frustrating um yeah so just keep that in mind if your horse does die you can spend one flask to revive it and keep going otherwise you can probably just reset the lost side of grace and just you know try again won't be the end of the world but the same general strategy applies here for the night's cavalry you want to try to kill the horse so you can knock him off and then get a big critical but keep in mind he can revive his own horse just like you can so you want to try to attack him from the side that his weapon is not on so using l1 um you know when you're up on his left or l2 to drag your sword and deal bigger damage that is an option so i'm trying my best just to you know get the horse down as quickly as humanly possible i don't know how i managed to avoid that i think i must have dashed uh like frame perfectly but he can slam his horse into you that is another thing that's really tough to uh deal with when it comes to mounted bosses or mounted enemies in general so you want to try to keep him on flat ground as much as possible fighting bosses on slopes in souls games is like it's death it's really really bad it's just not fun to do so just try to keep them on flat ground you don't want to move past the rampart walls however otherwise the archer in the distance will start firing at you almost immediately so you do have to be careful all right so my horse is down but i can see that his horse is only one hit so i'm just gonna knock him down real quick and then we should be able to end the fight here in a second yep so just jump off real quick by pressing l3 walk up get a huge critical and he goes down for your troubles you will receive the ash of war barricade along with the knight rider flail or barricade shield ash of war sorry and the knight rider flail which also deals tons of bleed damage to your enemies it has a decent stat requirement though so be on the lookout for that you

hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the erd tree avatar in the weeping peninsula this is a really cool boss that has a fantastic couple spells that i can use and they're just a treat to look at starting off the boss is primarily just going to use these big lumbering swings with its giant hammer those are easy enough to avoid some of them are kind of like delayed hits like that overhead slam right there so just do your best to look at the boss's hands for when the attack is actually going to come to you after a little bit though the boss will slam its hammer into the ground straight down and then gold stars will get summoned and then those will fly towards you really the easiest way to avoid those are to just run in any one direction constantly and they will all just blow right past you but while you're doing that you need to pay close attention to the boss itself because the boss can recover from using that spell and they just come after you so it can be difficult to avoid everything all at once i'll show you here again just move in a direction and they'll all walk right past her they'll fly right past you not a big deal but you see the boss starts coming after you so you got to watch out very similar to call beyond from bloodborne pretty similar vibes same general strategy to avoid it although this boss is a bit slower than a bratos so that's really the whole boss it has that big uh ground pound butt stomp thing and uh to avoid that you can really just roll right into it very similar to most bosses that have a ground pound like that roll right into it get some free damage on the boss and just go to town i will say this boss took me several attempts because of the amount of damage that it can put out can be deceptive given that this is a field boss however you do have to be mindful of your surroundings because you can aggro some enemies in the area i have no idea where that guy came from i thought the boss started using blood magic on me because i started bleeding but that's the whole fight it's not that difficult and there is a stake of merica right behind it so you can just keep running and attempting that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the black knife assassin this boss for some reason i'm not sure if this was a glitch or if you're going to have the same experience but this boss started with a reduced health bar and i don't know why i defeated the boss on the first try so i wasn't in i didn't even notice that he had no health until very late in the fight so i didn't think to leave and come back and see if it would reset i really have no idea what causes that i recommend having the lamp attached or lantern attached to your hip during this fight the boss arena is very dark and like most games you can only target so far in the dark and because this boss is cloaked in shadow it can be very difficult to see the boss can stack bleed with all of its abilities so you do want to be mindful of that but by the time you reach this boss you should be pretty strong and you should be able to just kill him very quickly but you do want to watch out for that bleed meter that's really the trick here most of it most of his attacks are quite slow and easy to deal with so he shouldn't pose too much of a threat for you that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the tibia mariner i want to first start off by saying that i'm not sure if this boss will appear during the day or if it has to be at night i just ran into this boss by luck uh at night time so if it's not appearing for you here during the day just change it tonight and it should show up starting off the boss will summon a couple of adds when the boss puts up its big horn in the air it's gonna do a really big aoe so you got to watch out for that yep has a big ripple effect there these zombies you do need to kill the white spirits coming out of them upon death otherwise they will not actually die so make sure you do that this way they don't come back to life and start wreaking havoc so you can just walk right into the boss uh the boat won't deal any damage to you it's just everything around the boat can deal damage to you so like that once you see it rising out of the water just move out of the way it's not that big of a deal the boss can teleport so just be sure to look you know whenever that happens and you are in the field so you can summon torrent and ride over more quickly to get back on the boss the boss can be staggered however i don't think there is a riposte animation available and you'll see why i think that here in a moment so i think that's like the one physical attack the boss has is it's just able to like move the boat up and slam it down yeah so there's there's a you know big stagger here that was the full stagger sound that wasn't the partial stagger like some bosses have um but nothing happened so i'm not sure if this boss actually has a repast not too difficult of a boss it was more of like a freak out sort of a moment for me but a really really cool thing defeating the boss you'll receive the skeletal militiamen ashes along with the key item deathroot deathroot is a very special item in this game and to find out what to do with it you want to return to roundtable hold and speak with d hunter of the dead the guy in the really cool armor who's sitting at the table once you get there that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll switch on the cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Omenkiller (Village of the Albinaurics) - Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: NhjMWWqz3OU
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat omen killer in the village of albanorex before starting this fight proper you want to do your best to kill as many dogs that are in the area as possible because this is a field boss this is not just a regular boss fog arena sort of boss and there are a lot of dogs in this area so you want to do your best to kill them as quickly as possible fair warning this is probably the sloppiest boss fight that i've had so far in the game i was able to one-shot it but it is not clean by any means however i am happy to report that i found a move that he does that's easily exploitable hopefully it doesn't get patched in the future i can't imagine it would because it would require some serious ai balancing on this one random field boss but the move that we're going to exploit towards the end of this fight is a triple jump slam that he has after the third jump you can just walk behind him and backstab him he is parriable i can confirm that i'm just not good at pairing an alden ring so i think i'm gonna stop trying but the triple slam is really what we're looking for so in the beginning of this fight i'm mostly just like walking around trying to figure out how to get in on this guy because he's so fast and his fire puts a good amount of distance between you and the boss also the dogs do not help the situation so you can use this uh funeral pyre here to separate the boss in case you want to fight a dog very similar to i guess man eater from demon soul if you want to think of it that way unfortunately the dogs can just hit you with successive attacks over and over and that can be quite frustrating but as long as you're able to kind of get rid of a dog and then reset the fight a bit you're okay the other challenge of this fight is fighting the boss on a slope it is not recommended to fight this boss on a slope you really truly just want to try to get the boss on flat ground but all the flat ground over there is infested by dogs so it's really easier said than done so you saw that triple slam there with a follow-up backstab you have a ton of time to get that backstab in so from here right now we're basically just gonna try to bait out that attack as best we can from what i noticed he does it when he has lower health and when you are at about i'd say like 70 distance from him don't attempt to backstab on the second hit just always try to back up on the third hit because as you saw there i kind of get locked into the backstab animation but no damage is being done and it just sort of whiffs and then you are extremely vulnerable while that's happening but he has a huge recovery time from that third slam so you have plenty of time to go backstab him really not a big deal at all so if you have a shield that can block fire damage highly recommend you equip that unfortunately i didn't i just have this i think it's the inverted hawk heater shield if i'm not mistaken something like that so i wasn't too lucky on blocking fire damage but here we're just baiting out that triple slam over and over and then eventually he will go down he is a really difficult boss probably the boss that gave me the hardest time in terms of it just being like a pure battle of attrition his cleavers stack lots of bleed so that's something you really got to watch out for you want to be very very careful with this boss and bleed if you have any of the berries that he'll bleed you may have found the cookbook for it at this point in the game feel free to use those to reduce the stack or if all the dogs are dead just walk around and wait for it to drop off that's okay as well i did notice there that he actually got stunned while dropping off of that mini ledge i probably could have ran in and got two or three hits in but i just wasn't sure what was happening but he definitely has a long recovery time but that seemed more like a mistake that he made less so something that he could really exploit and that's the final backstab that is omen killer very difficult boss one last hit to go down he's a very difficult boss don't feel bad if it takes you a while the dogs really make it a complete nightmare but that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always also johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for eldon ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the boss spirit collar snail in roads and catacombs the crucible knight is not the boss the boss is an invisible snail that is actually easily seen if you know what to look for it is starting in the back right corner it's surrounded by a white fog and once you hit it a few times it will start to move and teleport around the room if you played bloodborne it's very similar to witches of hemwick but i do want to mention that i did not kill this crucible knight at all and i'm kind of regretting it because i'm wondering if killing him will cause one of the incantations to drop from these crucible knights but i figured if i were to kill it the boss would probably just summon another one but if you have killed it please leave a comment below and let me know what happened okay so you saw there i just hit the snail a few times and then it teleports do the same thing you want to just do your best to keep an eye on the crucible knight easier said than done i know i did notice that the crucible knight generally will not run towards you so if you are able to bring the crucible knight to one corner of the room opposite where you see the snail teleport to and then run to the snail you'll usually have plenty of time to deal a full array of attacks to the boss before it teleports again so you're gonna see here i'm gonna actually kill the boss here and then the crucible knight keeps coming which kind of makes me think that you are able to kill it but i don't know okay so for your troubles you get the glintstone sorcerer's ashes which is pretty cool and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Bols, Carian Knight (Cuckoo's Evergaol) - Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: 7x8gmU57EpM
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down bols the carrion knight in cuckoo's ever jail in lyria of the lakes it is a long title all right so this boss is not that difficult if you've been fighting giants as you've been playing the game you really should know what you're doing at this point but if this is your first time actually encountering one of these and going for it then i'm here to help this boss has the added benefit of having a helmet which means that you can't just jump up and strike him in the head and get a full stun on him you do have to fight in the long way luckily though if you're here at this point in the game you should have a weapon that's somewhat leveled up maybe between plus seven and plus ten depending on how much adventuring you've been doing so you're going to be able to deal decent damage to him the things you want to watch out for are all the things i just failed at watching out for in my demonstration here when he is slamming his sword around you want to be very very careful and watch his hands because when his hands start coming towards you that's when you want to roll with the exception of that overhead slam because he is so tall the slam will hit after you roll if you were to follow my general rule of these games which is pay attention to the enemies hands and roll when they come towards you but this boss is so tall that you will still get hit by that slam so you need to be very careful and delay your roll for that big two-handed overhead slam staying underneath his feet is the general way to go but you do need to watch out for those stomps and then when you hear him cast this glintstone ability you want to just put some distance between you and the boss and then start running in one direction they should all come out to you at the same time sometimes one will stay behind if he's not directly facing you but as long as you're moving in one direction you should still be able to roll through the ones that are coming after you when the boss drags his sword along the ground that is his cue to have a big volley of attacks that he need to watch out for i will say his head is still technically the weak point you'll do a little bit more damage if you hit him in the head but getting to the head is the hard part so yeah one hit there did 132 to the head and then the other hits are doing it about 115 to 120 so it's not like you should just be aiming for the head and waiting for the big parry or riposte opportunity it's not like that just whittle the boss down and you'll be okay so as you can see there he sometimes has a quick stomp that's a little difficult to judge and to dodge but it is what it is so you saw there actually stayed down for that slam because i knew it was coming because when you roll as you're getting up you are invincible as long as you're rolling while getting up so i figured it was better if i just stayed down and then waited rather than getting up and hopefully being able to roll in time so use your put downs to your advantage but that's it that's the boss if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye oh

Title: Ancestor Spirit (Secret Boss) & How to Access It - Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: 7YQ6onXil9E
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the boss ancestor spirit but first i'm going to show you the location of all eight braziers in schieffer river which you need to light all of them in order to actually access the boss fight so we'll do that first quick warning i'm just gonna ride past all the the torches or the braziers because they're all heavily guarded and you will need to either defeat all the enemies around them or you can just sacrifice yourself constantly because you are invincible while lighting the torch this has dark souls rules not dark souls 2 rules you are invincible while doing this so you can just light them and die and move on alright so starting from shifa river i will show you the point of grace that i'm at it's the schieffer riverbank starting here like i said i'm just going to run past all of them real quick the first brazier is right in front of you you're going to light that one then we're going to go to the left and up in this little grove here you'll see in the distance another one so you want to run up there and light that from there we're going to follow along this wall and then there's going to be a third one on an island in this area though there are really powerful magical archers that can shoot you from a great distance you have to be very careful when riding around here so that's number three number four is directly in front of that one you could just follow these lit braziers up a hill and then that's number four you could see it there in the distance we're gonna turn left though and number five is dead ahead but i gotta avoid this lightning orb so we're gonna take a little detour here but number five is gonna be just past this tree right there number six is to the left on that little cliff right there and then there is actually another uh side of grace here that you can rest at if you like i'll show you that on the map now it is the worshipers woods grace point and then there's two up here from this hill there is a teleporter that will bring you up here so if you found that feel free to use it okay so number seven is up on this cliff here however that's probably the most dangerous one because there are big archers all the way in the distance that can snipe you with magical arrows they'll drop you about 50 hp so you want to take this route to climb up there so that's number seven and then number eight is right here these two are surrounded by rats as well so just adds to the challenge i guess once you have lit all eight you can go back to the shifter riverbank point of grace and then you can just ride up the stairs and with all eight braziers lit you'll be able to use the remains as a teleport at the end of this area for the boss fight itself it's actually not that bad um i sort of viewed this as like a set piece moment for the game the music is just so beautiful and the boss moves very slowly and deliberately so it's really just like a battle of attrition you're not gonna be able to deal a ton of damage to the boss at any one time i'm using a plus five weapon at this point and you know not dealing tons of damage to him so if you have fought bosses like uh great wolf sif or royal rat authority or really any sort of beast boss in a souls game you should know what to look out for here if you stand too close to his hind legs he will do a donkey kick and just bat you across the room that deals a ton of damage this move here he's going to jump twice and then on the third one he's going to jump toward you so all you got to do is roll towards him and be able to avoid that damage it's the same exact thing every single time it doesn't have any sort of variations when the boss is about to slam his head into you what i recommend doing is rolling into him this way you sort of get under his belly and then the only other move you really gotta watch out for is this one he will swing his head back and forth this is a prime opportunity for you to jump and get a head shot sometimes however he can do it three times that is a variation the the moves themselves do look a little bit different but it's pretty hard to judge in the moment um but there is a tell between two or three hits it's sort of the angle at which he is moving his neck and then you know if if it seems to be a bit shorter than than the other one he's gonna do it three times rather than two this is gonna be a two hit right here and then you can jump in get a head shot and then this right here this is just one it's a it's a weird little variation i believe he only does one if you're too far away um yeah that's just what i've noticed see i'm not really at max distance there but that's really the whole fight those are all of his abilities he does spit out water onto the ground that'll deal damage to you just very easy to avoid it's nothing serious you do want to make sure that you are not rolling uh if you're underneath him you want to be very mindful of your own positioning because like any from software game really any 3d adventure game the camera is a boss as well so when you're underneath him and the boss is just moving around so so much it can be difficult to tell where you are and in what direction you're about to roll when you press circle so you just want to be very careful and don't you know roll into him if you're underneath him because chances are you're going to roll into the hit rather than avoid it we've got the boss down 50 percent there's no phase two there's no extra abilities as the fight goes on he gets lower on health it's really the same thing over and over again so i have no other commentary because there's no other new moves so i'll just let the fight play out and if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if

Title: Glintstone Dragon Smarag - Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: bBgHcBseu2g
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat glenstone dragon smarag believe it or not smirog is afrikaans for emerald i just found that out because wondering if his name meant anything really cool so this is your typical dragon fight so if you fought flying dragon ag heel in limb grave this fight is very similar with a couple exceptions one the boss has a much bigger arena to fight you in so you're going to be doing a lot more chasing down the other big difference is that the boss has a sort of like a a meteor spell that he can summon and shoot at you it doesn't fall from the sky it's more like a projectile i guess but you'll know it when you see it everything else is basically the same though same sort of dragon fight the head is still very much the weak point i was not able to get this boss staggered unfortunately but that's okay so the boss breathes his breath which looks fantastic and then he's gonna go over here for a while and then we're gonna chase him down and this is the spell i'm talking about he can do it repeatedly if you are at if you stay at a distance however if you close the gap he should only do it once it can't really go behind him but it can go to the side so if you hear him casting it and you're on his side i recommend moving and just giving up your attack and then repositioning because you really do not want to get hit by it deals a lot of damage okay so we're going to chase him down over here and then you will notice that he disappears oh no he despawned now normally i would have stopped recording and tried again but i figured you know what i'll just cut it in post and we'll make do so we're gonna re-aggro the boss he is awake now which i thought was interesting uh very strange indeed so he's awake now so we're gonna go up attack him and then hey his health bar stayed the same so it's the same fight i don't know if that was just me if that would happen to you let me know but the rest of the fight plays out pretty much the same he does still have his standard breath attack where you can just stand on his side and then just wail on his head over and over he still has that which is very very helpful so whenever you see him standing to breathe as long as he's not about to cast that crystal soul mass sort of thing you're pretty much good so we're going to keep chasing him around you don't want to get too far into the into the lake though because you will aggro a bunch of enemies and while smirag can kill them for you you don't necessarily want to rely on it so here's that breath i'm talking about you just literally stand here and hit his head a few times i did change weapons before this fight because i wanted to try out different things from my long sword so i went with this cleaver here and i'm not sure if it just doesn't deal as much stagger damage as a sword would but i was never able to get him staggered even though i was just wailing on his face the whole time so you saw there he shot the crystal it basically went straight which i thought was interesting it didn't actually target me on the side but that's okay the other thing that's maraud can do is he can land on different islands around here which is pretty cool because it is a giant field boss but it can be very difficult to actually fight him on those islands so if you notice that he does land on a mini island and it seems like if you were to get up there the angle wouldn't be conducive to really fighting very well feel free to back up and let him fly somewhere else it's much better that way so you can see here this island in particular he likes to go to a lot he can land at the top of this island and then you're just kind of like screwed from doing damage for a little while at least in my opinion i have attempted to fight him up here but it's not very fun because of the camera angles and all that so just do your best yeah and he goes up here right on cue so attempt to deal some damage but he is going to leave luckily so he's going to go down here you can see this really strange angle he's at it's just not good so just try to back up let him fly away and then do your thing so he's going to slam down only a little bit more health left unfortunately still no stagger i cannot get this ball staggered to save my life today it's quite all right though so this breath here i noticed that uh the flames that are moving towards you like when they hit the ground and they push towards you those flames to me didn't have an active hit box it's the ones on the ground so if you feel like you're getting chased by those flames and they're looking at your feet don't give up just keep going because chances are it's just like the animated flame that's really chasing you and the ones on the ground that deal damage uh you're safe from just keep that in mind so he does that big crystal again like i said there is a chance that he can do that multiple times if you don't close the gap really fast so you want to make sure that when you see him casting that you basically run through him and run behind and then you'll be safe yep here it goes again so it can't necessarily go under him so we just get the last few attacks in and that's it that is glenstone dragon's mourag and the key to the academy is on a corpse where he spawned you actually do not need to even fight this boss if you don't want you could just get the key and move on but hey we're completionists so we kill him anyway that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment

Video ID: YqnHkTbwk3s
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat aiden thief of fire in male factors ever jail in leonia of the lakes long intro okay so this boss is very unassuming in stature however he does a ton of damage he has a flail that can stack bleed very quickly and deal a decent amount of damage alongside a lot of stamina damage he's got to be very careful he also has a few pyromancies most notable of which is that giant orb you just saw the way that works is he can summon the orb when it gets close to you or after a certain amount of time has passed it will flash and then it will explode shortly after that so you got to get away unfortunately it does not damage him in the process it's just for you to deal with lucky you the other pyromancy he has is a combustion of sorts where he's got to be very close range and then he will just sort of explode a fireball in your face that deals a ton of damage as well but given that the boss is humanoid he can heal himself he has one flask of crimson tears that you will have to get through what i did notice is that after he does that swinging flail attack over and over he has about a 50 50 chance of doing a jump attack to follow it up when he does that jump attack you can just walk behind him and get a free backstab that's really the most viable strategy here and the most reliable unfortunately it does require you to wait a while so you do have to deal with that one other thing that i want to mention is that when he summons an orb he has a chance of summoning another one right away you see here did it three times in a row while he is summoning another orb the first one will disappear now that doesn't mean that you can just stand in front of him and keep hitting him because eventually one of those orbs will flash and then explode and then there is a small chance that he summons an orb while another one is in a flash state meaning that he can technically have two orbs on the screen at that point one is about to explode and one is fresh so you can use that knowledge to your advantage and try to get a bit more aggressive with him but you do need to be careful you can't just stand in his face and expect to win but knowing all that and after a little while this one took me a few attempts aiden will go down and then you will actually get the pyromancy that terrorized you flame of the fel god as your reward and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll see johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down crystalline in the reya lucaria crystal tunnel so this boss is a bit of a gimmick it's really not that hard she doesn't deal a ton of damage to you but she can chip away and chances are the adventure getting to this boss really mess you up and you don't have many flasks to spare if any at all so just play it very safe and i'll explain so the way this boss works is because it's a crystal enemy you do need to two-hand your weapon if your one-handed version is bouncing off of her two-handing it will deal damage and that also is true for the enemies within the mine itself if you're having trouble getting them down so the boss can't really walk she just bounces around she can throw her chakram at you and she can also do these very big deliberate swings if you are at a big distance from her she will throw the little one and then you do have to watch out because while it does fly around it can sometimes get caught in the floor geometry and you can't really see where it's going but since we're only dealing 12 damage per hit what we have to do is just keep wailing on her until she sort of explodes and then that means that her crystals around her body are broken and her i don't know if it's her body or just the inner crystal maybe is exposed and then she will start taking damage like a normal enemy so we got her down here nice stagger i think i did hit her in the head but i do believe it was just like a matter of time before that happened and you can see she has cracked all over and so she moves a little bit more slowly she just bounces around more but every single hit is now going to stagger her so once you realize this you could literally just walk up to her and just keep wailing on her and then she'll drop and that's it that's the whole boss fight it's a little bit of a puzzle a little bit of a gimmick it's more here to freak out the reward here you want to bring it to roundtable hold and then the npc that is next to the library area you can give it to that npc and then you'll be able to purchase level one and two smithing shards for runes so anytime you find those tiers bring it to that npc and you'll be able to purchase whatever it unlocks and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the link for that is in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye-bye you

Title: Abductor Virgins (Secret Boss) & How to Reach Them - Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: _XL84qxqoyg
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for eldon ring this time i'm going to show you how to find and defeat a secret set of bosses the abductor virgins so i've broken this video up into two parts so just check the time stamps in the description in case you're just here for a strategy for the boss but first i'm going to show you how to find the boss and all the information that leads up to it and then i'll show you the actual boss strategy so if you just want the strategy just feel free to skip to it the first part of this is for folks that want to know how you're supposed to know where to find this boss in the first place so without further ado let's get started in liernia of the lakes you'll eventually want to find the scenic isle side of grace and there you will find patches the untethered however he will not appear here i don't think unless you found him in the murkwater cave back in limgrave so if he's not here just walk up the river where you fight bloody finger daenerys and look for a cave along a side wall and you'll find patches there fight him let him live and then you'll start his questline once you talk to him you want to select the talk option from his dialogue menu and then he will tell you the story that he heard of how to get closer to the er tree via a shortcut you're making your way to the urge no well i heard something that might help a special means of reaching your destination have you ever seen an iron virgin the clunky contraptions are whirlwinds of sickles and spiked wheels but long ago they were endowed with a spell of transposition and get this a surviving virgin sits at the bottom of the big water wheel in the academy of raya lucaria its transpositional powers fully intact so right if you get caught in it on purpose it'll chuck you out straight at the base of the earth tree so i'm told listening to patches is not required once you have this knowledge yourself you can just go do it patches is not a requirement for this but i figured i would include it just in case folks are wondering how anyone could have figured this out patches is the one who told me so there you go so you want to continue your adventure until you reach the academy of rhea lucaria and then maybe 15 percent of the way through that area you will see the giant water wheel in question you can get onto it once you get near the schoolhouse classroom side of grace so feel free to activate that and then backtrack to the water wheel this way you can come back at any time and then you just want to jump on the water wheel and take it all the way down at the bottom of this area you will need to jump down but you'll land safely but there is an abductor virgin in this area and this is the one that patches is talking about what i recommend doing is running around collecting all the treasures and then you want to deliberately die to this abductor version but you need to die to it by getting caught in its arms i don't think just dying to like the mechanical parts of it will count i do think you need to be abducted by it so once you do that you'll be transported to volcano manor and then you just adventure through the cave there and eventually you will stumble upon the abductor virgin's boss fight for this boss fight in particular i do recommend using a rune arc because you are going to want as much health and stamina as humanly possible for you throughout this fight this is a 2v1 the first abductor version has the wheels and then the other one has swinging sickles in my opinion it is easier to take down the one with the wheels first because it is the most mobile and can chase you down really fast but you always need to keep an ear out for the sickle one because when it locks its hands it's going to throw a sickle at you so what you want to do is when you hear its hands lock wait like half a second maybe one second and then roll to the side if it's to your right you want to roll forward or backwards if it's to your left or right you want to or if it's in front of you you want to roll left or right that's the general strategy for the 2v1 part of this i really do not recommend trying to kill the second one first because the wheel one is always going to be chasing you down so as you saw there the sickle one threw its sickle and i rolled to the side and i didn't get hit but the sickle can hit you when the uh abductor version is pulling it back so you have to be very very careful the back of the blade has teeth as well the other thing that i really want to call out for this fight is the arena itself you'll see that there are cages all around and i'm currently getting stuck on them there's really not much that can be done about that i'm thinking maybe maybe you're supposed to jump on top of them and then possibly deal damage to the heads maybe that's a strategy i didn't actually think of that until just now i kind of don't think it is but it is possible in any event you really just want to keep your distance from the sickle one and then keep baiting the wheel virgin to come after you when you see its hands come out it is basically going to try to chase you down and then you want to just go for it you don't have to wait for the arms to be exposed to deal damage but when those arms are exposed you will deal a lot more damage than if they were locked up just keep that in mind you can attack it both times i do want to mention that the sickle virgin right now is doing the swinging move while it is doing that believe it or not you can actually just stand in front of it and as long as it's not moving around like as long as the wheels on it are not moving back and forth and it's not moving around the room you are completely safe while it is swinging its sickles around itself so i'll employ that strategy once we get that one on its own at this point i'm just trying to play it a little bit safe because i only have three flasks left and i did use my wondrous flask shield which is a bit of a bummer so at this point i'm really just trying to keep an eye out for the sickle version and luckily i was able to finally get the wheel one down so here it's going to start swinging it sickles when it's only doing with one hand you cannot stand near it you do have to back away but here we go it's gonna start moving at sickles and then as you see i'm able to just follow it i don't even have to roll when it's close by and then i can just start attacking it so this one stands still more that's why i recommend taking out the wheel one first and then if this one is standing still you absolutely can just walk up to it and go for it however you do need to be a little bit careful because of the teeth on the back sides of those blades but really once it's a 1v1 fight it's super easy for your troubles you get the inquisitor's gear and dole and then you also get a shortcut to a new area and that's it that's the whole secret if you have any questions please

Title: Tibia Mariner (Wyndham Ruins) - Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: IOu_2Pnc4BM

hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the tibia mariner in mount gelmere this fight does not have to be done at night i was mistaken in saying that the last time it did appear for me during the day here so this tibia mariner is a little bit crazier than the one in limb grave which makes sense considering this is a late game area i think so it has this giant skeleton that it can summon throughout the fight i don't actually recommend doing anything about it just avoid it it's really all you got to do there's no point in trying to kill it the lake that this tibia mariner has access to is huge so you will be doing a lot of chasing it down so all you want to do is just stay on the horse try your best not to get knocked off i will get knocked off once but once you're around here you can basically just stand here on your horse and just attack the boss there are some undead skeletal warriors here that can annoy you if you'd like you can focus on them first just make sure they stay dead by attacking the white goo your spirit goo that's coming out of them as they die otherwise they will just get right back up you do not need a divine weapon to keep them dead and there's no necromancer controlling them so it's really just them and they're white goo but while all this is going on the giant skeleton that the tibia mariner likes to summon is going to be harassing you so what you can do is you can wait for the tibia mariner to kill the skeletons itself and then go in and just hit the white goo once or twice to get it over with but if you're like me you were kind of panicking the whole time because this is the first time you saw the boss and you didn't really know what to do so the boss has a couple of physical attacks it can also like spray the spiritual water at you that will also deal damage you got to be careful of that whenever you see a pink aura come out of the boss's horn that means that the giant skeleton is going to be summoned so that is something you got to watch out for you can see there i did get knocked off my horse not a big deal though it didn't kill it i was able to summon it right away but because i got so annoyed i just decided let me wail on the boss for a little bit all right so when the boss puts its horn all the way up in the air it's going to eventually slam it and deal a big aoe uh damage ring so you can just jump over that or just move away to avoid it for a little while so here comes the big skeleton again and then the boss is going to teleport in a second here and where it moves really confused me i'm not sure if this is a bug or if this is intentional but it is no longer in the water and so after a couple seconds of trying to figure it out i see some pink in the distance and for some reason the boss moved up onto the cliff so not sure if they'll patch that out but don't fear the boss isn't going to despawn he can apparently rub a boat on land i mean he's undead he do what he wants so while up here the giant skeleton will also join him and there are some skeletal warriors around so you do still need to be careful for those but not nearly as many in the lake so the giant skeleton can shoot a beam out of its mouth it's not too difficult to avoid and it you know if you're fighting on this hill chances are it's just sort of level so it's just going to go right over your head which isn't the end of the world it's actually quite nice but yeah that's basically the whole fight just got to watch out for the boat slams they're not that deadly at this point uh you're probably here pretty late in the game or you took the shortcut from the abductor virgins so nothing here should be killing you in one hit the the mariner himself shouldn't be dealing that much damage to you maybe the giant skeleton's breath if you get caught in it can deal a decent amount of damage but that's really the only thing you should have to worry about so that big splash does deal a decent amount but we could heal that back up in one flask no big deal and then we get the last few hits on the boss and that's it that's the tibia mariner of mount gelmere and the skeleton goes along with him you will get a death roof for your troubles so go feel free to trade that later and then you also get the tibia summons spirit and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always also johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Bloodhound Knight (Lakeside Crystal Cave) - Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: NytIueRjw7g
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the bloodhound knife boss in the crystal cave so this boss is not that difficult chances are you might have fought this exact enemy once or twice before there is one of them in an ever jail in the weeping peninsula that you may have thought and then another one shows up in another area somewhat nearby so this boss can be parried however i am terrible at it the main thing you want to watch out for is the bleed this is very easy to lose track of and once you uh get that meter filled you're going to take a ton of extra damage so you do want to be very careful i don't know if this boss can be backstabbed i have tried several times and have been in positions where it felt like it should have worked but i think because the boss is on all fours backstabs just don't work i mean right there i feel like that was like perfect backstab range or whatever but it just didn't happen so what you want to watch out for is that the boss moves around very quickly as you can see and then its movements are somewhat erratic with respect to its charging move it has a few options there if you notice that it puts its left hand in the ground it will drag it towards you and then do sort of like an upswing with the claw and then it will slam down with the sword in its right hand so you do want to watch out for that the other thing that can happen is that i can just drag the sword itself and then it won't uh even use the claw you gotta look out for which hand is actually in the ground the other thing too is that the boss has sort of like a shadow step or a teleport almost and when it does this it isn't visible however it can still be hit but chances are it's going to attack immediately so you're probably just going to take a bunch of damage when you should have just waited for an opening but that's it that's the blunt hound night and it's not too difficult considering you probably did this once before at least for your troubles you get the cerulean amber medallion and then you can move on and complete what you're here for that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always also johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Video ID: hWO5kbFEaiU
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat red wolf of radigan this boss is sort of like amaterasu mixed with sif mixed with other stuff it's a really cool boss unfortunately it's kind of weak at this point i did have a plus 10 weapon and i was around i think level 40. so i was taking it down pretty quick but it was such a pleasure to look at let me tell you so it has some standard wolf-based attacks meaning it can just sort of like move into you with its teeth and that'll deal some damage however it does also possess magic so when you see the blue orbs appear as it's running you want to just keep your eye on them and then wait for the homing crystal soul mass swords to come out or the glintstone arc swords to come out and then once that happens you want to just move in a direction and roll very late they all sort of move quickly so just moving side to side probably will not do the trick the other thing you want to watch out for is the sword that it can create in its mouth it has a couple of attacks that can do here it can either swing once twice or three times a lady and then it will slam down for the third attack the fourth thing that it can do is that big spinner rooney you saw there that one is a little difficult to judge i recommend just trying to very late roll into the boss and you should be able to avoid everything but that's it for your troubles you get a memory stone which allows you to attune another spell and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always also johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon - Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: zrHjevvBSkM
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat ranala queen of the full moon this is a full two-phase encounter meaning you have to deplete her health bar two full times in order for her to be defeated in this first phase you need to find the little sweeting that has a gold aura around her and she's also the only one throwing books at you and she's also the only one singing i do believe once you defeat three of those you don't even actually have to kill them you just have to hit them so it breaks the seal but once you do that three times the boss will drop and then you can just lay into her for all you have you want to try to drop her below 50 this way you can get this done in two cycles but once you see the gold aura start again that is when she is going to sort of explode and the crystal will reform around her and then you got to do it all over again so the little sweetings on the ground some of them can breathe fire onto you if they have candlesticks the other thing you got to watch out for is that the chandeliers in the back part of the arena those can drop so you have to be very very careful but just run around find the three little sweetings hit them and drop the boss and then phase two will begin at this point if you are low on health i recommend using a rune arc this way you get a full restore and then some and then starting off in this incredible looking second phase you want to try to rush the boss and get behind her this way that kamehameha wave doesn't deal too much damage to you when the boss forms this moon you can just back up and then you want to wait for the moon to explode and then while that's happening you want to do your best to keep an eye on the boss she has a couple attacks she can do she has these sort of starfall attacks she has these crystals these will shoot into you and then she has a crystal burst that one you can actually roll through if you're close enough you can get right behind it the starfall one is easy enough to avoid you could really just walk past it but this little sickle here with her staff that's the tough one because if that actually hits you then you're gonna get stuck and she can also follow it up the moon is probably the most damaging attack unless you get caught up in the sickle and then when she gets below 50 hp she gets a few more attacks we'll see those here in a second so she has that one crystal ray that's not too difficult when she slams her staff into the ground she's going to summon a spirit this spirit should be ignored however you should try to keep your eye on it because it will still deal damage to you but eventually it'll just disappear it only stays out for about five seconds so she has a few different things she can spawn she can form the uh the bloodhound night she can get wolves she can also get a dragon which yes you heard that correctly she can get a dragon and then she can also get one of the giants that you see all around the world so really you just gotta watch out do your best to stay in her face this attack right here that's the deadliest one if you see her doing that either hold up your shield to block it or if you're able to roll away but it's really really tough timing so here comes the dragon it's gonna breathe fire but summoning the dragon takes her a while so we're able to chase her down and defeat her the name of the second phase is to rush her down you do not want to let this go on too long otherwise she's going to summon a spirit that will eventually take you down but that's it that's the whole fight you get the remembrance and the great rune and the trophy for your efforts and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for eldon ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll see johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Royal Knight Loretta (Caria Manor) - Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: z6wb9Cgnb8Q
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat royal knight loretta apologies in advance for the lack of music in this video it's not you it's me i forgot that i had muted the music levels uh earlier when i was trying to do something so apologies for that all right so royal knight loretta is a pretty unfair fight in some ways she's on horseback and since this is technically an indoor area you cannot summon your horse and make this a joust so you do just have to deal with it sort of like you probably did fighting tree sentinel in the very beginning of the game you will notice that her spear is both a weapon and a catalyst so she can cast spells with her own weapon the spells come out of the butt of the spear near the handle and then the physical attacks come from the blade so depending on which way the spear is facing you can kind of anticipate what's going to come next she has these glint blade sorceries that surround her sort of like a homing crystal soul mass when those are being cast you actually can get a couple hits on her before they really become active because she's technically not facing you most of the time so with that said when those are coming after you you could just move in one direction and you'll just walk right past them or if you're very close you will need to roll because uh when they are closer they will travel quite quickly so she has standard fare spear attacks if you remember your fight with tree sentinel from the beginning of the game the physical portion of this fight shouldn't be too much of an issue when you're standing behind the horse you do want to be careful because the horse can donkey kick you if you're not careful and that can deal a ton of damage and put you down on the ground so as we work through the boss here she really only has two spells that she casts for the first part of the fight that is the glimp blade sorcery and she has a soul arrow of sorts like this right here she can cast a few of these in rapid succession so you do have to watch out for those and then once the boss gets down to about 50 or so she starts to get much stronger magic so that's when things get really really tricky so yeah donkey kick happens there now that she's at about 50 she's gonna start doing some more stuff so she puts up her shield and that means phase two has started so these glint blades now have eight instead of four so a lot more and then a huge arrow can be shot but that's actually much easier to deal with than you might think as long as you stay close to the boss that arrow poses no threat but the soul arrows do pose a threat because now there's four of them instead of just one so it's really just beefs the fight up to 11 when she gets below 50 so i know this is easier said than done but you want to try to end the fight quickly once this happens so if you've been saving any uh any spirit summons or anything use them now because you're really not going to get another opportunity and they may be able to at least get the boss off of you for a little bit and that's one way to go but my first playthrough i didn't like to use those so the physical attacks stay exactly the same but she will be weaving in a lot more magic so you've got to be careful if you have any shields or anything from a wondrous flask feel free to use those during this part of the fight her blade can be enchanted with magic that ability that she used that last one is really rare i only saw it once or twice in my attempts but when she goes down you get loretta's great bow for your troubles and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll see johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Alabaster Lord (Royal Grave Evergaol) - Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: CX0pqP43ppE
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the alabaster lord in the royal grave ever jail chances are you have fought variations of this boss a couple times however this one has new spells one of which you will receive for defeating him so starting off the boss usually summons a meteor shower this happens when the boss stabs his sword into the ground and you are not close enough to distract him from casting the spell so that is sort of the name of the game here is to just stay close to the boss most of his physical attacks can be parried so if you feel skilled enough to go for that by all means you only need to parry him once to get a full riposte it's not one of those big body bosses where you got to parry him twice while you are close range he still does have a couple spells he can do a sort of like back off maneuver that first spell you saw where it's just almost like a combustion where he just pushes you away and then he can also stab the ground and if you are close enough he won't follow it up with a meteor shower if you notice that the sword is still glowing after a second just hit him it'll distract him out of the spell and he can move on so like i said his attacks can be parried if you are feeling saucy enough to go for it and since we were close enough to him he did not cast a meteor shower that's that's pretty much what i noticed throughout the fight is that if you're close enough he won't cast it uh he only casts it if you're far away and if he does cast it you've got to run because those meteors are big and they deal a lot of damage unfortunately the boss cannot be backstabbed at least in my experience if you saw something different please let me know happy to be wrong and i could uh pin the comment for everybody but my experience he could not be backstabbed so the fight after you kind of get used to his spells very much rinse and repeat there's no second phase he doesn't do anything special after he loses a lot of life or anything so it's really just a battle of attrition and constantly repeating the process so we've got him down to about 25 health here like i said he doesn't do anything special at low health but one thing i do want to call out is that with these vertical slams of his sword sometimes he can drag the sword back with him and the drag will also deal damage to you so you always want to be mindful of where his weapon is and if his if his hand is ever moving with the weapon chances are the blade has a hurt box and can deal damage to you so you got to be careful with that got to be very careful with the sword drags he has that one spin a rooney move never really did it too much that's the drag i'm talking about if i were in front of him while he did that it would have dealt damage to me just be careful of the drag it's very deceptive but that's it the alabaster lord goes down and you get the meteorite sorcery that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll see johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the erd tree avatar in the eastern area of lyria of the lakes you will notice that there are a lot of enemies around this boss however if you were to just ride around the side along the rocks you can actually approach the boss from the rear and then fight it behind the earth tree and not have to worry about any of the adds this is what i recommend doing so this er tree avatar has the same abilities as the one in the western region so not too much to worry about here has some sweeping strikes an overhead slam and they can cast two spells it has a ground pound that emits a big golden aoe but you can just roll right through that it's not a big deal this attack right here roll in get some extra damage and all you got to do for the next spell that he will cast here in a moment he's going to slam his hammer down on the ground just pick a direction left or right and run in it constantly until all the stars are gone and you will have avoided all of them successfully nothing to worry about with his physical attacks you generally just want to watch his hands and then when his hands start moving towards you that's when it's time to roll his hammer is really big but it can't actually hurt you until it starts moving towards you so that's the whole trick and that's generally a rule of all these games souls and elden ring don't move until the hands are coming at you so that's sort of the fight he will repeat the same moves for a while during this star fall attack you want to be mindful of where the boss itself is because while the stars are chasing you the boss can do follow-up physical attacks so you want to make sure that you are not you know running towards him or you know not paying attention to him because he is deceptively fast for a big guy the boss can be staggered and then you get to stab it in the trunk i guess i don't know what that's supposed to be and then the fight ends and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll see johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to find and defeat the black knife assassin in the black knife catacombs this path is pretty interesting you have to ride those blades up and then walk through this hallway there will be enemies but they are defeated this is the route that you have to take in order to access the regular boss but the wall in front of me right here is illusory so you want to hit it and then you'll see the gold fog guarding this next door inside is the black knife assassin so this boss is pretty crazy it is parriable and very susceptible to backstabs and that's actually what we're gonna do we're gonna employ a strategy of nothing but backsteps pretty much and that'll help us take down the boss so what we want to do is we want to wait out this big overhead attack that the boss has it'll do it here in a couple seconds and then once the boss does the overhead slam you have a lot of time to walk behind it and backstab it i seriously mean a lot of time the final backstab of this fight is gonna shock you how long you have so just wait for the boss to flip over you walk behind it back stab and that's it and then you can get one or two pot shots on the boss before having to repeat the process now surprisingly this boss does not stack bleed even though it's using a dagger and it is an assassin i could have sworn its stacked bleed when i was fighting it but i guess i was wrong so right now we're just waiting for the boss to do the flip i'm trying not to get too greedy with too many hits but there you go there's another backstab and then i have a talisman that restores my health on criticals so that's very nice so this spin move it's pretty deceptive the boss spins about two and a half times before fully committing to the attack so it's really just there to kind of mess with you a bit tried to use my wondrous flask shield but no luck so i almost got the backstab there i was kind of hesitant because i didn't realize how much time i had so i just committed to doing one one attack and that was it the boss is parriable but given the speed i just don't recommend trying unless you're really skilled at it by all means go for it let me know how it turns out but for me i just didn't want to bother so we're going to get one more flip move here and then we're going to be able to kill the boss here it is get a backstab so much time so much time and we're actually gonna get one more so that would have been it you just have a ton of time to make it happen nothing too crazy to worry about the space that you're fighting the boss in is the real challenge and because of the boss's speed you really cannot get away from it so that's that's why it's hard all right so here comes the the red blade one more time the projectile and then we get one more flip plenty of time for a backstab and that's it that's a black knife assassin the boss drops a dagger as well as the black knife print and the black knife print is the interesting key item here so make sure to read that description and the dagger is a talisman and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment on my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'm sweet johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the cemetery shade in the black knife catacombs chances are you fought one of these before earlier on in the game this one has the added benefit of having three ads in the room so first things first we are going to try to get to the back of the room as quickly as possible to take out the sniper with the bow and arrow back there unfortunately my weapon wasn't too powerful at this point so this did take way more hits than i would have liked but don't forget when you kill a skeleton you've got to kill the white goo that's coming out of him in order for it to actually work so i have a talisman that restores health upon riposte or backstab so that's why i went for that and luckily the boss kind of played along and was not harassing me the whole time the major thing you got to watch out for with this boss is bleed as you can see there boss only hit me three or four times and my bleed is already 90 of the way full so you really got to be careful with that i recommend staying at full health you should have plenty of flasks at this point and if you're entering the room with only one or two then what i recommend doing is leaving or dying deliberately going back to the point of grace restoring all of your flasks and then just running to the boss highly recommend so i just put blood flame blade on my uh on my weapon and it's dealing decent damage which i was very surprised to see but blood flame stacks bleed itself this is a ghost ghosts can't bleed so it wasn't really uh too helpful but there you go that's a cemetery shade it's really the ads that make this fight a problem other than that the boss itself is pretty weak and that's it one thing i do want to mention is that there is a treasure chest to the right of the teleport out of the boss room that chest contains the death root that your black eye was telling you about while you were in this dungeon so don't leave without it and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'm sweet johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella - Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: ziHLTaB9ToM
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for eldon ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the dragonkin soldier of knox stella this is a really cool set piece moment for the game and i want to mention a funny little anecdote the first attempt i had on this boss i got it down to about 50 hp and then it turned around and i said hey those look like wings under its cloak and sure enough the wings came out and i couldn't believe it alright so the fight itself really isn't that bad the first phase of the fight the boss just sort of fights like one of the giants that you've encountered countless times by this point just does a lot of hand slamming doesn't have a weapon out so you don't worry about any big sweeping strikes or anything but you will notice that if the boss leaves his hands in the ground for too long and is not moving is not tracking you anymore it's going to do an earthquake when it rips its hands out of the ground you're going to get picked up and deal a bunch of damage and then leave you exposed for a follow-up so if you notice that happening i'm failing to demonstrate it here but delay an extra roll and then you'll be okay all right so the boss is going to sprout wings when it gets down to about 55 60 health and then it starts flying around and the fight changes drastically so this attack here is a lightning frost ability and it deals lightning damage and builds the frostbite meter what you want to do is you want to just avoid that lightning until the boss sort of floats in the air and stares at you this is signaling that it's going to start flying towards you and then as soon as that happens just roll into the boss and then you will be able to chase it down and deal some damage it will also do this again while it's on the ground it'll do a big dash chase and then you can just run around and hit its feet for a little while so that's sort of the added features of phase two the lightning does deal frostbite so you gotta look out for that when it chucks the lightning bolt into the ground it's going to fan out bolts of electricity on the ground you want to just run and jump out of that and then you should be safe and then the boss just does it again and that's basically the fight so when the boss slams down it is still able to do the earthquake but now it'll build frostbite here in phase two so you got to be careful one thing i do want to mention is you don't want to fight this thing too close to the gold mist near the throne because that is a waterfall that you can fall down and die so you want to do your best to keep the boss near the middle of the room not against any walls and certainly not against this throne if you can help it and that's it that's the whole fight unfortunately the boss flew away before i can get the final hit in that's okay gives me more time to demonstrate these attacks here somehow made it out of that one couldn't believe that and just roll through that final one unfortunately it slammed me i got hit with the frostbite but it exposed itself for one final hit and that's it for your troubles you get a trophy the frozen the frozen lightning spear sorcery and then there's also a treasure chest within the throne itself and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Grafted Scion - Rematch (Chapel of Anticipation)- Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: oVXTHiRyqmc
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to find and defeat the grafted scion which is the first boss of the game that you were able to get revenge on not 100 certain if you can actually realistically defeat the boss in the beginning of the game and if you get any rewards from that but you are able to return to the chapel of anticipation and rematch the boss and take it down so there's an area in lunaria of the lakes called the four belfries once you find this area the belfry immediately below the one with the treasure chest at the top is the one that sent you to the chapel of anticipation and then once here you can just rematch the boss in my experience there's nothing else here aside from this pickup right here these blue butterflies that seems to be the only unique item here and they are farmable it seems if you come back every once in a while so be sure to grab those they're called nascent butterflies not exactly sure what recipe they're needed for but those are available and then once you're ready to just enter the fog and here he is waiting for you once again but by the time you get back you're big and strong you've got way more stamina way more health and you're able to take them down somewhat easily chances are you've definitely fought at least one of these in your adventures so far so you should know the drill boss has lots of sweeping strikes this rolling attack he always follows up with another two slices hopefully he rolls into you this way you can get some damage on him if not no big deal so when he has his hands up he's gonna do some stabs and then he will end it with a sweep and then you gotta watch out because he can do some backstep strikes those are a little difficult to manage because he just moves so quickly whenever you see his shield move away from him that is basically a tail that he's going to attack so you want to be careful with that he also has a shield slam albeit it does come out very rarely he has a scream that builds terror but once the scream actually starts believe it or not you can run into him and not take any damage from the scream and then you can get some free hits on him so this big big slash attack ends with a cross but then there are times where he has followed that up again almost like he cancels the animation when the boss is below 50 hp he can buff his weapons um just deals extra damage nothing you know to really worry about i don't think um yeah and that's sort of it all the attacks are the same he doesn't get anything special you got to watch out for the jump though that can be quite deadly and then of course all of his successive attacks can be a little frustrating to deal with because sometimes you just want to deal with last hit then he runs away and he can't do anything and it's just a mess but that's pretty much it he's probably at literally one hp right now whenever he this hand up back up because he's gonna do this big spin and if you get caught in that it's almost certain death kind of no matter how much hp you have but that's it once you defeat the grafted scion you will get the sword and shield as your reward and that's all there is to it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye-bye you

Title: Bell Bearing Hunter (Church of Vows) - Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: CxuCXU_50cA
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the bell bearing hunter in the church of vows getting this boss to appear is a bit tricky it has to be nighttime but you also need to rest at the point of grace in order to get the tortoise to despawn allowing the boss to spawn so even if you are here at night if the tortoise is still here you need to rest at the side of grace and then the tortoise will disappear as if the tortoise is here the boss isn't going to show up so that's sort of the rule so if he's not here just rest you should be good to go okay so the boss itself is quite challenging it has this really cool sword that it can actually send out to attack you very similar to symphony of the night which is very nice to see the boss can be parried however in order to get a riposte you need to parry the boss twice parrying once will only stagger it you can still get a couple cheap hits in for free damage when you stagger him the first time but in order to get the full riposte you do need to parry him twice so if you're not feeling super confident in your parries maybe just stick to blocking the thing to look out for though is that when the sword is glowing red it is no longer actually in his hands and what happens after that is not necessarily unpredictable or anything but the sword will move very very quickly so you got to be careful with that the boss cannot be backstabbed unfortunately but because it can be parried you're able to get some decent damage in anyway the other thing you got to look out for he does it very rarely but the boss does have a shield slam ability that he will pull out towards the end of my fight with him so he will demonstrate it at least once it's very rare though i only ever saw it once in like four or five attempts on this boss so nothing too much to too difficult to worry about he does have a grab however it's somewhat easy to avoid but it is tricky because his hand will glow for a long time before he actually moves the hand towards you so he's doing this sort of freak you out bait you into rolling right away which i'm absolutely guilty of and then he will grab you anyway but what you want to do is you want to just wait for the hand to actually move towards you before rolling when the boss uh lets go of his sword and it starts flying around the room you do need to be careful because when the boss pulls the sword back it's pulling it back blade first which means that it can actually stab you so you got to be careful keep blocking that whole time or just get ready to roll out of the way when it's coming back so you saw the shield slam there the shield wasn't even in his hand took it off of his back captain america style and just slammed it on the ground but that's it that's the bell bearing hunter difficult fight but really cool the bell that he drops you can bring to roundtable hold and then it opens up some some selections of meats to purchase for currency and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Godrick the Grafted - Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: aZjqs0AFooc
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat godric the grafted you can summon the philly lou for this fight just outside the fog wall however i'm doing this one solo in phase one godric moves in a more lumbering fashion he's not that quick this move right here is probably the most devastating of the bunch he will do a delayed slam straight down with his battle axe and then do some sort of like earthquake but it's the second hit of that earthquake that will really trip you up and it will basically eat all of your stamina if you're not careful so with this whirlwind he has a couple of choices after he does the whirlwind he can roll towards you that's really the best one in my opinion is easiest to avoid and you can easily get a lot of follow-up damage on it or i'll show you the next move he can do in a little bit so he's gonna do another ground pound here once you see him turn the battle axe upside down and start to bring in another one of his hands from the left that is when it's time for you to back up and get ready so the second move here is this really cool wind attack uh very similar it's sort of like a leveled up version of the attack that the uh that the knights were doing in the castle so he's gonna do another ground pound here we're almost down to phase two believe it or not phase two starts at about 60 hp so when he's got all of his hands up and swinging multiple axes you want to do your best to avoid uh the first four attacks and then the fifth attack you want to try to roll through this way you can get damage while he's recovering that one is always five attacks easier said than done especially if he starts it while you are close to him so that's the attack you really want you can't really do much to bait out any of them it's really a 50 50 which one he chooses when he stops moving and starts screaming a cutscene's about to play i'll go ahead and remove this and then once phase two has started he gets the head of a dragon because why not he is a grafter after all so in this phase uh he has a lot of the same moves but instead of having his left hand holding another axe now it's a lot of dragon attacks the vast majority of them are physical and are easy enough to avoid however the fire attacks not so much the fire attacks are deceptively fast in my opinion so he still rolls around this move is basically the same it just has a cool fire effect and deals some elemental damage if you do get hit by it but it's the same timing and everything not too difficult to avoid the other flame attack is a breath that he just sort of sweeps around that one is deceptively difficult to avoid and what i mean by that is you gotta roll through it but it's not like a steady timing in my opinion you really just gotta play it by ear you'll also notice that for the ground pound that he did or the earthquake he does it three times in phase two now so that's something to watch out so one two and then a big third one with an even bigger shock wave so you really want to back up for that really really important so it's just a big jump slam there nothing too crazy he's got a couple sweeps with his battle axe and now he's gonna do uh a straight flame breath this just sort of like puts fire on the ground i got caught on the dragon unfortunately so i wasn't able to avoid any of that but luckily i actually fought him somewhat late i have a plus five flask and seven of them so easy enough for me to heal through not too bad but when he just sort of like lifts up the dragon head and it's not really going anywhere but it is breathing fire that's your cue to run away because the ground is going to be filled with fire one thing that i didn't get to showcase unfortunately because he didn't do it is a grab he does still have the grab that he saw on the trailer however it's easy enough to avoid it's not nearly as fast as they made it seem and if you're staying close to him throughout the fight you'll really never see it but that's it that's godric if you want you can go do this little quest here that's on the screen the great rune the location of the tower or the path to the tower is at the start of stormville castle go up the ramp through the ballista fire and then just turn right and there's a room with some knights in it and a staircase and a lost side of grace and that's the path to do that great room quest really cool quest but that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help

Title: Magma Wyrm Makar (Ruin-Strewn Precipice) - Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: 2rkUADq72n4
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down magma worm macar this boss is pretty interesting it's a worm so it's a dragon that can't fly it has wings but you can see that they're shredded it just sort of slithers around like an alligator and you just kind of gotta handle that he does have a sword that is quite large so you have to deal with magma coming out of his mouth at various points and in various ways this big walking around thing will happen over and over throughout the fight and then he also has a pretty big sword and with that sword the main thing you gotta look out for is when he swings it or slams it down he can pull it back and when he pulls it back that also deals damage so whenever he is about to shoot fire really in any form you can get under his belly and start dealing some decent damage the one that you really gotta watch out for that can catch it by surprise is he's able to look to his side and then shoot a fireball in that direction and if you're close enough to his mouth and not far enough under his body you can get hit by it and that can deal a lot of damage and lead to a lot of follow-up damage as well but pretty much every other fire breath can just be rolled through by getting closer under his belly and he should be fine the magma walk ability this one right here this one can get a little frustrating because he just sort of runs away from you and it slows down the fight and he resets just a little frustrating but when the boss hits 50 hp he will start to do attacks where he stands on his hind legs which you're seeing here now he has a fireball that he can throw it doesn't go very far then he also has this big stream of fireballs and those basically go the entire screen so those you have to watch out for when he's on his hind legs he gets a bunch of spin moves that are a little difficult to anticipate and time you really just want to pay attention to his weapon because when the weapon is moving it can hurt you i know that sounds obvious but he does a lot of movement and he's just sort of flashy with it when the main thing you really got to be watching out for is a sword and when he's doing these things you really shouldn't be standing underneath him for too long of a period of time right here i was just kind of getting lucky because i was recognizing that he was about to slam his weapon down because his belly would sort of clench and move in a way that it wasn't moving before that's just the pattern that i picked up on that allowed me to stay under here and i got him in a pretty good pattern but normally what you would want to do is when he is sort of sliding around and slamming his weapon around you don't want to be near him because it can be a little erratic and when he is swinging his sword around his body is also moving and then that can catch you and drag you along with him which is really really devastating and can lead to a ton of damage so this move right here gotta be really careful for because he can roll over on you that can deal damage the sword swipe can deal a decent amount of damage as well and you're just sort of at a loss when that happens eventually you'll get used to the pattern and he will go down for your trouble you get the magma warm scale sword along with a dragon heart be sure to check back at the church of dragon communion to see if there are any new spells available for you to purchase but that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll see johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Godskin Noble - Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: dAxUwl1oCWY
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the godskin noble this is a really interesting fight and given that it's a church with some pillars if you're a dark souls fan you should know what that means you're going to have to do so this guy is a fencer i have a friend of mine who fences and i'm sure he's gonna love to see this boss he stabs a lot obviously but what this means is that he can drain your stamina super fast because it's all piercing damage a 100 uh physical block shield will block the damage however you will take a ton of stamina damage in the process the boss can also summon these white fireballs and he can also put a ring around himself and that you just have to roll out of there's really no other way around it he can sort of push his belly out like you saw there when that hits you it won't deal a ton of damage it's a little hard to predict or even dodge unless you're at a good distance already but if you're trying to get in his face to do things chances are you're probably going to get hit by a at least once when the boss has a really long charge he's going to do a big thrust similar to the grafted scions for that you just want to roll you will usually only do it once so it's not too much to worry about one thing i do want to mention is if you watch my videos you know it's pretty rare for me to use any sort of buffs but this guy is really weak to bleed he is just a humanoid enemy after all and so if you have anything that can stack bleed you use it on this boss he will explode with damage once the bleed stacks all the way and blood flame blade is a really good way to do that if you have the faith requirement so the other thing i want to mention is that he is parriable so if you are feeling confident and comfortable dealing with his abilities then just try to parry them you should be able to survive at least one hit maybe two if you fail a parry but if you're not if you have enough health to survive that don't try pairing unless you're very very confident sometimes the boss will inflate himself and when he does that he's gonna do one of two moves he is either going to fly up into the air like this and slam down that's easy enough to avoid or the other thing he can do is he can inflate and then begin rolling around when he rolls around that's when you want to use the pillars and that's going to happen here in a second so he's going to inflate and then i'm going to get him stuck between these two pillars and then it's going to make my life a whole lot easier this move right here the double slam down with the hilt of the sword with the skull crusher it's really easy to avoid just make sure you dodge two of them it's always two i don't think i've ever seen them do it just once it's always too so just dodge twice and you'll be good to go so you see here he inflates and then i can literally just stand here and he cannot touch me if you have any spells go ahead and cast him if you got him caught like this otherwise just wait it out after he finishes spinning he does kind of pause for a moment so you can get a couple free hits in that's pretty much it so with that explosion it's the same thing as phase one except now it deals a little bit of magic damage and a little bit more physical damage but it's the same sort of puffing up ability that's a little hard to dodge and that's kind of it that's godskin noble he's gonna pound down here one more time unfortunately i'm gonna take the hit because i was just so surprised i was able to get him down this far on this attempt one thing i do want to mention is you should stay close to him i know that seems a little counterintuitive but if you are at arm's length of this boss he is able to really shred your health and if you're blocking he can just completely guard break you so just be careful with that just stay in his face for defeating the boss you'll receive the godskin stitcher as well as the noble presence art of war and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: God-Devouring Serpent & Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy - Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: 1kTIGWWi00k
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the god devouring serpent and reichard lord of blasphemy as soon as you enter the arena you'll pick up a weapon this is the serpent hunter you want to equip this weapon regardless of what your stats are this weapon has zero stat requirements strength intelligence arcane dexterity faith all zero you can use this no matter what your build is and you're supposed to use it in this fight if you're a fan of from software games this is the storm ruler of eldon ring but this fight is way crazier than any storm ruler fight in history so you'll notice that the unique skill is a great serpent hunt perform a powerful forward lunge and follow up with an upward thrust via an additional input so if you've never really messed with the ashes of war in this game it's pretty simple what you want to do is you want to two-hand the weapon press l2 and then press l2 again after the first hit and you will do a massive amount of damage the boss will be stunned after you do that however you cannot just spam this move and keep the boss stun locked you do have to weave in normal attacks with the weapon with just your regular r1 attack and it will deal decent damage but it deals the most damage when you hit the boss a second time so the first hit was 747 and by the time we got to the second hit it was over 2000 so the most damage gets done on the second hit so here in phase one the boss has a few attacks it can slam its head at you either twice or three times very rarely will it do it once but the tell for the third one is you want to look through the rubble and wait for the boss to open its mouth once the boss opens its mouth that's when you dodge all the while you want to be weaving in r1 attacks and if you get the boss stunned like this you want to keep hitting r1 on the way down and then once it's fully down and you have a little bit of stamina regenerated that's when you do the special l2 attack so you should be able to do this uh you know after a while you should be able to get him down with only two l2 attacks and then the boss should go down somehow i am just surviving on one hp here i think i got so frustrated with this boss by the time i got this far i was like you know what let's see if i can even make it to phase two so that move right there where the boss is just sort of wigging out and lava's flying all over the place for that you really just want to back up and let him do his thing but the boss has another move where he will uh throw fire at you that one you can just roll through the fire and you'll literally roll right into the boss and you can get a quick two r1s starting off phase two you just want to run a little far into the boss not too far and then immediately start your l2 the reason you don't want to go too far is because the lava surrounding the boss if that reaches you it will interrupt your cast of that second l2 and basically negate all the damage you would have done which was basically completely back loaded on that second l2 hit so this overhead slam here this is a little tricky what you want to do is when it's coming back at you you want to wait for the boss to slam the sword down it will always land next to you and then you want to roll it's a delayed hit the boss will always follow that up with a forward stab and then rip that out of the ground so you just want to be careful for that and then we can luckily get another full l2 attack here but on my next l2 you're going to notice that i get interrupted by lava very rarely in phase 2 will the serpent become active again it's a little difficult to tell when it's going to happen because the head literally just flips around within a few frames and then it's coming after you so unless you're at a decent distance it's hard to tell when it's happening you'll notice that while the boss is doing all this the boss is getting closer to me and so is the lava that's really tough to judge and when the sky turns red that means that skulls are going to soon start raining down from the sky if you see lava on the floor not surrounding the boss it's going to become a geyser right here tons of damage to me no bueno and these things just sort of happen in phase two once the boss puts his sword up the skulls are gonna come down i recommend just turning around and trying really hard to get your own bearings because this arena is very big because of all these pillars it's very easy to get stuck on the environment i cannot tell you how many times it happened to me i was getting stuck on the environment the boss was pixels in front of me and i couldn't do anything about it with these skulls they don't deal damage to you because they never actually touch you they're like proximity mines so when they get right next to you they will explode and the explosion is what deals the damage so don't feel like you need to roll away right away after you know they reach you wait an extra second and you can also just run around the room avoiding them if you have enough stamina phase two gets extremely chaotic like i said this took me a really long time to do about an hour and a half and for a storm ruler boss that is a long time i really hope that they sort of balance this out a little bit maybe in a future patch maybe just automatically get rid of those pillars in phase two make it a completely open arena i feel like that would help a whole lot but i hope this strategy has been helpful to you and i hope you get them down quicker than i did if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel

Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the ulcerated tree spirit in the fringe folk heroes grave little tip if you have come here just after starting your character and you selected your keepsake as a key leave it's not worth doing it's not worth killing yourself over and over and over to try doing just come back later the reward is not that serious okay this being a beast type boss the general strategy is to either stay near its stomach or attack its tail and if you ever get the opportunity for a clean head shot take it because it's gonna deal a lot of stagger damage okay if you are fighting the boss and standing near its stomach whenever it moves at a frame or begins to wiggle at a frame that is your cue to move you can generally just run out of the way and you'll be fine where you can roll once and you'll be okay if you do get hit by one of those moves it really should not one shot you so you just recover pretty easily however the gold explosion is a little difficult to avoid if you are fighting the boss near its stomach you can try to just run in the opposite direction but chances are the boss kind of has you cornered at all times because it is just so big good news you can stagger the boss and get a riposte so just keep wailing on it and eventually the boss will go down if you come here late in the game after you've done a couple of the major legacy dungeons you shouldn't really have any trouble and like i said the reward is not that serious so you really shouldn't waste time trying to do this at the start of the game it's really not worth it but that's it after a little while the boss goes down if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for eldon ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the knox swords and the knox priest these are pretty easy bosses to the point where i think it might have been bugged in my game or the ai needs to be retuned in a patch because these guys did barely anything to me and they stayed away from me most of the time like they were just backing up almost the entire time so if that's happening to you let me know if they're more aggressive for you please let me know as well i'm very curious these bosses are actually quite interesting and you see there the priest just transformed their weapon and now they have two spike shields that they just want to poke me to death with which is pretty interesting and eventually they will transform back into their mace which i guess also doubles as a flail of sorts but i dropped that one to about 20 hp and then it just started backing up so at no point were either of these bosses aggressive to me which meant that i could just press them over and over and over again so again let me know if you're experiencing the same thing because i felt it to be quite strange so with the priest down i'm literally just going to corner the sword stress she's not going to do much to me if anything at all and because she's so passive she literally puts herself in a corner she puts her own baby in a corner i don't know how to help that in any event you just whale on her i do believe she's parriable although i never tried but she's just using a pretty standard weapon setup although it is very creative and she goes down and for that you get the knocks flowing sword and don't forget to go under the throne for another treasure and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always also johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Beastman of Farum Azula (Throwing Knife & Greatsword) (Dragonbarrow Cave) - Narrated Boss Guide
Video ID: Y3GWVYgjoa4
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat a pair of bosses the beast men of faroom azula i could be butchering that i don't know one has a great sword and the other has throwing knives so the one with the throwing knives is the one that we're going to kill first and we're going to implement a fairly cheesy but very reliable strategy for these bosses and it allows you to really manage both of them at the same time without sacrificing a ton of health and keeping the fight from becoming very chaotic so starting off you want to crouch in the first bush until the boss turns and starts walking towards the back of the cave then you want to come up here get a backstab that will also aggro the other boss and then the general strategy that we're going to implement and then keep repeating over and over is we're going to target the throwing knife boss and then we're going to kite the great sword boss to the back of the cave and then we're just gonna run up to the throwing knife boss deal some damage and rinse and repeat that entire process so i'm literally going to do the same thing until this one dies so on this pass we're going to get it all lined up i'm going to go in for some extra damage really quick i'm going to say no thanks because i'm getting hit by sickles and then we're going to back up the great sword boss is going to come after us and notice that i hold my shield up the entire time you can roll through the flying knives however sometimes people throw a smaller second one which you can't really do anything about after you've blocked and put your shield down it hits you really fast so if you roll through the first one and the second one's coming chances are you're just gonna get hit by it but it really doesn't do that much damage so you saw there we kited the greatsword boss to the back of the cave and now we run up to the throwing knife boss and start chipping away at him and that's the whole strategy for the first part of the fight and then once this guy goes down we'll be able to focus on the greatsword boss one-on-one which we have technically already fought if you've been doing all the catacombs throughout the game you fight one of these in limb grave very early on so this should be a familiar fight to you at this point all right so unfortunately things got a little messed up here he threw a couple knives when i wasn't expecting so i gotta reset it one more time and then we'll go in i will start telling you now the strategy for the greatsword boss is basically a backstab fishing strategy we're just gonna fish for backstabs and the reason i implemented that strategy out of all strategies is for one simple reason i think i came to this area way too early i have since left and gone somewhere else but i think i came here so early because i did barely any damage to this boss even from backstabs so all we're going to do now is we're going to wait for one particular attack and that is the attack where the boss starts flipping out it's not this one he will usually back up and do it this one right here he has a big roar he starts slashing a whole bunch spins around does an uppercut and then a down slam as long as you are either on the very edge of that uppercut and you block it or you just roll through it you can roll through the overhead slam the jump attack and just walk up to him for a backstab we're gonna do that for the next several minutes and because that's all we're doing i'm gonna end the commentary so if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye-bye so you

Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the tibia mariner in lyria of the lakes this is on the east side of lyria kinda near the tower this tiny little area doesn't have its own name the tibia mariner if you've never fought one before it's basically a guy in a boat and he can summon various enemies depending on where you run into him in the world this guy can summon basically just a lesser undead when you're fighting these guys make sure that if you're not gonna completely ignore them that when you kill them you actually hit the white unholy goo that's coming out of them when they fall down otherwise they will just come back to life so you have to kill them permanently by hitting the ooze and then they will no longer resurrect but like i said the boss can just keep summoning them so if you want you can really just ignore them if they're not giving you too much trouble and then eventually once you you know drop the boss like 35 40 health he'll teleport out anyway and you got to go find him again and these undead zombie guys don't really like to run around very much so they kind of can be ignored if you really want to so like i said you dropped the boss's health bar a decent amount he teleports away and then the fight resets for the boss itself it only has a few attacks all of them having to do with the boat with the exception of one so whenever you know the boat's moving around then it looks like it's about to slam down just roll out of the way and you won't have to worry about it when the boss starts playing the vuvuzela and it's glow in red that means that it's going to summon enemies when it starts glowing white that's going to be a big aoe attack that you got to watch out for and other than that that's the whole fight for your trouble you get a death route be sure to speak with dee in the round table hold if you haven't already he'll tell you what to do with those and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter enjoy my discord the links for those are in the description below as always also johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Video ID: m71l6cKyKY8
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the clean rot knight in the still water cave for this fight i recommend running over to the platform or the sort of non-swamp area that the boss spawns on and fighting her here i think it's a her at least maybe not the reason for this is because the rest of the area is all poison and while you can cure poison pretty easily in this game you can craft items to do it or you can cast the incantation like i have on my bar it's just a waste of time and this boss really does not let up the main attacks that you got to watch out for are the gold spear as well as the ability that you did just before that where she scrapes the ground and gold spears come out of the ground i'll say right off the bat i came back to this boss a lot later because i was just getting destroyed the boss if she hits you with the gold spear attack the charging one this one right here if you get hit with that you're almost guaranteed to get instantaneous uh blood rot which deals a ton of damage and is a very strong poison and you do not yet have the cure for it at the stage of the game i still didn't but i figured i would do enough damage to where it probably wouldn't matter the easiest strategy i can recommend for this boss is to just wait for her to do that charging spear attack roll and get a backstab the recovery from it is a really really big one so you have plenty of time to get a backstab and it should deal a decent amount of damage but that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye bye you

Video ID: mNM-YEGpYQU
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the er tree burial watchdog and the cliff bottom catacombs this watchdog has three heads so it can deal a decent amount of fire damage if you're not careful and the added sort of perk to this fight or twist on this fight is that the boss can cast a spell and its ground pound ability also deals magic damage so you have to watch out for those the physical attacks are more or less the same i do want to remind you that when the boss is on its hind legs it can be very difficult to see what's going to happen but all you need to do is watch the boss's hands and as soon as his hands start moving towards you that's when you want to roll that high and leg attack when it's standing up on its two hind legs is i don't know it's almost instantaneous but you can react to it as long as you know what to look out for the boss can also summon blue glenstone orbs around it these are easy enough to avoid but while you are avoiding those the boss will generally prepare another attack so as you're backing away from them you want to just keep an eye out for the boss this way you don't get surprised by a slam or the boss flying around and getting ready to do a ground pound you don't want that to happen for the ground pound specifically you want to roll once you notice the boss beginning to move down all the physical attacks from this boss are quite fast especially the overhead slams so you got to be really careful with those the ground pounds are fast the physical attacks are fast the only thing that's really slow are these blue orbs because they have such a long tell that chances are you're gonna be able to dodge them every single time unless they spawn right underneath you that's pretty much it the boss will go down with one or two more attacks and i'm just trying to get greedy at this point i'm trying to end it i do like killing it in the air though because i find that death animation pretty funny where it literally just falls out of the sky like a statue you should but that's it for your trouble you get the caden cell sword ashes and you get to move on if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Dragonkin Soldier - Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: 2OeDaTBQxCg
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the dragonkin soldier boss in nakron eternal city you get here from shifa river but it is technically nakron if you die to this boss and you respawn it'll say knock kron eternal city but it doesn't actually announce itself when you teleport in i thought that was interesting anyway you teleport using a somewhat hidden portal so you want to start where i showed on the map and then head in this general direction and you will see a pillar that is crumbling and then there's an archer on top who has enchanted arrows that can blast you off of torrent real fast so you want to take care of him real quick or at least get him to stop using the bow and then you can run past him and then you'll find the teleporter up on this ledge here so once you take it you want to venture around this little open area and eventually you'll find the boss sleeping so when the boss wakes up it's just going to start pretty slow the boss doesn't get too aggressive until it's below half health so what we're doing is just doing damage while it wakes up on its legs and feet you're really never gonna attack the body if you notice it's missing guts and that kind of indicates that you can't even hit it there it's not really going to do anything which i found to be very interesting so the boss has a lot of slams like most giants do if you've fought a lot of the giants throughout limb grave chances are you're going to be somewhat familiar with this fight even before it starts and you may not even notice why but that's why it's so sort of the same move set so the boss can do a really big pound after it stands up and when it does that it's also going to follow it up by pulling its hand out of the ground and then what will happen after that is a big shockwave so it is two hits that you have to avoid it's not just the one but i actually discovered this boss pretty late so i'm doing pretty decent damage to it if you fight it early on when you first discover she for river you may need to come back for this or it'll just take a lot longer it's up to you there's really no harm in coming back for this boss the reward is not that serious it is guarding a talisman which is very useful but it's not like this is a mandatory story boss or anything that's the shock wave i was mentioning before you saw it actually buries its hand in the ground and then that indicates that it's going to pull it back out with the shock wave whenever the boss roars on all fours that rhymed he is going to run away and then he will usually stand up and turn around and then slam back down and then it's easy enough to avoid you really just have to roll right before the boss slams and you'll avoid all the damage if you roll too early while you get up you may get hit by the shock wave of the slam that is really easy to forget that's happened to me many many times but in the end it's really just a giant fight it looks really cool and has great music but it's really just a giant fight and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Margit, the Fell Omen + Secret Phase 1 Strategy - Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: Id-GwfWg1d0
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down margat the fel omen for this fight you can summon sorcerer roger if you like however i did not do so there is a very special item available in the full version of this game called margaret's shackle you can purchase this from patches if you found him in the murk water cave right after aggiel's area so if you haven't found that i'm going gonna show you what to do with it but you can go back and get it so in phase one if you're close to market you can stand right next to them and then use market shackle and this only works in phase one it's kinda similar to uh the music box in bloodborne similar vibes except it can't be used in phase two only phase one but it will bind market to the ground and you can just get tons of free damage on them and you can use it repeatedly if you like but again it only works in phase one this boss is parriable however it does take two parries in order to successfully stagger him completely for a riposte the first time you parry him you're probably only gonna be able to get one or two hits on him but the second time as long as you do it within a decent amount of time of the first you will be able to riposte him no problem so i use the shackle a bit too early there and it only works if you're standing really close to him so it's a risky item to use but he has a bunch of abilities that just leave him open for tons of damage so you can do that i'm not sure if when you're hitting him like this if you will be building stagger damage as well i kind of can't imagine that you would that'd be really cheap but once margie gets down to about 60 health the music will turn up to 15 and then he will start attacking significantly more aggressively and the big thing he gets literally is this hammer so he has several moves with the hammer however most of them also involve his staff so you gotta still watch out for the staff and he has tons of combos that can be very deadly with this big up sweep or up swing he will always slam it down after so i recommend just sort of tracking him to the side and then once he slams it down just roll and get a bunch of damage in pretty much every single move in this phase though has some sort of follow-up with a golden weapon whether it be the hammer the sword or the daggers and in my opinion they've toned it down since the closed network test but he kind of cheats in that once you press square he's coming after you like once you use an item or once you try to heal he's he's becoming way more aggressive it is toned down since the closed network test but we really did feel like he was cheating during that time so you saw there he just threw one dagger and then came after you he's a little tough to predict here in phase two but the big thing is that you want to do your best to have a little bit of distance between you and the boss this way you can at least react to things i know it's easier said than done but the whole like thing about phase two is that he's trying to overwhelm you as quickly as he possibly can so having a little bit of distance baiting out the hammer or not the hammer the staff attacks uh is really the way to go and he has a couple moves in this fight that you can actually just completely bait out and parry when he tries to close the distance on you and fly towards you you can block that first hit parry the second one this one right here you just block that and then attempt to parry the second one because he only had a little bit of health i just went in for the kill but that is the best move to attempt to uh to parry him on but after several attempts myself included he will go down you will get a talisman pouch uh for your troubles this allows you to equip another talisman which is very very helpful that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Starscourge Radahn - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: cEEQSjeZdo4
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down star scourge radon this is a really interesting boss fight and in the comments i would love it if you'd let me know what you think of this fight so starting off you'll notice a bunch of gold summon signs on the ground you want to summon everyone you see basically you're creating an army to fight radon here and what's pretty cool is that when these npcs ultimately die you can re-summon them eventually starting off here in this little area you want to stay on the back side of this dune because once you go past it anywhere near this summon sign or on that parallel line radon will start firing a volley of arrows that are more difficult to avoid so we're going to summon patches here but i realized as soon as i summoned him that he's probably getting arrows reigned down on him when he was coming up and he dies really fast patches will always die super quick that said i'm not sure if patches will always appear here unless he's friendly to you i could be wrong on that i have blithe and alexander and patches as far as npcs that i know um everybody else just seems to be random but maybe you meet them in later parts of the game i'm not exactly sure all right so once you have radon kind of in your sights there are a few attacks that you want to watch out for mostly his gravity attacks they're all pretty much delayed hits and you can roll through just about all of them really not that big of a deal but when he starts moving around on his horse all willy nilly that's when things get extremely chaotic and it's at this point that if he's not close to half health i recommend running away and letting your teammates fight for you for a little bit and then if a bunch of them die i recommend running around and re-summoning them you can stagger him as you see here however you only have a couple seconds to get to his head and get the riposte he does recover from that very very quickly once the boss goes below 50 health he will jump out and then you will notice an orange glow in the sky and that's because he's coming back as a fireball very reminiscent of the night jar enemy in oshana castle in sakura so in phase two he moves a lot faster primarily only uses gravity attacks and if a lot of folks died during phase one all of their summon signs should be available again so what you need to do is you just need to mount up on torrent and roll around the desert for a second and you can summon folks while on torrent in this fight so all you gotta do is ride past them and press triangle the main attack that you gotta watch out for in phase two is these meteors that are around him eventually radon will run away and he completely like detaches aggro from everybody he technically still has it on one person it could be you it could be an npc but he will eventually run away and when he does that the meteors will detach from him and start flying into whoever he has aggro on like i said they could be you that could be somebody else this is it right here so luckily the aggro was on blithe so i didn't have to deal with it but they move a lot faster than you might suspect so you have to be very careful when dodging them and you need to dodge twice you can just roll to the side both times and that should do it the other big ability that you gotta watch out for in phase two is that one right there they are a series of gravity orbs and if all of them hit basically if one hits you they're all going to hit you and when that happens it's going to completely drain your stamina if you're blocking if you're not blocking it'll likely kill you if it drains your stamina you're going to get hit by his follow-up attack most likely so getting hit by one of those gravity orbs is almost certain death you can see here that i'm just rolling around the desert trying to find summon signs that might have come back up because i don't want to fight him one on one this really is a team based fight it's kind of something to get used to because it's very new to a game like this like deliberate summons that you really should be using all the time like this so it takes a little while to get used to once you do you'll start to get comfortable and understand that you are not in charge of this fight radan is in charge of this fight and you just need to overwhelm him with your army that's kind of the idea here while fighting him you want to do your best to stay behind him and let your friends take charge and take aggro it's easier said than done but that's really the kind of strategy that you want to employ don't attack him until your army has aggro and that's it eventually he will go down there is one ability that he uses that i didn't get to showcase here he basically flies up and spins in a spiral and flies toward you you can dodge it but be sure to dodge the follow-up attack it's the same thing that comes immediately after that's it that is star scourge radon if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for eldon ring

hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the putrid avatar guarding the minor herb tree in grails dragon barrow this is your standard er tree avatar fight however this one can inflict scarlet rot and in a hurry so you need to pay very close attention to its ground pound ability this one right here and when it's doing that instead of doing your typical roll into it and deal damage you instead want to very deliberately and very quickly run away luckily you have a really big arena here next to the earth tree however there are quite a lot of pots so it's easy to get stuck on things but as long as you're aware of your surroundings you just want to run away from that scarlet rot this red cloud and then just whittle down the boss's health all the other abilities are the same and luckily the starfall ability does not also inflict scarlet rot i feel like that'd be pretty mean but it's just the ground pound that you now have to run away from instead of running into to get some follow-up damage that's pretty much it that's the whole strategy so like i said you have a really big arena but you are on a cliff so you want to make sure you don't run off of the cliff i know that's kind of silly to even say but it's happened to me you wouldn't believe how many times it's happened to me i'm not sure if it's because this boss's ground pound ability does so much more deadly type of damage than other urge tree avatars but it seems like the putrid avatar does the ground pound way more often than any of the others and so this one takes a little while to whittle down but again as long as you're just looking out for the scarlet rot cloud you should be okay there aren't any ads in the area but you don't want to stray too too far otherwise you know some dragons do wander in this area and you know unless you've just sort of been playing and not actually resting in any points of grace for an extended period of time uh the chances of you running into one are pretty low but just something to keep in mind so here's that starfall ability i mentioned there are quite a lot of stars with this featured avatar so you gotta run for a while once you do that you can just head back in do some follow-up damage it still has its right foot stomp like it's doing the cha-cha slide that's pretty much it so it's the same strategy as all the others i don't really have much else to say just avoid the scroller rot and you're good to go all right i'll end the commentary here let it play out good luck you'll get a couple tears for your troubles and some souls or some runes and then you get to move on all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord links for those are in the descriptions below as always i'll see johnny cage thank you so much for watching and we'll see you next time bye [Music] you

Title: Ulcerated Tree Spirit (Mt. Gelmir) - Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: S-fS0AWliX4
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the ulcerated tree spirit guarding the minor earth tree in mount gelmere this ulcerated tree spirit might be the most difficult one of all because you're fighting it on a slope and fighting things on slopes in these sorts of games is very difficult to do the boss moves erratically sometimes its hitbox is not actually present on the ground you can't even see the thing and then it still just ends up hitting you so the fight is the same if you've fought other ulcerated tree spirits this one doesn't do anything new however the explosive damage that it can do is quite deadly because there is a lot of debris on the ground preventing you from running away as quickly as you might like one of the major abilities you got to watch out for from the boss is that head slam that i just got rocked by that's really hard to tell when it's about to happen because of the way the camera works in this game the boss is huge it's slithering around and especially because you're on a slope you can't always see the boss's head so there's not a huge tail on its body when it's going to happen but you got to do your best to hold up your shield if you feel like the boss is about to attack just kind of use your spidey sense to tell one of the other moves you gotta look out for is that big flying move right there it's easy enough to avoid because the boss is in the air and very clearly gonna come after you but it can take you by surprise sometimes because it also looks like the ability where the boss just sort of wiggles around a bunch and just does a bunch of whipping attacks but that one he starts flying in the air for some reason so the boss can explode at about 50 hp once it gets around there and you will notice if you're far enough away that the explosions are not one giant aoe they're little geysers of gold fire that come out of the ground which if you're far enough away you're able to see that and then you can dodge appropriately or you can just be far enough away to where you don't even need to dodge at all you're just far away when the boss is below 50 hp it will mostly be on fire the fire doesn't necessarily deal additional damage to you but it will start using more and more attacks that utilize that fire so it can explode every once in a while it can breathe fire on you and then it can follow up some abilities with fire breathing so you gotta be very very careful i don't recommend going for attacks on the boss's head at this point of the fight because chances are it's going to hit you and then follow up with fire and you're just going to cook to death and it's not going to be a good time you have to redo this another ability to be on the lookout for is that hand slam i've noticed that when you are sort of smack center in the boss's belly it doesn't really use that but if you're ever too far off to the side it will start slamming its hands when the boss is wiggling around the move that will actually deal damage to you typically doesn't come until pretty late and it's almost always in the form of a tail swipe or something to do with the hands so when it's rolling around you don't want to in turn to start spam rolling that's not going to help you you want to try to delay your roll until near the end and then actually roll through an attack rather than just panic rolling so this is another explosion you can see the geysers on the ground the boss does have its own aoes you definitely don't want to be standing near it when it's exploding otherwise you're gonna have a pretty bad time this boss can be staggered however because of the wide open area of the arena chances are you're not gonna be able to deal enough consistent damage to make it happen unless you're using some sort of big two-handed weapon or possibly some major spells but it can be done and then you can get a free visceral which deals quite a lot of damage to the boss so that's kind of the general strategy when you are close to it i recommend keeping your finger pretty close to the shield button if you are a shield user because this way you will be able to block very quickly if you need to the boss can move very very fast but that's it once the boss goes down you get your runes you'll get a couple tears only 18 000 runes for this boss i thought that was quite low especially for this area but it is what it is if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides

Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down red wolf of the champion chances are if you're here in mount gelmere you've done the academy of ray lucario already and you've seen a boss quite similar to this one i am using a different build from that video however i have respect into a primarily strength build instead of a mix of strength and decks so i'm using a big two-handed weapon and the strategy is going to be a tiny bit different so hopefully that helps the boss has all the same moves it can put out some glintstone homing swords on you those can be quite annoying just be sure to block those attempt to roll through them if you can you do have enough space in the arena to run in a line to avoid them however the boss is very fast and very aggressive so you may not be able to dodge all of it plus the boss when the boss gets the orange sword in its mouth or i guess a red sword it will swipe twice there is a chance that it can swipe a third time with a downward strike that one is easy enough to avoid it's very obvious it's going to happen the boss is going to jump up in the air but it doesn't always happen the other ability that it can do with the sword is a big sweep strike that hits twice so either roll away and just hold up your shield in case you don't get far enough away or just roll into it and counter attack if you're using a big sword like i am you want to only attack the boss once maybe twice if you get it in a full recovery stance meaning after a big slam it'll take a little while longer to recover than other moves but you really don't want to do any follow-up attacks here if you have a big enough sword you're going to do enough damage to where it's not going to matter but that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Erdtree Avatar (Caelid) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: 6G4EVm3scRo
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the er tree avatar in caled this er tree avatar is actually quite difficult compared to the others that's because he can inflict scarlet rot on you very quickly if you're not careful so every time it does a ground pound a big cloud of scarlet rod poison will come out of it and then it will stay on the ground for a few seconds so as long as you see that smoke coming off the ground that means that the scarlet rock puddle there is still active and it can still inflict poison on you and this stuff builds super fast and deals a ton of damage while it's happening the way around this mechanic of the new and improved ground pound is to just run away from the boss while it's doing a ground pound instead of rolling into it like we normally do to get some extra damage on him just ignore that damage opportunity because it's really an opportunity for him to deal a ton of damage to you other than that the fight is the exact same as they always are for the starfall ability you just want to pick a direction and run in it no change there one of the tricky things about this particular archery avatar fight is that you're fighting it on the side of a cliff and that can be quite challenging the other thing is that there's a lot of pots around as there usually are in these archery scenarios but with the pots come a lot of terrain to get stuck on so you do need to be careful about that i did get stuck a couple times and took a death because of it but there's a stake of america right in front of this boss so you don't have to travel very far if you do die but just avoid the scarlet rot and you will be successful and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Video ID: Cf8YGVYHOLs
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the ur tree burial watch dogs in the er tree catacombs in caled this is a pretty challenging fight it's a 2v1 and these watchdog bosses can be kind of tricky on their own but with two of them it just gets really really tough so the challenge here is the speed at which they attack they are very deliberate like they're not very smooth or anything but because their attacks come out so quickly you need to do your best to focus on one boss at a time if they're both vulnerable at the same time great by all means take a big swing at them and get damage on both but otherwise you really really just want to focus on one as best you can and if you notice that they're flying around together if they're not going to drop together it's really not a good idea to try to you know roll into one get a hit and then roll that before the second one drops not a good idea the other thing i want to mention is when they're standing on their hind legs that is a big challenge because what you need to do is you need to pay close attention to their hands and as soon as the hand moves to go down that's when you want to roll and doing that when there's two of them right in front of you is pretty difficult especially when one is going to slam right after the other it's almost like an unavoidable set of damage like you saw right there so you got to be careful with that but once one goes down it becomes a lot more manageable it's a fight you've done a ton of times at this point as long as you've been sort of following along like a burial tree watchdog should not be new to you at this point so once you get one on its own you should be home free just don't get greedy with your hits and you should be fine as you can see i got greedy and almost died and that's that's what these games do to you they punish your greed and they really really make you pay for it but we'll get the last hit in here in a second and then this will go down and then we can move on with the rest of caleb all right that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down decaying ex-ikes this boss is a decaying dragon that can inflict scarlet rot very quickly as any boss that has that capability can do the abilities are basically the same as most other dragons that you'll encounter in this game so a tail swipe a tail stomp if you're behind him for too long a stopped forward breath that just sort of sweeps side to side however it's not a fire breath it's scarlet rot so the thing to be careful of is getting too close to his head while he's doing that chances are if he is doing that side to side breath you can stand next to his head and be just fine however i recommend either standing closer to his neck or just going for the feet i wouldn't worry too much about trying to get a critical on this boss and trying to stagger him to get her a past it's really not worth it because the most damage can come out of this guy's mouth that's really what you got to keep in mind he does also have a move where he will breathe scarlet rot and then it will fill the entire area and it's almost impossible to avoid getting hit by it it's it's really really difficult it's this cloud right here you can see i'm totally far away from him granted when i first started getting hit i was very close to him but i basically ran out as soon as the meter started building and i still got completely inflicted so in this area of caleb you can pick up a couple berries that will get rid of scarlet rod however i don't like to use them or rely on them because i won't always have them there are a few laying around i just haven't found the recipe to heal them myself yet so other than that the boss is basically the same as other dragons it's just that scarlet rot improved feature that you gotta watch out for the scarlet rock can also come off of his stomps so you really can't stay near his feet for too long i'm surprised it doesn't come out of his tail swipe all things considered when the boss flies up but flies very low it's going to slam down so you just watch out for that nothing to really worry about too much it still has a sort of mouth snap that's something to look out for and then of course any sort of breath from this boss will be scarlet rot like i said i don't really have any other comments this is a boss that i did pretty late i came back to this boss after running past it the first time i was in caled and then came back after doing a bunch of other stuff so i'll let the video play out but i have no other tips just avoid that breath at all costs and keep your health up it's really easy to lose track of your health with scarlet rock but it drops pretty quick especially compared to like a slow poison that's it good luck if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Perfumer Tricia & Misbegotten Warrior (Unsightly Catacombs) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring
Video ID: 1PufBgzPafA
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down perfumer trisha and the misbegotten warrior in the unsightly catacombs this is obviously a 2v1 fight so you're in for a treat for some reason the perfumer did not activate its ai when i entered the room and i wish i had to realize that because i probably could have made this a whole lot easier on myself by exploiting that fact you have a choice of which boss you'd like to take down first you can of course split your time between them but it's just an inefficient way of going about it in my opinion what i did was i kept the misbegotten warrior around the perimeter of the room while trisha stayed in the middle mostly out of my reach and out of my concern for the most part it was very rare that her explosions got anywhere near me occasionally she can put a shield around the misbegotten warrior however this shield will only negate damage it will not negate the stamina the damage or stagger that you can deal to an enemy so keep that in mind it's like you should it's not like you should wait for this shield to go away it actually won't at any time i don't think i'm pretty sure you have to hit it off of the boss but just still go for it don't let it interrupt your strategy at all just think of it as an extra hit you've got to put on the boss i'm using a big heavy two-handed sword here so i'm able to stagger the boss pretty easily if you're using a one-handed weapon or if you're using magic or something chances are this may be a bit harder for you to deal with but the general strategy of keeping trisha in the middle is what i recommend employing regardless of your setup one thing that you gotta look out for is that the perfume explodes late that's really really hard to remember for me is that when it's up in the air that's fine it's when it explodes it deals damage that's really hard for me to remember for some reason but once you get in on trisha she's pretty much dead in one hit she has a very little health and a backstab from this grafted blade great sword plus nine it one shots her so once you get in on her she's fine but doing so while the misbegotten warrior is alive and just flipping out around the room is quite a difficult task so that's why i recommend doing that strategy and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Elemer of the Briar (The Shaded Castle) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: X5OBqw8TnhA
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down elemer of the briar this is a pretty difficult boss i switched back to using a one-handed sword and shield as opposed to my giant two-handed sword that i've been using for the past several hours while playing reason being that this boss does not stagger easily by any means and he can attack very quickly so unless you yourself have armor with high poise or you just have a high poise rating for whatever reason using heavy weapons is really not the move for this guy i you want to be nimble i can't recommend that enough alright so this guy has a blade that he can throw around sort of like a weapon from symphony of the night if you ever played that very similar vibes when the weapon glows red it doesn't always necessarily mean that he's going to throw it but it does mean that he's going to be doing some extra damage with it at the very least so he can be buried as you saw there however i don't believe you can parry the red sword moves i believe it just has to be the regular sword he will shield bash somewhat often during this fight and there is about a 50 chance that with that shield bash he can also enhance the shield and do a really big second shock wave so you have to be on the lookout for that i don't recommend going in too hard on him this is why during a shield bash because he could just very easily uh do a second shockwave pretty quick if you notice that he puts his shoulder towards you and is not attacking for a half a second that means that he's going to do a shield dash you can avoid it pretty easily you could roll into him roll away whatever you want to do but that will deal a lot of damage and also stagger you a good deal so after that shield bash for whatever reason he decided not to do an enhanced one and he does take an extra second to put the shield back on his back that's when you can go in and get a couple hits in if you like like i said he can be parried however he does require two parries in order to get one repast so i'm not exactly sure the exact reason for that he must just have a really high uh posture meter okay so you saw there he has a grab it's like a dark hand from dark souls 1 on steroids it doesn't de-level you or steal humanity or anything but it does deal a ton of damage it is easily avoided but because he sticks his hand out for so long it kind of induces like a panic roll in me a lot of the time i get hit by it like 40 percent of the time i would say so yeah something to watch out for is that grab and again that enhanced shield bash with the second shock wave when he gets ready to end his combo with a forward stab you could literally just walk to his right and it will go right past you for your troubles you get the mirai executioner's sword and that is one of the legendary weapons all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Full-Grown Falling Starbeast (Mt. Gelmir) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: zlH3QE8XbAM
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the full-grown falling star beast of mount gilmere this boss can be found at the very top of mount gelmere so just keep climbing up and up and up until you find this wind shaft you can also take the ladder if you like um i will say this boss i'm not a big fan of it's to the point where i feel like maybe i missed something and you're supposed to kill it with a special item or something similar to how market has a secret phase one item that kind of helps out because this boss took almost nine minutes to kill and well over an hour and a half of attempts and at no point did i feel like i was doing anywhere close to enough damage however by this point of the game i had already finished mount gelmere i had finished volcano manor i was just going back through and making sure i didn't miss anything but in any event the boss has a wide range of attacks most of them having to do with its body however when it reaches about 50 health the boss will start employing gravity magic to great effect so that's when things get very interesting and very frustrating for me so when you notice any purple glowing happening to the boss gravity magic is coming when the boss jumps up and starts balling up in the air that is your cue to get closer to the boss and then roll into it as it's flying back towards you if you are not close enough to when the boss falls you will take a damage even if you roll because the boss is going to roll into you so you have to be careful with that the boss can swipe its head around it can do that up to three times with the third or any of the final ones being a rock throw so you saw there was pretty close to the boss but i was just just far enough away to where the roll after his jump got me sometimes the boss can summon gravity spikes through himself and if you are caught you know under the boss it's difficult to get out of that without taking damage when the boss starts doing a bull rush it'll generally do it three times although it can cut it short so you gotta be on the lookout for that but when the bull rush ends in phase one it will do a rock throw so if you chased it down just be careful because you can end up getting hit by those rocks you have to be careful in phase two that actually is a really good opportunity to deal a lot of damage to the boss so if you're far enough away from that jump roll you can actually roll to the side and you should be able to avoid the damage but i have gotten hit by it because it's not a very clean roll that the boss does he sort of like lumbers to the side of it so it's hard to get that clean the tail attacks are surprisingly difficult to avoid sometimes because it is a delayed attack and the tail appears to grow out of the boss whenever it's about to use it so it gets very long and anticipating when that growth is going to stop can be quite difficult the rock throw is another thing that i found kind of frustrating i felt like there were times where i rolled through it but i would still get hit on the tail end by something and just take full damage anyway so you really got to be careful when the boss starts clicking its pincers and glowing purple you will notice some purple electricity at your feet when that happens you want to roll because the spike is going to come up and then after the third one usually but he can cut it short after that third one a big gravity field is going to appear around you and then you need to run out of it and uh avoid it but sometimes you can't get out of it quick enough however you can roll through the gravity spikes that come up it's just very difficult so you saw when phase two began the boss had this big doctor strange moment from end game where he lifts all the rocks up and then slams them back down so that's an interesting one to avoid it's not too bad but i don't recommend attempting to deal damage to the boss while it's going on because you will get picked up as well that ability saw there where it shoots those beams it will generally do that after a phase a three wave bull rush in phase two so when it's doing the ball russian phase two you wanna keep a very close eye on the boss and as soon as you see it's starting to charge purple you wanna run into the boss run to its right side your left and then you can get a bunch of hits in it's sort of like what you do against dragons in this game when they're doing their horizontal side to side breath same general strategy so you can see here the boss does the big gravity slam thing and the way you know that you are out of range of it is that you start to see like the mirror dimension around you so that's how you kind of know but you see there i did the three wave there and got through the big gravity field when that's happening you just want to do your best to look for where the animation ends of the purple electricity and if you can just get just beyond that and you should be safe but i always recommend rolling out of it at the very end just in case because it's not exactly a one-to-one representation of where the ground spikes are gonna swell from so you gotta be careful right there i think that's the craziest most accurate hitbox of elden ring i've ever seen i do remember thinking hey i rolled through that and for some reason i didn't i must not have hit the button or maybe the input got eaten because i hit something else but when the boss's leg splatted to either side i mean i didn't get hit i was amazed at how good it looked and from software is very much known for their really good hit boxes okay so those are basically all the abilities of the fight so we're gonna do a three wave bull rush however if you do get hit by it chances are the boss will not use its uh big electricity so you do you have to be careful for that while this is going on you want to stay on the outside of it because the rocks when they slam down will deal a bunch of damage the boss also has a grab that has a very similar tell to this three wave shock wave here when the boss starts cocking its head to the side and clicking its pincers repeatedly it's going to do a grab and this grab is very devastating it can and it can actually end up throwing you off the mountain if you are far enough you'll notice that i'm fighting the boss on the outer ring of this what i'm assuming is a crash star i don't really know um that is for a very specific reason the terrain in this little area here is very consistent there's not a lot of jagged rocks to get stuck on as you can see just behind the boss there are hard rocks just jutting out of the surface you can very easily get stuck on those and you can't exactly roll through them to avoid attacks but in this area here with this little grass patch this is where i like to keep the boss because the terrain is consistent if you were to fight him in the middle it's very rocky it's very uneven and you can't always tell what's going on and the boss can get a lot of elevation on you if you're not careful so that's why i fight him over here really really recommend you keep him in this general area so somehow we just made it out of that mirror dimension there and we were able to run in and try to get some damage but at this point i had made so many attempts that i'm just trying to be as safe as possible and really only dealing damage when i feel absolutely comfortable so you see there that tail swipe it just always takes me by surprise i think it's the ability that i get hit by the most and it's just a little frustrating right there the rock toss deals a ton of damage i feel like once i got the boss down to 15 i kind of forgot how to play for a minute and things just weren't going that well um i was starting to get a little frustrated i can't lie here but we'll get back on track here so we got another three wave shock wave here and you'll notice that as soon as that third one starts i'm trying to look for where the electricity ends but it's a little tough sometimes so don't feel bad if you get caught up in it just regroup and you'll be okay so the boss still has its front slam and it's backslam it just doesn't use them very often especially because i'm trying to bait out the bull rush ability at this point because that is the biggest opportunity for me to deal damage to the boss all right so we're gonna get another couple of hits in i do wanna also mention real quick the boss's head is its weak point you can deal basically double damage if you can hit it in the white part of its head but the opportunities to do that are so few and far between that i never really make it happen that move right there where it clicked its pincers and then rushed towards me that is the grab that's the one you got to look out for but after a while this boss will go down i am very curious if anybody has found an easier strategy or a way to deal extra damage to the boss because i have a plus nine legendary weapon it's a full strength faith build and i was just chipping away at that boss for nine minutes so let me know but if you have any questions about my strategy please leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted with new guides go live if you're

Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the magma worm in the gale tunnel chances are you have fought at least one of these before if not two when you went to volcano manor but the twist on this one is that the arena that you're fighting it in is very small compared to the first place that you fought it in the ruined strewn precipice so for this fight you really just want to try to stay under the boss's belly that's where you can do the most damage however you can attempt to stay by its feet but as you can see here it tends to spit lava to the sides so that's why the feet you know they may seem safer but ultimately they kind of aren't this move right here where the boss just walks around spewing lava this is where the arena comes into play because it's round the boss can literally just follow the wall and just automatically get turned and it's just always tracking you so it's really important that you do your best to try to stay behind the boss while it's moving however you got to be very careful because by staying behind it you may run into lava because it's always turning so don't try to chase it down too much you know don't kill yourself over it you know just wait for the boss to reset and just chip away some damage a little bit at a time that's one way to go about it the boss can also very easily throw you into walls and then follow up by breathing fire onto you so you gotta watch out for that but that's it after a little while the magma worm will go down you'll get the moonveil katana as well as a dragon heart so be sure to check out the church of dragon communion back in limbrave to see what's new all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Putrid Crystalian Trio (Sellia Hideaway) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]

Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the putrid crystalline trio in celia hideaway first i'll show you where this place is because it's very hidden once you get access to the celia backstreets you want to go to this location and again this is in caled you'll see this very peculiar looking gravestone that's guarded by a very strong battle mage but just behind the gravestone will be a cliff face the wall is illusory you want to hit it to reveal the cave and at the end are the bosses i'm gonna be very honest with you i don't enjoy this boss encounter i find these bosses to be incredibly annoying and having all three of them attacking you at the same time all building scarlet rot is just incredibly frustrating so with the three crystallines you have one with a staff casting all manner of spells and these spells increase your scarlet rot meter considerably very quickly each attack that you get peppered with will increase the meter then you have one with a ring blade that one's not too difficult to worry about she mostly stays to herself but she does throw tiny little ring blades which are very hard to see so just keep that in mind the spear one is really like the gang leader of this whole trio that's the one that's going to be patrolling the arena keeping you off of the other two so the general strategy that i employed throughout this encounter was to attempt to kite the spear boss to one end of the room and then rush the staff boss down since these are crystalline enemies they will not take damage until you crack their outer shell with my weapon it took five full hits on each boss to crack their shells but once you have the shells cracked then you can pretty much just zerg the boss and kill it very quickly but you will need to keep the same strategy going where you are kiting the spear boss out and then going in for the kill on the staff one one thing i do want to mention is that i do employ preserving boluses in this fight which are the pale red or pink berries that you can pick up that will staunch the scarlet rot and drop it off however i do not know where the recipe to make these are i only have whatever i've picked up in my adventures throughout caleb so if you don't have any you've got to make sure you're being extra careful throughout this fight to make sure that you are either just managing the scarlet roth damage and healing up consistently throughout the fight or doing your best to just completely not have it happen but once you get rid of the caster the rest of the fight basically becomes trivial i did notice however that once the caster went down the ring blade boss started becoming a lot more active i'm not sure if that's just because i started standing more closely to her but that's just what i've noticed and again after five hits of my weapon the boss gets stunned and then you can go in for a riposte and then the fight is basically over once this happens when their outer shells cracked they basically lose all poise so you can just go in on them until they drop and then once they do the fight is over i will say i came back to this boss after a while because i was getting so frustrated and i felt like i needed higher damage faster even though the weapon is quite slow once i started using a great sword and the grafted blade greatsword i had a much easier time whittling down their health but this is a very annoying fight if you're using a one-handed weapon you may notice that your attacks are just bouncing off the bosses if this is happening two-hand your weapon and then that won't happen but that does sacrifice your shield of course so it's a pretty tough fight you do get an interesting sorcery so if you're a magic user maybe this is worth it for you but in any event that's how you kill them that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the link for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down necromancer garrus in sage's cave so this is a pretty easy boss fight however he can get a little tricky because he summons adds throughout the fight and if you were wondering where the bonewheel skeletons were in this game i'm pretty sure this is supposed to be them so the boss can summon these weird little skull things they kind of come out of nowhere and while you're trying to deal with those he is quite fast has a flail that can deal a lot of damage from a decent distance and then you have to kill these skulls luckily however they do not revive they're just regular enemies they don't have that white unholy goo coming out of him when you strike them down however he will bring in more and while that's happening both he and the skulls can summon skulls themselves so if you've seen that skull necromancy that he actually just casted before these rolling around skulls can do the same thing so you just want to manage the adds make sure the fight doesn't go on too long and so you don't get overwhelmed and then it should be fine for your troubles you will get the family heads weapon and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Video ID: n1SAxx4d358
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down commander o'neal in the swamp of aeonia this boss is pretty interesting from the start he will summon a few archers that can also transform into regular swordsmen so for these you just want to rush them down as quickly as possible because the boss can do a couple of things to them he can do one of two buffs if not both and you will see them throughout this fight the first buff that he can do is a defense buff this gives the archers and swordsmen white auras and then the other buff he can do is an attack power buff and that one is red so while he's doing those you can usually hear him sort of chanting a rallying cry he is the standard bearer of course this is the ability you really gotta watch out for when you notice mist swirling around the boss you want to run very far away because you do not want to get hit with the blood rot if you get hit with that you're going to be spending all of your time healing and just waiting for it to fall off unless you're able to cure it which at this point in the game you're probably not the boss is incredibly susceptible to parries his attacks are quite slow and you can really just chain them together over and over and over i am someone who i don't feel like i'm that great at pairing an elden ring it's hard for me to get the timing down but for whatever reason i'm able to do it against him no problem the stake of america for this fight is literally right in front of him so you can try this fight for a while until you get decent a pairing otherwise all you got to do is just roll through these attacks they are quite slow once the boss reaches 50 hp if you don't have him in a parry chain like i did uh he will summon these big axe wielding knights here you'll only summon three this is the attack power buff and look at that 75 of my health gone in two hits so that's the attack power buff and now they have shields so this is the double buffed uh phase of the fight if you will he doesn't buff himself which is nice it's only the adds it's only the spirits so just take those down and if you notice you're getting ganged up on just run away and those enemies will follow you the boss doesn't run he will just be walking around so you should always be able to separate the boss from the ads at least in my experience so again whenever you see the red mist just get away this way you don't have to deal with it otherwise you're just going to be burning through flasks trying to manage it the boss will only summon two waves of adds so once those go down you're home free and that's it if you are on the quest for this area you will get the unalloyed gold needle pretty sure you should get it even if you're not on the quest but bring that to an npc nearby and you can continue that questline and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guys for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the mimic tier in nakron eternal city the mimic tier is going to be a different fight for you as it is for me as it is for anybody else because the boss mimics you with your build one thing i would love for somebody to let me know is what happens if you come in here with a different weapon equipped and then change it out mid fight does the boss also change its weapon or if you have a different weapon and the right hand that you just click to will the boss also click to it like does it have your full loadout when it spawns i would love to know so the fight is gonna differ for me for you um it i will say the boss doesn't fight that intelligently given that i have this giant weapon it never attempts to parry me which i would have liked to have seen i mean npc invaders parries in time so i would have liked to have seen that but in any event the boss can flask one time you won't have to worry about it trying to outlast you or anything it can only heal once and it will try to heal but then realizes that the flasks are empty so you can actually run in and sort of exploit that whenever you see the boss attempting to heal the damage output is basically the same as yours so all you really have to do in this fight is be faster that's really the only trick the boss can do jump attacks as you just saw however i never used them so i kind of knew to just roll under it or just wait but that's it that's the mimic tier i would love to know how your fights go if the bosses have any cool special abilities when using spells or if anything unique happens for you let me know if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guys for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'm sweet johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Regal Ancestor Spirit (Nokron, Eternal City) - Full Narrated Access & Boss Guide - Elden Ring
Video ID: kNbsFunlCmc
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the regal ancestral spirit in nakron eternal city much like its predecessor in the schieffer river the ancestral spirit you need to light a set of braziers in the area in order to access the boss however up here in nakren you only need to activate six instead of eight and they're much less guarded than the other ones were so this is a bit of an easier time lighting these but the boss is more difficult to trade off so there you go all right so i'll show you how to light all six and where they are and then we'll get to the boss we're going to start from the bridge just after the mimic tier boss fight the first brazier is right here so go ahead and light that then we're going to turn into the woods very briefly cut through here everything is dead by the way i've killed all the enemies in the area so i'm not going to get in trouble here this is number two and then from here we're gonna turn around and then we're gonna go past the hallowhorn grounds turn back onto the main road and then number three is up on this little hill cliff right here you will need to ride up or jump up and go around and this will be pretty heavily guarded so be careful so that's three and then number four is going to be behind this tree all the way in the back this will be guarded by a red fox enemy you should be somewhat familiar with them by now but just be careful it doesn't actually patrol back here so you could light this and get away really easily so that's number four number five is going to be in this back corner here that'll be somewhat guarded as well and then number six is right next to the hunting grounds so you won't have to go very far to get the boss after you light it this one is probably the most guarded there's like four enemies here so this is number six and then you can just run on over to the hunting grounds and do the same thing you did before just go ahead and touch the remains and then you will be transported to the boss room so this is again a bit easier of a time lighting these things the area's a bit more spread out there's no crazy archers to deal with you should be okay lighting them and just getting away with it okay so for the boss itself what you want to do is employ more or less the same strategy that you did for the ancestor spirit down in shifa river however this one has some really cool added abilities such as the ability to steal the life force from the other spirit animals in the arena and heal itself as far as i have discovered or as far as i know you can't prevent that heal from happening i did try to attack some of the spirit animals throughout the fight you can't do anything to them so i'm a little confused on whether or not you could stop the heal for now it doesn't seem like you can but there are a finite number of spirit animals here at least so it seems so the boss shouldn't be able to heal infinitely but if you are running up against like a soft and rage like that where you just can't out damage the boss's heel maybe come back later after you've leveled up your weapon okay so like i said the boss primarily has the same attacks as the ancestor spirit literally the same patterns it has horn swipes it has a slam it has a donkey kick it can run in the air throwing down the water it can walk and throw down the water but then it also gets some enhanced abilities where it glows white and there's a few of these to talk about so the first one is a more enhanced swipe that swipe just does more damage it's not like a grab or anything but you still want to watch out for it the other ability is the heel that i mentioned but then another one is a teleport when you notice the boss seem to slink and almost like fall to the ground it almost looks like it's dying really when you notice that happening it's going to teleport somewhere else in the room so you got to watch out for that the other thing you got to look out for is this big ability this is the heel but you can stand in it and attempt to kind of out damage the heel but you will take damage in return it's doing a big aoe attack what i will say is you don't have to like interrupt the heel at all it's gonna heal for a finite amount it won't go all the way back up to full health at least from about half so you won't have too much to worry about but if you're just trying to ensure that you get the most damage as quickly as possible standing in the heel cone is the way to go so this ability here is just a repeated stomp it's not too difficult to understand what's happening there or even judge where to roll it'll do it three times so just watch out you don't want to roll into the boss for that really you want to try to roll to the side or if you feel like your role is actually going to land you in the middle of the boss that's okay what you really don't want to have happen is you do not want the bosses back legs to hit you so you got to be really careful with your roll there okay so those are basically all the abilities he has a couple of other smaller flashy ones but they really just are like bigger animations into abilities you've already seen such as the water going on the ground or a leg kick or something like that or a swipe really nothing too serious to worry about you can charge but these things are more or less like just the added physical abilities nothing too crazy so i'm going to run out of the heel here just because i don't want to die myself so it goes up to about half health and then we should be able to kill it without too much resistance at this point one thing i do want to mention as we go through the last part of this fight this boss does drop a remembrance which means that you can purchase something for the soul there are two mausoleums located in lyria of the lakes near the ul ruins these two mausoleum turtle things do not have bells and you may have run into them at some point and attempted to duplicate a memory but nothing was coming up those mausoleums can duplicate this boss's memory only at least i have not found you know another type of ancestor spirit since fighting this so there may be more that those uh ones can duplicate but it seems like any of the blue or green not gold boss memories can be duplicated at those specifically the boss's memory can be duplicated at other mausoleums so if you want to take it to one that does have a bell you will be able to duplicate it but it seems like the ones without the bells are specifically made for these types of boss memories at least that's what i've noticed so far there could be other bosses that interact in that way but that remains to be seen that's it if you have any questions please feel

Title: Valiant Gargoyles (Siofra Aqueduct) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: e8bYjUDOo1g
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the valiant gargoyles in the shifter aqueduct in nakren so this fight starts off with one gargoyle and then when you get it to around 50 hp the second one with the twin blade shows up of course so for the first gargoyle things go pretty smoothly there is a big beam ability that you want to watch out for if you are not close to the boss by any means you want to roll to the left because that beam starts to curve to your right at some point and you can end up rolling into it even though you seem to just be on the bleeding edge of the damage you can still take a hit the boss will occasionally change weapons so it'll switch between a sword and then a big two-handed axe the twin blade boss can switch between a twin blade and a one-handed axe so you gotta watch out for that as well i really recommend if you have a big weapon build like a big two-handed great sword or something switch to a different quicker weapon the reason for this is because when you have to fight two gargoyles you will not have as much time to recover from your hits without taking a bunch of damage so switching to a quicker weapon is really going to help you out once phase two begins when the second gargoyle comes in the bosses will begin emitting poison a whole lot it can happen in phase one albeit kind of rare but once there's two one of them always seems to be breathing poison throughout the fight so you see there i rolled to the right of that beam and i wound up taking damage because it begins to curve so always either roll to the left or just try to avoid it by doing anything but rolling to the right rolling to the right is almost certainly going to make you take damage if you're not really close to the boss so what i'm trying to do now is i'm just trying to keep both gargoyles in front of me or at the very least keep an ear out for the second gargoyle this way i know what's coming what we want to do is keep our focus on the first one because we want to make this a 1v1 as quickly as possible it is very important during this phase especially that you do not put your back up against any walls the poison stretches really far and it deals a lot of damage very quickly so you want to make sure you have ample space to get out of that poison and if you're up against the wall you're gonna end up taking damage i mean like the poison is building here and i was nowhere near the boss the plume is so big it's honestly obnoxious but from this point on the boss is gonna start attacking us again so we should be able to get some extra damage in when the boss is changing weapons feel free to just lay into it you can dodge the follow-up attack after it switches pretty easily by just rolling into the boss and it shouldn't be too hard of a challenge there but once it's back to a one-on-one this becomes a lot easier the problem is though this is still technically phase two so the gargoyle is gonna be still breathing a lot of poison so you're gonna spend a lot of time in this phase just running away from poison and just waiting for the boss to come to you the twin blade uh boss very rarely is gonna do any sort of attack that like will cause you to worry about the other end of its twin blade if it's not just spinning the weapon you can really just consider this a one-handed attack weapon it's not doing anything special it's not like it has a big combo where it hits you with the front then hits you with the back then the front again it's either the front or it's spinning it entirely so really not too much to worry about with the twin blade the one-handed axe however is very quick so you want to be careful the boss can delay its attacks by dragging it or just holding its arm up for an extended period of time so you really just want to pay attention to the boss's hands and then attack when the hands start moving towards you when the boss roars is going to slam down the axe and then it's going to follow up by pressing it into the ground again and doing a really big earthquake so when it roars you want to do your best to stay behind the boss and then you won't have to worry about it at all all right so what i recommend doing here is not necessarily baiting out attacks you kind of can't do that against this boss but when it's doing its big aerial attacks just sort of stand still and wait for it to slam down and then just roll through the slam and you'll get a lot of follow-up damage when the boss is doing its big whirlwind you can attempt to get inside of it and keep rolling through the damage that is entirely possible but it is building up a big wind gust that you have to watch out for you can roll through it i've done it but it is quite difficult so you're better off just waiting for a better opportunity so you saw there the boss switched its weapon did a roar and then slammed it down and you had an earthquake to deal with so when it has this axe out or really any time you want to do your best to stay behind the boss so it's going to slam big earthquake unfortunately i got hooked up in that because i wasn't far enough behind the boss but you saw the previous time it is avoidable so we're gonna get another couple hits on the boss it'll go down doing my best not to chase it because i've gotten greedy against this boss plenty of times and paid the price but it probably has two hp at this point 216 there you go all right and that's it those are the gargoyles and you'll get the gargoyle's greatsword and the gargoyle's twin blade for your troubles and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for

Video ID: 7XSkfgbZ0w4
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to scale the divine tower of caled as well as fight the boss godskin apostle there's a few gods against i always forget the name so in order to do this uh you first need access to caleb obviously and then you got to get up to the grails dragon barrow that's technically where it is and then once you get to dragon ball west we can begin the climb so the boss is optional you do not need to fight it in order to activate general radon's great rune um i wish i knew that oh i never saw this guy before was his deal dry dries a bone full dragon surrender your strength let me feed on your heart oh yikes um so you don't need to kill the boss and i felt like a dummy because i found this a while back maybe four or five days ago and uh scaled the whole tower got down found the boss i couldn't beat him and i was like okay i can't activate the great room until i beat him not true i just didn't look the other way to find a different door okay so starting out you're gonna jump onto this branch and then you're gonna jump over here and then really important since you like hop off of uh torrance sometimes it's real oh god it's really oh dude are you kidding me okay we gotta stab me stab wow this guy is i mean first enemy guarding the ladder with for dear life over here congratulations dude you you earned your your pay right there so we're gonna climb here and then i'm actually wearing the armor that the boss drops i just think it's so sick looking okay so once you're over here you want to try to gauge where you're supposed to go next so we're gonna go this way we're gonna very carefully climb along the ledge here but jump because there is a hole we're gonna do the same thing here i have a feeling it should have gone the other way it's all good though yep should have gone the other way like i said it's been a little while since i did this but we'll get it okay cool climb this yep this is right and jump jump jump and then we are going to dismount because there is a guy here oh my god and being right-handed insults games awful see ya okay so we're going to mount up again jump twice because there is a smaller hole there and then once you're here you can pop off we're going to climb this ladder snake eater okay and then we are here great so there is a bonfire here her side of grace so let's rest here okay so if you want to activate the great rune you can just go through this door go up the tower instead we are going to go down and as you can tell by my change of room number i died it's okay though so there's two guards here there's one right there but then there's another one over here that you can try to slam off however he will survive the fall great okay so we're going to drop here the camera can kind of play tricks on you so you got to be very careful and deliberate with how you're walking all right and then we are going to drop here this is going to break but don't worry you'll survive okay then we are going to walk forward and then just drop right here and then we're going to drop again right here just walk into it perfect then we are just going to walk off this ledge we'll land here great and then i always forget jumping is a thing that's why i died jump over here very carefully very carefully okay we're going to walk forward jump here turn around and then we're going to jump again but there's going to be a guard there on our left and he's going to be guarding an elevator that elevator's already at the bottom floor for me so unfortunately i have to do combat whereas you may not have to if i could fireball this guy okay it's not gonna work shield please there we go and i don't want a bow thank you all right oh he's got pots see ya groovy so i'm going to step on the switch the elevator is going to come back up for me they're actually going to come back down this is going to activate our shortcut cool go ahead and hop in and this is going to bring us up here very good ready i don't think there's anything over here let's just double check now all right so there's gonna be a couple guards but we're just gonna walk or climb this ladder this ladder is going to lead to the door on the top floor so what it effectively does that's creepy what it effectively does is makes it so you can start from the top point of grace and then you don't have to do the first set of drops you can just start kill the two guards walk through the door and then climb down this ladder so there you go so now the door is open and you have access to here all right i don't think this is actually illusory no although when my when my sword goes through it i get excited sometimes that happens all right so let's slide down real fast and then we are going to fight what i call godskin acolytes i don't know if they have real names but these guys are strong so he's gonna very coolly walk out here yeah he's fun so he's got this you know flame blade because he's cool you can also check a fireball so you gotta be careful there he goes down cool okay so moving on we are going to walk over here follow this okay and then we're gonna fall here and take a really big spill fall damage makes no sense in this game okay so this switch will activate an elevator and then this elevator will bring us all the way down to the boss and luckily there is a point of grace down there this way you don't have to ever do this again it's calling to you wants you to know that you're safe all right there you go for the boss you want to strap in for a long fight unless you're using summons or any you know fancy ashes of war or anything like that you may have an easier time but for me i decided to drop my two-handed sword and just go back to a one-handed long sword i wanted to be able to attack once or twice and get out safely i was never able to do that with my big two-handed sword it just wasn't possible with the greatsword i would attack once and instantly get shredded for half my life i was not having a good time so i switched to a quicker weapon the boss in phase one i find is more difficult than phase two i only ever reach phase two twice and i was able to kill it that second time so i find the magic of phase two a little bit easier to dodge than all the different physical attacks at phase one in phase one the ability that you can get the most damage off of is that jump if you are able to jump or roll below the boss as it is jumping over you you can get in two quick attacks and if you've been leveling up a one-handed weapon or a quicker weapon chances are you're gonna be okay that fishing hook move is a little deceptive i do my best to get out of range but then there are times where i just get straight up greedy because i want to try to roll into him and deal some damage it is possible if you're able to sort a roll to the side and get out of the way of the fishing hook but there are plenty of other times where that's just not possible when you notice the boss sort of two-hand the blade and then swing it twice almost always that is going to result in a jump but there are times where that results in the spinning blade move so you still got to be paying close attention you can't just assume something is going to happen one other thing that i really should mention for this fight is that you want if you're a shield user you want to have a shield that has a 100 physical block rating but then i've also noticed that the boss can pierce certain shields with some damage so you want to be careful of that you want to make sure that you have a shield that is going to resist piercing damage that is really really important so we are just whittling the boss down here in phase one i was starting to get comfortable with this one-handed attack method this is the first time i tried it and i just happened to be successful with it so i'm really not taking any chances here i was probably i would guess three hp right there i don't know how that wasn't a death but i figured if i got that low i've got to make this one count so i'm just trying to get my bearings again i notice that when i get hit i will start to get hit more and then have to burn through flasks mostly because i'm just trying different things and i got the roll through the fishing hook to work one time so i figured i can make it work every time not so much i must either got lucky or just had the perfect frame timing on the roll that one time that it worked otherwise we're just gonna keep chipping away with this spinning blade if you start taking shield damage do not roll because the boss can catch up to you and the hitbox on that spinning blade juts out a bit from the whirlwind so you can get picked up even when you start to roll so you have to be very very careful there if you start blocking it just take the block hopefully you have enough stamina to where it's just a guard break and then the boss generally will not follow that up right away so once you get the boss to a bath 60 hp phase two will begin and then it really starts to put this god skin thing to use and it starts moving around like a snake but those abilities where it's moving around and like twisting its body all around you can actually just get very close to its feet and deal some damage or just straight up anticipate the next attack you'll notice that this fight is about to go a lot faster it took us about half the fight time to get to phase two but then we're gonna go through phase two a lot faster all right so that ability right there i'm pretty sure you can get close to the boss and just roll through all the damage i never wanted to try just because it seemed like it was doing so much but what you can do is just run away from the boss or straight up run the flame doesn't actually become active until the boss like sets it off and explodes so you are able to just run out of the way and then once you're past the indicator on the ground maybe a little bit further just to be kind of safe once you're past that indicator you just turn around and wait for the boss so you can still roll through all the fireballs the boss can of course do a whirlwind ability where the boss kind of chases you but as you're gonna see in a little while we are able to just get behind the boss while that's happening completely ignore the attack and just lay into the boss and deal a bunch of damage so once you get comfortable seeing these god skin abilities you are able to exploit them where the boss is actually quite vulnerable during those attacks which is why i was saying before phase two is a lot easier than phase one once you get into it and you've seen all the attacks once so it's right here that i realized oh i can just run up to the boss's legs and start dealing damage while this guy's flipping out all around the arena so once i sort of realized that i got a lot more comfortable in this phase and it went a lot faster i have noticed that the fireballs are like deceptively quick sometimes so if you aren't at like max range or i should say if you aren't at mid-range of those fireballs you're probably better off blocking unless you can have a really almost instantaneous response time to when he chucks the fireball otherwise you're gonna get hit from the roll there is one ability that i want you to be aware of where he's stretching his skin and that is the regular physical attack that he can do what's going to happen there is he's going to stretch out attack but then his legs are going to catch up to his body so you have to chase him down it's this one right here so when he does that he will follow up after he reaches his body again so you can't just chase the legs and immediately start attacking you want to wait for that follow-up physical attack right here so he sort of whips around you can roll through that get in on him pretty quick but unless you're very comfortable doing that i recommend just waiting for the attack to be over and if you're close enough by that point then do an attack or two once you're in he can still do that jump albeit a bit more rarely but once he starts doing these god skin abilities you'll realize that he's quite vulnerable during pretty much all of them but you do not want to get too greedy you definitely don't want to get too comfortable because chances are if you're like me you've tried this fight 15 times 20 times and you're just now getting him below 25 hp as you can see here i rolled through the first sweep of that flame was able to sit near his legs and just deal a bunch of damage we only got a little bit more to go here before the boss falls so again i'll just reiterate just try to be safe during phase one and then once you reach phase two you're gonna learn how to exploit all these god skin abilities and it's not gonna be that much of a challenge but of course you wanna do your best to conserve your flasks during phase one this way you don't get in trouble in phase two as you're whittling the boss down and as always don't get greedy so somehow i ended up behind him with that attack there that was not a stretched whirlwind that was just a straight-up whirlwind attack that i somehow made it through so i just kind of walked to the side and i think i just had perfect timing it seemed like total luck i was never able to do that again before this fight i had so many times where that would just shred me every single time so i kind of don't know what happened there but that's it that is the godskin apostle and if you want to go through this doorway that that the boss leaves you're going to get a chest with a really cool item and of course if you want to activate radon's rune you want to go back up to the top of the tower and then just take the other staircase and you'll be at the top of the tower and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking

Title: Black Blade Kindred (Greyoll's Dragonbarrow) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: OqRn5_Zqt8o
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for eldon ring this time i'm going to show you how to fight black blade kindred the gargoyle guarding the b steel sanctum this boss is very difficult however it's a one-on-one fight and the sight of grace is right in front of it so you're able to try this over and over in quick succession so you can learn it pretty easily when the boss has his sword out he has a bevy of quicker attacks than when he has the axe so it's kind of a trade-off he can run around and do a lot of backslashes you got to be very careful for those when the boss sort of stances out and charges he can do one of two things he can either run and start flailing around or he can do a forward stab and then you just roll through that and do a bunch of damage to him when he switches to his axe you gotta watch out because he's going to attack immediately like taking it out is an attack so don't think you have some free opportunity to deal damage to him some of his attacks in this axe form are somewhat delayed so you have to make sure you are holding your roll or your dodge until he starts actually moving towards you so you'll notice that he sort of flies up there and flutters for a second and then slams down i can't tell you how many times and it's gonna happen in this video i can't tell you how many times that he flutters up there and i just immediately roll thinking he's gonna slam down right away he doesn't you gotta watch for when he moves toward you so when he takes out his sword a lot of the time one of the first things he'll do is do a charged beam attack for that attack in particular you want to roll to the left don't roll to the right against that beam it arcs to the right so you're almost guaranteed to get hit the other big thing for this fight here in sword form is that the boss can do a two-handed slam when he's over you the thing is that he's going to slam twice it's not a quick thing so you gotta wait for that second one before you do anything this attack here this major one where he sort of throws the axe in a circle and comes up with two big shock waves you just want to get out of that if you're feeling risky you can roll through both big swings and not take any damage but it is a big risk because if you don't have high enough health that can one shot you especially if you get hit in the back so you know your mileage may vary there if you're gonna go for it but good luck it has been done before i've done it uh not whenever i've me meant to do it but it is possible so this is basically the fight the boss will just keep switching between sword and uh sword and axe and then that's pretty much it um when you notice it fly away chances are it's going to do the beam but i'm not sure if you're able to tell there but it does sort of arc to the right so you always want to roll to the left or if you're far enough away just walk away from it to to the left you should be able to dodge just fine so when the boss has a back slash he will almost always stab forward you got to watch out for that and then again when he's switching weapons he is also attacking so just be careful you don't want to just go in for free damage because it doesn't exist there is no free damage in this fight that's kind of the moral of the story here so when the boss slams down uh if you're on a slope it can be really tricky to dodge it and you're pretty much on a slope the entire time unless you were to kite the boss all the way down but i'm not sure if he would despawn there when the boss is on a slope you have to keep in mind that if you are facing down slope and he's facing upslope his attacks are going to hit you faster than they would otherwise so you have less safety in terms of dodging the attack when you get hit with the red sort of shock wave it doesn't build scarlet rot basically it's blood flame which is a flame that just sticks to you and normally blood flame would build a bleed however that didn't happen so i'm not sure if this is really just supposed to be like a slow burn sort of effect but even after that shock wave is done if you got hit by it you're going to still be taking damage so pay very close attention to your health bar otherwise it can tick down and you'll die without really understanding why it's because of that flame you gotta be very very careful so we're pretty much ending the fight here i'm just trying to get some opportune time on the boss to start dealing some decent damage his head is the weak point when you are facing down slope you can jump and get head shots it does basically double damage but it is very hard because the boss is quite bulky and a lot of time his weapon is actually guarding his face it's not necessarily that he's deliberately blocking but it's just the way that the weapon is positioned that's sort of what happens so we're gonna probably get one more uh sword phase here and with that big axe attack you can roll into the downward slam and get some free damage that is one way to go about it but you do need to be careful because that's slam if you're not at full health or if you don't have enough health it can one shot you so you got to be careful so this beam again arcs to the right the further it goes so just always dodges to the left last few attacks that backslash is always going to get me every single time so that is just a big scoop that he does like i said when he charges his sword he can do one of two attacks he's either gonna flail around or he's just gonna do a big slash so he probably has one hp here one hp left and now he's dead great all right so that is black blade kindred um not too hard of a fight it's very deliberate and you're gonna want to get familiar with this fight for one later on or maybe you've done one later on so this is you know somewhat familiar to you um but these are my stats long sword plus 19 and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to

Title: Fallingstar Beast (Sellia Crystal Tunnel) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: qSSPyGskqWM
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the falling star beast of celia crystal tunnel if you were sent here by a trap leave don't fight this boss if you're low level probably below 70. don't fight this boss i am in love with eldon ring but i hate this boss this is the second one i fought and i can't stand it the arena is very small and the boss uses a lot of big aoe gravity magic so you have to be very careful and you should ideally use a weapon that is quicker than the one i'm using i'm primarily just going in for one or two hits at most but even then because the arena is so small i can wind up getting pushed against the wall and just taking a ton of damage so you have to be very very careful in this fight and do your best to not even keep the boss in the middle because even that's a bad idea in phase two because of an ability that it uses that basically covers a huge huge area but you just don't want to put yourself against a wall that is key to this fight i'll go over the abilities now it has this big jump roll if you are close to the boss you can roll into it and not take damage however the safest bet is to roll to the right and then you should be okay but if you're too far away then you're better off just blocking it's a weird move that kind of arcs in and then when the boss rolls you can take damage from the roll itself the boss can do a bull rush it should normally do it three times but for some reason i saw it do it four times during this fight so be on the lookout for that make sure the boss has fully stopped before you commit to doing any damage the tail swipes are very treacherous because the tail actually grows as it's happening so the tail kind of extends out of the boss as you can see here it grows almost double in size and then it does the tail swipe if you notice the boss's pincers start glowing purple and clicking you got to watch your feet for any purple electricity and then once that appears roll out of the way it'll do it three times and on the third time it's a big aoe so you want to try to run out of that aoe and unfortunately you have to do your best to look at how big that area of effect is and if it's easier or more safe to run forward out of it then back or to the side do that you want to get out of that area as quickly as possible with that said however you can just roll and avoid the damage but it is very difficult so this ability here triggers phase two and that is why i said keeping the boss in the middle of the room is not a good idea because if the boss is in the middle of the room and it uses that ability your likelihood of surviving it or not even getting caught up in it let alone surviving is pretty low so do your best to keep the boss against walls but don't you yourself get put up against a wall it's very difficult that's why i recommend just doing this boss later on in the game the rewards are not that serious but just try that so this is the big area of effect again you saw i had purple lightning twice and then on the third one it was a big area of effect that i just ran out of it's hard to like even anticipate that happening just got to be careful when the boss jumps at you it will swipe its head and if you notice that it rears back and clicks its pincers like it did just there that's a grab and that's a really deadly grab so you have to be careful if the pincers aren't glowing purple and there's no electricity or anything and you see them clicking several times while the boss just sort of stands still it's the grab so just be very very careful all right so i'm near a wall here and this just isn't good so the camera starts flipping out because now the boss is flipping out it's just a mess okay so the boss is near the center of the room and it's going to use this big aoe thing i'm going to get up against the door and i still get lifted so it's not that it's unavoidable it's that you need to try to position the boss against a wall in order to give yourself any hope of making it out alive so this is the big area of effect unfortunately i didn't get out because i ran up against a wall this whole room is a nightmare luckily i blocked that move and even though i'm using a two-handed sword the block still worked blocked about 60 percent of the damage that's very helpful but again very treacherous fight the boss only has a couple more hits but i just use like three or four flasks there in quick succession because of bad camera angles and a wall and a giant bowl in the china shop so in phase two after the boss does a bull rush it can use this beam this is your opportunity for big damage just run up against the boss and deal damage just like dragons and that's it again come back to this boss later in the game all you get for it is a bell that unlocks the ability to purchase level one and 2 sombra smithing stones it's not that serious of a reward okay that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guys for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you

hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the dragonkin warrior in the lake of rot this is a completely optional boss so you can just ignore this thing and move on but that is not what i'm about so i recommend fighting the boss on this platform here it is in my opinion the biggest one it gives you the most opportunity this is probably not the first dragonkin warrior that you're fighting probably fought a couple of these in the past before this is not the kind that flies don't worry you just have to worry about physical attacks but this thing is very strong uh so strong in fact that i thought that maybe i shouldn't be in this area but in my opinion the boss is just overpowered um so it's just a very strong enemy that you're gonna have to deal with it doesn't have a lot of health though it does go down fairly quickly you just have to kind of whittle away what i will say the biggest tip i can give you is use a faster weapon i normally use a two-handed greatsword build however the speed at which i was swinging my greatsword was too slow and the boss would constantly punish me basically every single hit the boss would punish me so i just switched back over to a long sword which i think i had at plus 19 at the time so just use a quicker weapon that's my advice the boss has lots of thrashing attacks the deadliest one of all is when he uses either his left or right hand and sort of like [ __ ] it back a little and then throws it at you the worst one is when he does this with his left hand this attack right here that's really hard to dodge and you just have to stare at it for a second and then the instant it starts moving at you that's when you want to dodge you also need to be very careful because right after he does that attack he will rip the hand back and that'll deal damage to you as well another really big tip i can give you and this is really what solved the fight for me is that whenever you need to reposition and get away from the boss what you should do is target the boss and then block while backing up this allows you to not get hit in the back which is going to be a source of a lot of deaths getting hit in the back in a game like this is basically like a guarantee critical against you so you have to be very careful so when repositioning don't just run away from the boss just make sure your stamina is high as can be and then just target the boss and back up this also allows you to keep an eye on the boss and see what he's doing because as you saw there he stuck his hand into the ground and when it's in there for a long time and it has rubble around the hand that's going to be an earthquake so you want to get as far away from the boss as possible so sometimes he doesn't do the earthquake it's got to have rubble surrounding the hand like coming out of the ground so yeah targeted to back up just like i'm doing here like get a few hits in target them and then back up that's really the pattern you want to fight for once i started doing that i felt so much more in control of this fight in particular that he was really not much more of a challenge that said though he still is a dragonkin warrior so he can do a whole lot of things something i will mention is that the boss can push you out of the arena so if you uh i mean you're in the lake of raw chances are you doing this anyway make sure you have a couple of the ballises that heal the scarlet rot uh make sure you have a couple of those ready just because the boss can push out and when that happens it's usually with a really big slam and you're going to basically build up an entire scarlet rot bar by the time you wake up out of that put down by the time you recover so you want to like quickly jump back onto the platform get your bearings heal up and then get rid of the scarlet rot and that's it that's the fight it is hard it took me a little while the biggest challenge is just getting to it with as many flasks as possible but as long as you have balances you should be okay and this boss drops the dragon scale blade which was dropped by the stone digger troll in the demo so this weapon was locked pretty far into the game i will add so that was interesting but that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll see johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye-bye well we know now okay cool thanks for the thanks for the moral support everybody really appreciate it in the notes now my i'm like shaking

Title: Astel, Naturalborn of the Void (Lake of Rot) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: i3RO_rUgwCc
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat aztel natural born of the void this boss is on drugs so it has a railgun that it shoots out of its third eye that is in its fractured skull the way to dodge it is when you see the boss nod its head that is when you want to roll you can roll through it it's a hit scan sort of railgun kind of thing so left right center doesn't matter just don't roll backwards so the object here is to hit the boss in the face for the most part and the reason for that because that's the weak point um it is pretty much like it it's hittable from its limbs but his limbs are always moving and most of the attacks come from the from the front hands or the skull so you want to try your best to stay in front of the boss as often as possible or at least around its skull when the when the blue eye glows and the pincers glow that is a big grab that the boss is going to attempt to do you want to just wait for the boss to move its head towards you and then roll it's basically like freaking you out the whole time as most grab attacks do from bosses so just be careful there when the boss puts a purple orb on the ground with one of its hands there's going to be two shock waves that emit from it you can roll through those the timing is a little tough otherwise you could just roll or run to the back of the boss and you should be able to avoid it so the boss can teleport and you got to watch out because when it does that it has a 50 50 chance of either just teleporting away and going somewhere else or flying down to you and doing another super devastating grab that i may be convinced is a one shot so just let me know if you're able to survive that because i never was so when the boss teleports away you don't want to be near it because the teleport does an aoe explosion so you don't want to get caught up in that and then you want to just look in the sky and kind of keep your ear out if the boss doesn't appear like right away in a different area of the room chances are it's flying and trying to get you into grab so just watch out for that the boss shares the big doctor strange mirror dimension kind of attack that the falling star beasts have you do want to look out for that i would say this one is less devastating because the chances of you getting hooked up by it not that they're small or anything i'm getting hooked up by it every single time but to me the damage was a lot less so obviously like i wasn't at full health there so things you know took a turn for the worse but i was trying to check what my health was it was probably around 15 to 20. i wasn't just trying to spam menus there that was very deliberate so that's basically all the boss's attacks until it drops below 50 health when that happens it's gonna start doing some really really crazy stuff for now though in phase one the boss will constantly do these like big sweeping strikes that result in stardust being put down in front of it and then that stardust will explode so that's why staying in the boss's face or behind its head is really really key that's always going to be helpful to you so you see there the boss teleported and then right away you could see where it was going to appear if you don't see that right away chances are it's in the air to grab so this is that big attack that it can do once it gets near or below 50 hp i think it's probably somewhere closer to 60 percent that's really the big new attack that it gets everything else is mostly the same when you notice the boss clicking its pincers it's going to do like a a swipe towards you a couple times you should be on the lookout for that uh one thing i do want to mention is do not i shouldn't say do not but in my kind of experience here i normally use a big two-handed weapon uh when fighting everything it's a big great sword bringing that into this boss fight was really painful because the attacks were so slow that the boss could basically follow up on me no matter what i could barely do any damage without taking a ton of damage myself so i recommend using a faster weapon doesn't have to be a rapier fast it doesn't have to be crazy it could just be a long sword that's really leveled up that's all it needs to be so just keep that in mind you want something fast not too lumbering not too slow so you saw the grab there the boss basically teleported from the sky and then flew down he didn't teleport somewhere else in the room so this is the big meteor attack one of the ways you can help yourself with this is to get as far away from possible and then just run in one direction so you can see which meteor is coming towards you and then just dodge that one or two that may be heading in your general direction it'll always be at least one i usually got two sometimes i even got three they're they're pretty big and you don't want to spam roll it could just be kind of hard to tell how many are you know showing up uh to come and get you so just be on the lookout for that but being far away helps a great deal luckily aztel was kind enough to push me out of the way of that explosion so thank you very much um and yeah that's sort of the fight so he'll go down there's no you know special space three or anything that's the whole fight and this unlocks a really cool area that you may be wondering how to get to before so i'll leave that surprise for you uh the way you do get to this boss is through the lake of rot when you get to the big ruins area after the big lake look for a coffin and you'll go down here so that's how you get here i'm going to be making a guide that shows you how to get to this general area because there's so much down here and it's not an obvious area that you go to you do have to wait for general radon to be dead and then nokron opens up to you and then all this is down there so that's sort of the general idea all right but that's it if you have

Title: Glintstone Dragon Adula (Moonlight Altar) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: Fdpity7hYeA
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat glindstone dragon aguila in the moonlight altar region of leonia of the lakes this boss will have disappeared on you if you fought it in the area called three sisters past karya manor it only reappears here after you've defeated aztel natural born of the void right before it in order to do that you need to defeat a general radon in order to give yourself access to nakron via lim grave in the mistwood ruins so lots of questing in order to access even just this boss so it is a typical dragon fight however the boss has a brand new set of abilities two of which are key number one is a breath that forms a crystal that explodes and can more or less one shot you the way to deal with that is to get behind the hard rocks in the arena not the crumbling ruins the crystals can sort of go through those walls if you're close enough instead you want to get behind the big rock formations the other ability that this boss has is it can fly in the air real high and conjure a sword in its mouth this is a little tough to deal with the reason i'm saying that is because if the boss is coming to you on the upslope meaning you're high up on the hill and the boss is flying towards you if it's going to do that then what you can do is just double jump over the sword and maybe you'll catch some frostbite but you won't take any damage if the boss is coming to you while you're on the downslope however most of the time all you need to do is just roll under it just get under the boss and you should be okay so you saw there i took frostbite damage the wave hit me and unfortunately i had to use a uh a flask to revive torrent and then right after that the boss did the other follow-up attack where it spawned the crystals out of its breath and when that happens you just get behind the rock formations and you can dodge them you should have plenty of time to reach any rock formation otherwise i recommend just trying to get off torrent in time and blocking or rolling through them they do track so even just like trying to double jump with torrent and get around it's really not gonna do much for you you you do need to get behind those rocks or just get off and block so either or other than that this is a standard dragon fight so it has a snap it has a tail swipe it has a slam it can stomp with its feet it can fly around and slam into the ground like this it can also do a breath it still has that so just be on the lookout for that it has all the formations of a breath including a normal one which it's about to do here and then they can of course fly and you know do breath that way so just be careful this boss will fly around the arena and end up despawning if you get too close to the ruins areas um if that happens just walk back to the uh to where you first found her and then you'll be able to fight her again and the uh the health bar will be the same so nothing to worry about so there is the tail swipe that one can do a ton of damage so we're just gonna try to get in here my weapon is really slow but i keep going for double jumps down slope and trying to get a head shot it works sometimes other times it doesn't but you will finally be able to defeat this boss it will no longer disappear on you and for your troubles you will get a dragon heart as well as the agilis moonblade sorcery so here are my stats and also show you where this is on the map it's just above the village of the albanorics but again it requires a ton of questing to get to you have to defeat general radon enter knockron through the mist wood adventure all the way through there make it so far into this game that it's crazy i will be making a guide showing how to access a lot of bosses maybe something like a list of hey here's what you do to access this bunch of bosses here you go just because explaining it all at the beginning of every video would make it be like a 15 minute video this game is so involved it's crazy but that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye-bye uh okay sorry there's a lot of questions here sorry yeah see this i i agree with you this um it's definitely more accessible just for the simple fact that like if you're up against a wall and you can't beat something you can just leave and go somewhere else like that is such a strong

Title: Fia's Champions (Deeproot Depths) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: PWjBmU8zqZo
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat fia's champions so once you reach the throne of the prince of death a champion will invade you this guy running towards you really nothing too much to worry about has a halberd and a turtle shield he goes down pretty quick i will admit my weapon i think is too over leveled for this area but the next boss that comes after this i definitely was not over leveled for so i think this might just need some rebalancing or it's not meant to be that difficult so next up is sorcerer roger he is a cloth wielder and has no poise whatsoever you should be able to cut through him pretty easy just roll through his glintstone arc there and he should go down without too much of a fight up next is the real fight however i'll be the first to admit my weapon just absolutely destroys these guys so if you have a big great sword like me or some sort of super strong weapon that can break poise just get them all in a clump and go nuts the samurai champion has very low health i know i'm using a great sword but you see how much damage i did to lionhearted and it's nothing compared to what i did to the samurai so you also have a prisoner here the prisoner is actually who i would focus because he can cast spells and those can be kind of annoying because they can kind of control where you can and cannot stand um what i recommend doing is trying your best to get one of them to follow you and then attacking it while it's away from the others it's easier said than done these are ai npcs not always the smartest lionel can summon some necromancers and those skulls will follow you to kingdom come so you got to be careful one of the main reasons i'm making this guide even though i've demolished the boss is because there's something i want to tell you fia spawns after this fight right in front of the point of grace i actually missed her entirely until i came back here later looking for something else she is a really important npc and what i recommend doing is if you have not already go visit the divine tower of lyrnia if you have not done that already i have a guide linked in the description below it's a long quest chain but it is very much worth doing because after you visit the divine tower and then you speak with her you can unlock an extra boss fight in this arena and that boss fight is next level all right i'll link that in the description below but again i hope this was a little helpful to you given my current setup and build and weapon choice this fight was nothing for me so hopefully this helped but if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Lichdragon Fortissax SECRET BOSS (Deeproot Depths) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: qMiq7Vr0op4
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny gage here back with another guide for elven ring i'm literally grinning right now because this boss is so sick and i'm so eager to help you kill it so this is lips dragon fortis axe this boss is only accessible if you have been following along ronnie's quest line as well as fia's quest line although they diverge at this point you need to have recovered the curse mark of death from the divine tower of leonia i have a full walkthrough for how to access that it is quite long so that's its own video to get down here to fia you need access to nakron in order to do that you need to have defeated general radon and then a new area will have opened up just near the wood in limb grave and then you could adventure through nakron and knock stella and get to this area which is a really long journey and i'm gonna make a separate guide for it but once you reach fia you wanna give her the curse mark of death and then keep exhausting her dialogue and reloading your game until she tells you that she is going to bed with godwin and then reload one more time and she will allow you to access the dream that she is in and then you can fight litch dragon fortisacks it's a really long quest line i'll have like a full video on the whole knockron thing coming out soon i'll link it in the description below when that's ready but for now let's go over the boss and get started litch dragon fortisack begins the fight by summoning lightning down to the ground and when lightning strikes in these locations instant death clouds will spawn and if your instant death meter builds up all the way you will die so don't let that happen while that's happening though the boss is somewhat idle at least in the beginning of the fight for the first time so you can rush in get some damage going and then move out you do want to be careful though because the boss can fly away and breathe fire straight down on you you really don't want to be in the middle of that because that can one shot you if you're basically dead center i've had it happen to me while the boss is attacking as you're under it you gotta watch out for when it slams its hands into the ground when that happens most of the time there's going to be a charge behind it which will cause lightning to arc back to you this happens in waves it's going to happen right here so it splits kind of in four directions primarily so you gotta look for the diagonal to either roll through a walk through i actually don't really recommend trying to roll through the lightning the arc is wide and tall so there's a chance that it can hit you even on the way down you'll see here that i'm only going in for maybe four attacks maximum when i'm behind the boss because i need to be able to walk away safely to get the mark of lightning off of me so it strikes when i'm not there so that's my strategy i'm just going in for a few hits once i start to get the feeling that the mark is going to drop off i'll move away and then reset and move in so you see there the lightning splits in four directions but the arcs are wide and tall so you really can't you know just roll through it unless your timing is perfect just keep that in mind after a while the boss will start flying around and then you can do a couple of attacks you can either just breathe fire and that's great you can just avoid that or what it'll do is some sort of lightning attack so it's gonna happen here in a moment the boss gets a sword occasionally of lightning it can summon one usually you'll see this happening in front of you that's really the only time he's done it to me while i was underneath him i think it happened once or twice so that's pretty rare but that sword will usually come out while the boss is in the air so he's gonna fly up here and then if this is just a reposition so he's trying to get us to run into the cursed clouds we see the dragon fly up and start to snake its neck the sword is coming out you can just roll through that it's a little hard to see because of the lighting effects but basically you just want to roll super late it is possible i believe i do it in this video so just keep that in mind it is it is hard though but it is rollable or you can just block it if you have a shield that will block lightning as well as physical go ahead and equip that as long as it's not going to weigh you down too much or change how you like to roll that is a decent strategy it is just lightning damage and physical unless you count the instant death which you just don't want to be anywhere near and of course fire from the breath but he uses so few fire attacks that those are easily avoided the boss will sometimes just start crawling to you if that happens i don't recommend running in trying to get damage instead i recommend just waiting it out and seeing what happens because sometimes he'll fly up get a sword and start chasing you so you saw there i rolled through it as long as your spacing is decent it's a much easier to see the last time i was just too close and i couldn't tell what was going on but it is rollable so the boss is summoning down the instant death lightning again just do your best to walk while the mark of lightning is on you if you're able to avoid that four split lightning arc that's kind of tough to do especially when you're close range but you can always tell it's happening because the ground will light up while you are attacking the boss if that starts to happen an attack is coming so you saw he did it twice there the tell for when he has the sword whilst on the ground is that he will begin to pivot while doing those slams if the boss begins to pivot while you were under him like ross from friends that means he has the sword and he's going to use it and start pivoting around and slamming it twice and creating multiple art uh lightning arcs so just be careful with that but look out for the pivot if he's not pivoting then you don't have to worry it's just a typical slam all right so we only have one hit left on the boss and i'm just doing my best to stay alive because i was at this point once before and died i couldn't actually tell what was happening there i was certain the boss was breathing fire but he actually had the lightning sword so i made a mistake there but if you're ever afraid just do your best to run out try to keep an eye on the boss do your best but it's better to run out and then just wait reposition and then go back in even if it's just for that one last tip so you heard in the background that was my exclamation i accidentally left my microphone open when recording this as i was streaming so usually i separate the two and just have a you know a standalone recording of the footage in 4k hdr while i'm streaming at 1080p but i mute the microphone in that other application totally forgot to do that so some of these videos have me talking that's why they're very quiet but you heard my exclamation this is the craziest boss i've done so far in this game it's sting said it's a little hidden frankly but it's so worth doing the quests to get to it the quests themselves are fun they open up new areas they're great to do and of course they result in this and that's it that is let's dragon fortisacks if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're

Title: Mohg, the Omen & Mohg's Shackle Location - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: II3I-8sdd9k
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to find and defeat mog the omen just a big heads up i'm not going to show you the entire way there just how to get into the area the reason being it's a sewer maze and when you open certain doors you can move a bit more freely so if i were to show you now it just wouldn't make any sense to you so you just gotta adventure through the area until you reach the boss but i will show you how to get into the area because it is quite hidden so all this is going to take place in lane dell capital city and we are going to begin at the avenue balcony side of grace and we are going to move over here to this mark on my map okay i'm just going to run right through i'm going to ignore as best i can all the mobs then we can jump into here jump here and then there is a well right here that we can jump into okay and you can open this door and you can jump down here and then run through this hallway recommend equipping a lamp or have a torch handy and here you are the subterranean shunning grounds for the most part these rats uh kind of ignore you so that's nice i'm going to show you how to reach the side of grace down here at least the first one and then i'm going to show you how to get an item that will greatly help you out in phase one of this fight you can get it pretty early on here but it is heavily guarded so i'll just show you where it is and you can go grab it yourself all right so i managed to die somehow which is not great but we are going to run through this gate i'm assuming you have this open you really kind of can't get this item until you do anyway so come back once you have this gate open and then we're going to jump down to the surface of the sewer so you can drop onto this pipe and then if you try to drop onto the pipe on the bottom you will die so you got to drop from here and then like i said this item is going to be heavily guarded so we can run through this pipe and what i recommend doing is ignoring this guy as best you can because there is actually this this is the lanedale catacombs there's another side of grace here so we're going to rest here just to reset the crayfish or is that a lobster or a crayfish i don't know it's gigantic i know that okay so the uh the item in question i don't know this is even going to work crouching nope the item in question is going to be back here on a corpse and it's going to be i'll show you in a second once i dodged this guy enough okay so the item in question is going to be this mog's shackle so it allows you to bind mog twice so you can use it during the fight it'll show it in the ball strategy but it's very similar to margaret's shackle which you buy from patches early on in the game and because mog is also part of the omen he can be bound as well using his shackle all right let's get to the boss strategy mog has some very interesting movements most of them are delayed in terms of when he starts his movement the hit comes much later so there's also a weird chance of when he does his overhead slam it actually gets stuck either on the pillar or a ceiling or something um not really sure how to predict that it just would happen randomly for me and it feels like you you're getting a second chance at life when it does to use mog shackle you want to be very close to the boss and then just use the item you can get a full combo plus one hit if you're really fast at starting the combo but he is able to be hit one more time while he's getting up but you are limited to two cycles of this you cannot use it after that the boss has a lot of blood flame abilities um when you see him sort of standing still for an extended period of time and his hand is reaching up into a poorly in the sky that means that he's just gonna make it rain around him and so you just want to back up i don't recommend trying to hit him through this because it's just gonna stagger you and take damage and you're gonna get interrupted constantly see i pressed r1 there and i immediately got stuff so just back up let him reset and get your bearings so all of his physical attacks are on a delay meaning that once he starts his animation the hit comes later what this means is that you want to just pay close attention to his right hand he doesn't really have any two-handed attacks physically except for the bull rush ability which isn't too hard to dodge that one's like the only ones not on any sort of delay but pretty much everything else you just want to look at his hand when his hand starts moving toward you that's when you want to dodge it's not when the weapon moves towards you it's when his hand moves towards you you see there that he sort of just holds the trident back for a while and then swings it at you so you just gotta watch his hand and then you want to dodge this combo here is three hits it is three hits i said to myself out loud while fighting him john you've gotta learn that that's a three hit combo and not a two hit combo when he does the blood flame claw there's a pretty high probability that he's going to do the trident bull rush immediately after so quickly that he's actually buffering it while the blood flame claw animation is still going so don't assume that you can just roll through blood flame claw and you know start wailing on him you can roll through it and maybe get one attack off but you have to be careful because he's almost it's like a 50 50 pretty much that he's either gonna do the trident bull rush or just go into a regular physical swinging combo the two blood flame sprays we'll call them he has one that goes out in an arc this is really easy to roll through and then you can just get some follow-up hits on him no problem the other one moves directly towards you so this is the arc you ideally want to move through that but i was trying to move back this way i can safely heal but most times i will just roll through it the other blood flame spray just comes out in a stream directly towards you i tend to always roll to the right in these games but i think to avoid the one that's coming straight at you you may want to try rolling to the left as long as you roll in some direction not forward or back if as long as you roll left or right you'll only take a tick or two of damage and chances are it's not going to build your bleed meter that high it's not going to do that much damage it's really just there to kind of interrupt you and start getting you to take damage and build your bleed meter but just try rolling to the left for the for the direct spray but that's pretty much the entire fight he doesn't have a phase two he doesn't start getting any more aggressive um you know once his health drops below 50 it's just this fight over and over so once you have successfully learned these this one set of attacks there's only like six or seven of them once you've successfully felt comfortable dodging them you're gonna be fine the uh blood flame claw ability he can do two different kinds of that that i should mention one is very quick and the other one has a bit of a wind-up the one that's very quick you can just roll through no problem and start attacking pretty much immediately don't go too deep into a combo just get one hit and see what he does afterward but the other one he sort of delays the claw and is trying to bait you into rolling into him but when you do that he's going to turn to match where you are and what this means is that you're going to be unsuccessful at least most of the time attacking him while he does that i've just now realized the two tells for the blood flame claw abilities and what the differences are there's a forehand attack and a backhand attack the forehand attack he puts the staff down and then just starts readying the spell and attacks in a forehand motion meaning it's coming from the back and moving forward that's the one that you don't want to try to roll through you want to try to get away from otherwise he's going to track you and you're going to get hit the other one is a backhand where he just puts his hand forward and rakes it back that's the quick one that you can roll through so the forehand don't attempt to roll through it to get follow-ups just get away from it the backhand is what you can roll into and get follow-ups just keep that in mind but that's it that's mog this is a really fun boss i really enjoyed learning him it was i i thoroughly enjoyed this fight getting to it however was a complete nightmare i will make a guide very soon and i will link it in the description once it's ready of how to navigate this sewer maze it's a nightmare i can't stress that enough it is a nightmare but that's a video for another

Title: Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Leyndell, Capital City) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: U2jd1fqLpsE
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to get to and defeat godfrey first elden lord just getting this out of the way i don't know this is i don't know if this is actually godfrey or if this is just a shade of godfrey like in sakura how you fought corrupt monk twice i have no idea i haven't gotten that far just to stave off that question but in order to get there we're going to assume that you have access to lane dell capital city and that you have reached the avenue balcony side of grace so from here we are going to run down the avenue and i'm not actually going to do the entire route just because it's a little long but what you want to do is you want to get to this point and start climbing up the corpse of the dragon if you haven't killed everybody you want to try to be fast because they will follow you up here rest assured they're coming and then once you're able to get up here you want to follow this talon jump down and then you can climb this ladder here and then we're going to walk up these stairs and then there is a sight of grace right through this building i'm going gonna ignore that at night oh yeah that's what i get there's a guy with a dirk in there okay so just rest here and that's basically part one and then part two i'm just going to show this from a distance you want to climb along the tree roots over here so i'll show you where to start and what direction to head in because it is a bit of a trek so we're gonna climb up these tree roots and then actually i think we could do it all in one shot here maybe we'll see how it goes i haven't actually tried to do this in one run there's another route you can come from if you explore the building across the roots so that's that's where i came from if we don't die we're gonna be okay i think we're fine hopefully these guys don't have long range attacks okay so once you make it up here this is the arena for the boss so with that said let's get into the boss strategy godfrey has some really big damaging attacks but they are all pretty deliberate only a couple of them move very suddenly and can really catch off guard i've noticed that when starting the boss on repeat attempts he will almost always start with a jump and an axe toss he does this if you are too far away from him and during this fight even though the arena is gigantic you really have no reason to be that far away from him so you're probably not going to see that attack more than once just in my experience so that move there the two-handed slam that's really the quickest move of this fight you don't really have any other attacks that move too quickly i do notice that he borrows some moves from the crucible knights i guess maybe he trained them most notably the stomps that cause earthquakes so when you see him kick up his legs a stomp is coming and with that is an earthquake if you get hit by the earthquake you're almost guaranteed to take a big chunk of a follow-up hit so just be ready for that i don't recommend trying to roll out of that earthquake stun because chances are you have such a long recovery time from it that you're better off just holding up your shield and blocking if you are using a shield even if you're just using a two-handed weapon block anyway you're gonna get clipped in the roll almost guaranteed that said i try it every single time even though i know it's bad for me but i'm just telling you now just try to block and set a roll this way you don't get clipped all right so again the stomps he can follow that up with a bevy of different attacks wide variety pretty much anything in his arsenal he can follow up with he saw that big swing there his weapon is only it only has a hurt box on the axe itself he can drag the staff and as long as you know it's early enough in the wind up the staff part of the axe doesn't really do much it doesn't you have to worry about it it's really just that axe that you got to be careful of so when he does that big spin move almost always he's going to follow it up with an overhead slam so you do need to be mindful of that he can dash right into you throughout the fight so don't you know get too much distance between you and the boss because he will close the gap very quickly either with that dash or the jump move so just be careful with that when he starts doing bigger combos he's going to spin the axe around quite a few times you want to just keep an eye on his shoulders and see if he's going to keep moving some of his abilities do not have quick transitions from one to the other so you need to be mindful of his upper body and if that is still moving or if it looks like it's about to start moving he's going to do another follow-up some of his combos get cut short he's a little tricky like that so you can't always predict what he's going to do so you just have to keep an eye on the body and if that's moving that's usually your tail so we're whittling him down here he doesn't really have any other abilities that we haven't seen already but again just long combos just be on the lookout for those these stomps can be quite deadly i have gotten more or less one shot after a stomp if he's feeling like a full combo is the order of the day so just be careful on that luckily the steak america is literally right outside the door so there's no run to this boss you just walk forward go through the door and challenge him again like i said the arena is quite big so try your best not not to necessarily stay in his face but you don't want to run too far away i was using both a two-handed weapon and a one-handed weapon in this fight if you're using a two-handed weapon don't go for long combos just get one hit in and bounce and then reset that said if you're using a long sword you can go in for a few and you're and you're quite fine here are my weapons uh primarily use the lord sworn straight sword plus 22 and for your reward you get a talisman pouch which should probably be your fourth by now uh or your third pouch to allow you to equip a fourth talisman this is the location on the map and that's it if you have any questions please feel

Title: Morgott, the Omen King (Leyndell, Capital City) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: R_07gQ6nO10
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat margot the omen king you can summon melena for this fight and she's got some moves however i will not be doing that for the purpose of this guide but if you'd like summoner once and just see what she's all about she will surprise you it's pretty sick okay so margot has a lot of the same moves as margaret the phil omen from stormdale castle but he is kind of on steroids so his staff is replaced with a i don't even know if he would want to call it a katana it moves a lot faster and he's able to do really crazy combos with it alongside the gold weapons that he's able to summon so he has a spear a hammer a sword and a dagger when it comes to the moves borrowed from margaret those are mostly the same for the most part however he gets new ones so you saw there he can summon the hammer hold it in his hand come up to you slice and then do a horizontal slam with the hammer or he can delay the hammer and do an overhead slam this move here it's actually a lot easier to dodge and manage than you might think once you see him summoning all these daggers just run back and then look for a quadrant to stand in the daggers fall in an x it's in a cross so you got to be careful just find yourself a quadrant stick to it and eventually the spell will run out you saw there the boss did a crazy combo my recommendation for that and this is going to sound silly but just block don't attempt to roll 50 times through it because it's not gonna work out and you're gonna take a ton of damage believe it or not the boss does pause between attacks so you have a little bit of time to regain some stamina so you won't get guard broken unless of course you don't have enough stamina to withstand it but my recommendation is to just block and not attempt to you know be a genius or anything and have perfect dodges 50 times just block you're okay that said however if you are far enough away from him when he starts it then you can back away dodge a couple times and then run in and get a couple attacks off so the boss once he reaches a bad 50 he will get on one knee transition to phase two the timing for that spear throw the timing to dodge it you want to pay attention to the boss's left foot when his left foot is about to hit the ground that's when you want to dodge not sooner not later this foot is like a few centimeters from hitting the ground that's when you want to dodge and you'll get it every single time so here in phase 2 the boss is able to coat his sword and blood and do a whole bunch of cool stuff one of them is a grab you can get hooked up it is pretty deadly when that happens but if you're at full health you shouldn't die it's very easy to miss but when the boss slams down one of his weapons onto the ground that spot will turn into a geyser this can happen from both the god weapons or the divine weapons or whatever you want to call these gold glowy weapons as well as the sword so if a weapon ever slams into the ground not you know hitting you and hitting your shield has to actually touch the ground a geyser will spawn and it takes a few seconds for it to go off so the only other move that i haven't really covered here is the spear charge for that you actually want to roll pretty early because you're gonna be able to roll through the entire thing but you have to start early the other ability here is an overhead slam that he has this is actually the same exact overhead slam that margaret had it's just with a different weapon so the strategy there is to just hold right and then once the sword goes down just attack him that's it for the really crazy combos i just recommend blocking as best you can don't try to be a hero and dodge through everything he can really drain your stamina and if you get clipped once in the combo by trying to dodge and miss timing it you're going to die you can almost guarantee it so don't try to be a hero just block the long flurries of attacks and you'll be okay again you can summon melinda for this fight she has a gold sign just outside the fog door it's a little hard to see she goes buck wild with it she's really cool i didn't use her but i did summon her once just to see what she did and i was blown away so definitely check it out for yourself once you defeat margot you will get his great rune and the story continues that's it for this guide if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elven ring

Title: Commander Niall (Castle Sol) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: PR9N-MaMQT0
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down commander nile in castle soul in the mountain tops of giants first off i want to apologize for the quality of this video i know it's not up to snuff when compared to every other video my capture software messed up just as i killed this boss corrupted the footage and i had to rip it off my ps5 so it looks a little grainy i know sorry about that but effective enough for a guide as always okay so starting off you want to immediately start attacking the spirit with the dual building swords if you have a great sword or some sort of heavy weapon you will be able to just kind of abuse these guys and they shouldn't be able to get too much damage off on you but the guy with the shield is probably the trickiest because he has a shield dash that also has a frost whirlwind what this means is he will hold up his shield dash toward you and then slam it and then on the slam there will be a frost whirlwind the way to dodge that successfully you'll see it here just roll into him that's it if you time it correctly you won't take any damage i did notice rolling backwards i would 99.9 of the time take damage from it so just roll into the shield bash okay so throughout that whole process commander nile really won't bother you too much it's when the adds die that the real boss fight starts and this guy has a knife for a foot and that knife is lightning because why not okay so he's got quite a few attacks many of them end with this where he slams the standard down and then that causes a frost whirlwind believe it or not that can be dodged and i will do it one time in this video so you can see as possible the timing is just really difficult you don't have to try to dodge it but it's really one of your only times for follow-up damage otherwise you're just gonna be whittling this guy's health down which i will be doing in this guide so i'll be joining you in that but you can dodge it so when he does the big two-swipe whirlwind in the just long animation he has a couple attacks that he can come out of that with probably the most deadly is not even that dash it's a dash that has a ton of attacks that come after it and you'll see it here in this video it's this right here so when he doesn't actually do a whirlwind right away and he just starts going nuts with it that's the big attack he doesn't always do it though like i've gone through attempts where i've gotten him down to one or two hits and he never even does it but when he does do it what you're actually better off doing is getting hit by the frost whirlwind just before he starts moving around because the frost whirlwind isn't gonna do a lot of damage to you and it's gonna leave you invulnerable to his other attacks and then you just get up and hit him six or seven times while he recovers so the really there it is i dodge it see the really deadly thing is the lightning foot he can do this close range and he also has a jump with it that is easy enough to avoid but the close range one that can one shot you from 100 to zero he cuts your neck open like an ice skate it's crazy so the only tip i can really give for dodging the lightning foot the jump is pretty easy on its own just roll when he's finally falling back towards you but for the close range one really the only advice i can give to you is just stare at his foot and then the second it starts moving toward you that's when you want to roll you don't want to roll before you don't want to roll as soon as he sparks and you certainly don't want to try to roll afterward you want to roll once the foot starts moving towards you all of his standard attacks although i'm not i don't think the whirlwind can be parried but the rest of his regular standard attacks like this right here those can be parried he only needs one parry to be reposted so he's not you know big body boss like margaret that requires two or three parries you just pair him once and that's it so that's basically the fight it just goes on for a while because you don't have many opportunities to just deal a ton of damage to him what i recommend doing is when he does that lightning jump hit him once roll to avoid the standard attack and then you can get a follow-up also whenever he does the lightning foot attack he will try to poke you with the butt end of the standard and then that will interrupt whatever you're doing unless you have very high poise and then what this means is it's going to deal damage to you interrupt you and then expose you for some other follow-up attack you'll notice that as soon as phase two started in this fight for me i used a rune arc and activated uh godric's great rune the reason for that is because the added stats that you get from that are really really helpful and i was mostly just looking for extra health because i was trying to not get murdered by his lightning foot i was not able to survive it without a great rune active so if you have a rune arc try to get familiar enough with phase two to the point where you feel like if i just had a little bit more health i would be able to do it once you start feeling that way start activating rune arcs in the fight and you should be able to take him down but as you can see the fight just lasts a long time there's really no way about it it's just going to be a battle of attrition yeah dodge it again look at that it's going to be a battle of attrition where you are just taking one shot at a time adam doesn't get much more complicated than that unfortunately he can build frostbite on you pretty quickly but if you have the ability to create the ballas's or boluses that remove frostbite if you found that cookbook it's a great fight to use it in and they do get active quickly you don't have to like wait for a long animation to get rid of all the frostbite and then if you do that then you can kind of put yourself in those situations where you are kind of ignoring the frostbite build up and then you can either not worry about trying to roll through the frost whirlwind you could just stand in it while blocking and then get some follow-up damage that's another strategy if you are okay using a lot of consumables either way you want to go is fine as long as he dies so here i was just kind of getting tired of him said you know what eat black flame that's how i'm going to kill you all right once he drops you get the veteran's prosthesis show you where he is on the map here up here in the mountains and then you will also want to go through the door that just opened up and then you're going to get a pretty good treasure at the top of this castle and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a

Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to navigate lanedale catacombs solve the maze find the switch and then defeat the boss esker priest of blood alright so from the site of grace we are going to take this route i'm not going to fight anything things may try to fight me can't really control that but i'm not going to fight anything i'm just going to run straight to the solution so in this first room we're going to jump over the sarcophagus come in here go up the stairs and then we're gonna turn right okay we're gonna come into a room with a bunch of flaming zombies i guess they're really flaming clayman which is interesting okay and then we're going to turn right again we're going to go up this set of stairs and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to drop oh i heard i it saved from before make note of this rainbow stone okay make note of that white rainbow stone all right we're going to run through this room hopefully this guy doesn't do too much damage to me okay and then we're gonna jump down and then once we do that we are going to go up the stairs we're going to turn right again so we're sort of doing the same kind of path we're going to drop this pillar okay then i'm going to show you something i'm going to take a right but this is not the correct way remember that rainbow stone i dropped in the room that looked just like this it's not here it's because it's a different room if you look we have a giant they're called like child of sin or something like that i know the exact name actually uh these are called fel twin so this is a fail twin right and he's overlooking the corpse of the one they make you think you killed the first time you were in a room that like this but it's it's a different room all right so we're gonna go back down the staircase this is the pillar that we just dropped it was breathing fire on us so we're going to hit it and ride it up we're going to come into this room we're going to turn right and then we're literally home free we're on the route to the switch right now watch out for the gargoyles going to jump over them okay i'm going to jump down here you can take the ladder just for efficiency sake i was jumping okay and then the switch will be on your right tada okay so to get back to the boss room all you're going to do is run down here and here's the boss door and then the side of grace is up those steps so the other thing that makes you think that you might be crazy is that there's two boss doors in this dungeon however only one of them requires the switch so if you find one and there's just a giant inside one of the fell twins then it's it's not really the boss room it's just a room to make you think you're crazy but that is the route through the dungeon now let's get to the boss esker priest of blood the boss is difficult but it is very weak as well the difficulty comes in the two dogs but you can dispatch those somewhat easily and i just whacked him out of the air i laughed out loud when that happened the dogs can build bleed and then pretty much everything this boss does builds bleed the swarm of flies bills bleed the sword attacks can build bleed and of course it does have a projectile that it can shoot out a little weapon art there that can build bleed as well if you have a great sword then you want to try to get them all into a corner and then just whack them once and then try to repeat the process if you do not then you want to do your best to separate the dogs from the boss but the boss is really fast and basically has infinite stamina so it's easier said than done what you can do is you can use projectiles such as firebombs or poison knives something to sort of stagger the boss and just stun it this way the boss is stuck and the dogs can come to you or you can do the exact opposite whatever you want to do but if you have a great sword or some big weapon then cornering them and then just swinging once and i don't really recommend going for a spall off swing just because the boss is way faster than you are but that's kind of the strategy that i employed but if you don't have that then just do your best to stagger the boss and get them stuck and then let the dogs come to you and do it that way and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Magma Wyrm (Mt. Gelmir) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: ixungk8v_gI
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny gage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the magma worm in mount gelmere i really dislike magma worms i'm just going to say that right off the bat you can poison magma worms which is what i was attempting to do with those poison bone darts if you are an incantations user you can also cast poison mist which i will cast throughout this fight just to kind of help whittle down his health the difficult part of this magma worm fight in particular is the terrain you are fighting him on very uneven rocks and a lot of times you can roll right into the rocks instead of rolling away from the boss so you just get stuck on him you gotta pay really really close attention to the area the other thing too is that he can get stuck on them as well while running and breathing fire so fire just ends up pulling underneath him and if you're underneath him it's almost certainly death so if you have any means to poison the boss go ahead and do so it'll help out tremendously it may not seem like it at the start because it's so slow but it lasts a long time and as you can see here we basically have the boss down to half health already and the poison is helping with that considerably i did notice that sometimes when he's able to be reposted his head actually falls into the lava go ahead and give it a try getting in there the lava won't deal too much damage to you unless you stand in it for a prolonged period of time and while you are repasting the boss you are invincible so if his head is just sort of sticking out of the lava maybe go for it anyway give it a try if it's not working after you press r1 one time just get out but you know it's definitely worth attempting because that damage is critical and it is free okay so after the boss gets below 50 hp he'll start getting into phase two here where he can roll around a bit believe it or not the role is not that hard to dodge he's not active for most of it it's really just when he sort of starts lifting up his sword and begins to swing it that's when he's active with that said if you are directly underneath the boss while he's rolling around he can sort of crush you but his general movements are not really going to do any damage to you if you're at a distance it's not until he starts swinging the sword that's when you need to start worrying about rolling that's it again poison really helps this if you have any poison daggers just go ahead and throw them poison mist whatever you got to do just poison them it helps tremendously that's the strategy i recommend for all magma worms and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Demi-Human Queen Maggie (Mt. Gelmir) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: Bo-NeI7QZQ8

hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat demi human queen maggie in mount gelmere this boss is somewhat difficult because of the terrain but she also has a couple of corollas mages around the area that will be trying to pepper you with spells so you have to be very careful the mage that is sort of crouching and sitting in the corner in the distance don't worry about that but also don't deal any damage to it i'm not 100 sure if it can be killed but it is very important for a quest so don't do any damage to the one sitting down it won't hurt you once you have the mages down uh demi human queen maggie becomes a bit easier but the terrain is pretty frustrating to deal with it's uneven jagged rocks and even if you get her on flat ground that flat ground is sloped so you are just gonna have to deal with it unfortunately throughout this fight that said if you want you can mount up on torrent maybe try to kite her back to the village a little bit that could work i'm not exactly sure where her d spawn point is but this being a field boss you are free to do that the boss has a few spells to cast however if you're staying within close range of her you're never really gonna have to worry about them they kind of can't go backwards so it's okay you saw there the boss can slam her staff into the ground if she does it horizontally not much to worry about you can just roll through it but if she does it vertically then she's going to rake it back just like that so that's one you really got to watch out for because that back brake damage is uh it's pretty pretty tough because it's going to hit you in the back you saw before that i did manage to get the boss into a repost position however because of the terrain i just was not able to do anything with it which is unfortunate but it is something you have to watch out for because it can happen to you and it's all because of this lovely terrain that we are fighting her on and you yourself you do not want to get pinched into a corner like i'm sort of trying to avoid here so just be mindful of your own surroundings and where you are i will say i don't recommend attempting to jump up these rocks because she has a habit of slamming you down while you're trying to jump up to reach her so if it's possible to sort of take the long way around and maybe try to bait her back into attacking you but that's it that's the fight you can find her here in the hermits village the way to get here is to follow the ravine in lane del and sort of loop around going north and then west and then south and then east again so you just do a big loop like i'm showing you here on the map that's how you get here it's also how you get to the magma worm uh sort of near volcano manor on the surface but that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Fallingstar Beast (Altus Plateau) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: EwQ55m3LLRE
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the falling star beast in altus plateau just outside of lane dale everyone loves a falling star beast not including me so this boss is somewhat easier than the others because you do have a bigger area to fight him in the first big one i thought was on top of mel gelmir the second one was in a mine and this third one is at least out in the open so you do have a lot of running room and you can use torrent to pretty good effect so starting off in the fight the boss will generally charge at you if you notice it clicking its pincers while they are open it is going to try to grab you so while that's happening you just want to get away from it if you're on foot you can roll through the grab but it is very fast you have to be very very careful throughout the fight you will notice that the boss will glow purple and then beneath your feet will glow purple as well and as that's happening uh spikes will come out of the ground the third time it happens though a bigger area of effect is going to get planted underneath you and it is important that you either if you're on torrent dash away very quickly or if you're on foot try to roll through it or actually run out of it if you can the difficult thing is that you can't actually tell where the entire area of effect is going to be you can only see a small portion of it wherever the camera is focused on which is usually just the center of you the area of effect does not always spawn in a perfect circle so sometimes it's quicker to run to the left so to the front of you to the back to the right it really just depends on the situation that said though this is not a full-grown falling star beast so it's phase two is non-existent you won't have to deal with all the crazy doctor strange gravity attacks it's just the same fight throughout its entirety i think only the ones with the eyeballs can uh can do that sort of stuff at least that i've noticed so it does have a couple of physical attacks as well that you got to watch out for your big sweeps just like the one you saw there just wait to roll when its head is actually moving towards you otherwise it's just cocked back and it's sort of trying to get you to panic roll it can jump for some reason and then roll towards you when that happens you want to roll to your right however if you are close enough you can roll forward but rolling to the right is always more reliable that said if you're too far away then you're almost guaranteed to get hit by it anyway so you want to try to close the gap a bit and then roll so you see here i roll to the right there you go the other thing you can do are a couple of tail swipes the tail during the swipes gets longer it actually extends out of the beast so you've got to be careful even if you feel like you're at you know good range still just roll don't try to be cute with it just get out of there so the boss doesn't appear to be weak to anything i know a lot of folks are still trying to figure that out but it doesn't appear to be weak to anything but it is susceptible to range because a lot of its attacks have long wind-ups so if you want to use some spells go for it but that's it that's how you defeat the falling star beast in altus plateau if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always also be johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Video ID: g1jMxNHWvN0
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the pair of tree sentinels on these steps leading up to lane dale capital city in altus plateau you are able to fight one of these at a time as long as you fight it here on this second level down what you want to do is as the bosses are aggroing to you they will slowly walk down and all you want to do is just take out a bow and shoot one arrow at one on the right and that one will show up the other one will just stay up on that second platform and you don't have to worry about it the trade-off here is that you have a very small area to fight them in but you should not have to worry about any of the soldiers on the ground they're pretty far away from you so you kind of have this third platform down and maybe a little bit of the fourth before those three soldiers start to notice you that said though if you'd like you can get the tree sentinel to kill them it is hostile towards other enemies so that's another way to go about it but you should be pretty familiar with tree sentinel fights by now it's one of the first bosses in the game the fight is no different and so once one goes down you have the entire staircase pretty much to fight the second one and yes even though the boss music has stopped and this one hasn't actually aggroed it still counts so you do not have to fight these at the same time once you kill the second one you will get your rewards and it's all good keep in mind though that this one cannot reflect your spells because it doesn't have a shield so if you're a magic user you may want to go after this one first this way you have more room to work with the other one because the shield can reflect those spells but that's it that's the whole fight if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll see johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the onyx lord in the sealed tunnel in altus plateau by the time i reached this boss i was quite strong so it didn't stand much of a chance at all for me i've been doing every single dungeon up until this point including all the optional ones so this thing stood no chance i will warn you though it can cast gravity magic and that can be very deadly this one however seems to have both a orb that it can throw at you but then also this backhand attack that you do need to be mindful of with the others it shares the spell to cast meteors so just be on the lookout for those they are slow moving so they shouldn't give you too much trouble when you notice its sword glowing after it slams it in the ground just put some distance between you and the boss and it will become a whole lot easier to dodge those meteors i did notice that they move in pairs so two will go to the left and then two will go to the right or vice versa once you kind of realize that it's much easier to avoid those meteors instead of trying to roll in one direction constantly and then wondering why you're getting hit it's because they're actually in two different directions so we got two to the right and then three to the left that time so they don't ever go alternate it's one group one group and then they change directions in between that's it that's the onyx lord he drops his greatsword and the entrance to the sealed tunnel can be located here it's in the outer moat of the castle or of the city i should say that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guys for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the godskin apostle in diminuela windmill village in altus plateau maybe you've fought a godskin impossible for in caled but if you haven't this one is pretty easy compared to the other one and the reason being is because you have so much room to work with that it's never an issue getting away from this guy as long as you kind of know what the attacks to look out for are so with that sweeping motion attack he can do two things with that and they look really similar but they are different he can sweep and then just sort of end it but if the sweep moves the other way like that where he goes left to right he will always start a windmill after it but the sweep where he goes right to left that one will just die on the vine as soon as the second hit lands so that windmill attack is really deadly if you are far enough away you can roll away from it however if you're too close don't attempt to roll just block the windmill will sort of push you away from him and you won't get all of your stamina drained like it won't just hit you constantly and constantly constantly it'll actually push you away and then you can back up safely okay so once the boss drops too bad 50 hp it starts to really use that godskin moniker that it has and it starts getting real stretchy this attack here you can roll through that damage i was attempting to do it there just very unsuccessful so i don't try it again the windmill attack it doesn't necessarily change he just gets another one where he can start stretching towards you believe it or not that one's actually pretty easy to avoid and you can actually roll left or right to run behind him because when he's doing that windmill his sort of torso stretch can't turn it's always going to be heading in generally one direction that direction might be slanted but it is just one direction okay so you saw there i tried again to get into that black flame swirl unsuccessful but that's okay the boss has longer combos in this phase that you want to watch out for that four hit there can be a little deadly this move here where he starts just swinging around with black flame you can roll through the first hit get in on his feet and go to work it's not that risky at all and if you get hit by the black flame it shouldn't deal too much damage to you so he does have a back strike where he is able to hit you while backing up that one's pretty tough to avoid because it looks pretty similar to other stuff but it's only one attack and it shouldn't cut you too bad all right but that's it that is how you defeat the god skin apostle again a decent amount easier since you have all this room to work with the one in k-lid you fight in a pretty small room so it gets quite challenging if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always awesome johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye-bye you

hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the sanguine noble in wrath blood ruins in altus plateau this gentleman is quite difficult and stacks bleed super fast so you have to be very very careful it is also quite dark in this area so what you should probably do is equip a lantern this way you get a little bit of light the game won't let you target folks in dark areas from far away technically because there's torches the game isn't going to do that to you but you really won't be able to see him unless you have a torch lit or your brightness is bumped all the way up but i like to play dark that's just me so every single one of this guy's attacks stacks bleed including the puddles that he puts on the ground luckily it's not scarlet rot so touching the puddles won't deal damage to you but it will build bleed and when you get full blood loss oh baby you explode so be very very careful his weapon is very fast and even though i am quite over leveled for this guy my swings are really becoming a hindrance during this fight luckily i was able to space him out there and get a full three-hit combo and do quite well but at no point during this fight did i actually feel comfortable using a two-handed weapon so i'm gonna switch to a one-handed just a regular long sword i'm going to get parried and just get destroyed that can happen if you notice that he has his hand up with a dagger in this stance that is a parry stance the odds of him pairing you right there are like 99 so don't even bother hitting him while that is happening you can cast a spell on him he won't be able to parry that but any sort of melee attack while his hands are like that no good switch to the two hand got the final hit because i saw that he was just overextending himself and that's it this boss actually took me a few tries even though i was so over leveled because of all the bleed just be very careful but this is the location of the fight in the writh blood ruins and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted the new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye bye you

Title: Godefroy the Grafted (Golden Lineage Evergaol) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: WkZnAD2OB7c
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat god freud the grafted in the golden lineage ever jail i'm just going to say this right off the bat i'm disappointed in this boss i was perfectly fine with them reusing boss models for the lesser bosses and dungeons and ever jails and even having them appear as enemies later in the game that's fine but a demigod come on this fight is the exact same as phase one of godric the grafted from stormdale castle nothing has changed that said phase two never comes about because there's no dragon for him to rip the head off of it's literally godric phase one for an entire health bar nothing else in case you forgot how to fight godric i'll take you through it he has a couple of attacks that involve the wind and when he starts using those they have a couple of different outcomes the wind can either be sent at you as a projectile he'll do that a couple times you just dodge those or he will roll around and then do a leaping attack both of them are easy enough to dodge so here he does the rolling attack with a big leap none of that is going to deal damage to you until he actually lands so you can literally stand right next to him while he's doing it he has an earthquake ability i did notice that it was the bigger earthquake from godric phase two however it's really not too much to worry about just pay attention to when his hammer is slamming into the ground and he should be okay this attack here hits five times and the last two are big overhead slams so you have to be careful for those you can try running but whenever i attempt to do that bosses always attempt to stab me in the back and they succeed so i don't recommend running i recommend just blocking and attempting to move so the earthquake can hit three times like with godric that's really the only phase two ability that he borrows everything else is mostly the same as phase one you saw there he did the big rolling attack you just roll yourself and then you can go in and get some free damage this swipe here it hits a few times you can roll through it but you do want to watch out for his left hand because it's up pretty much the entire time and then he's gonna slam it down at the end and it's a hit that you you know you can't always see coming so for that five hit attack in my opinion you don't really have enough room to move in this ever jail to get completely away from that to the point we're able to get a follow-up attack off that was just my experience i never seem to be able to get away from it but that's just me so this is pretty much the fight here and just rinse and repeat there's no phase two like i said big rolling attack you just roll yourself that's it he can sometimes do the projectiles after that but i noticed that that was way more rare than the other one so you see here the first overhead slam always seemed to hit me i could never get away from it not sure what was going on there again big rolling attack he never did the projectiles it's so rare for me to get the projectiles i actually like those because i think they have a cooler animation but it's okay so when he starts slamming his hammer into the ground if he's doing it with one hand it's gonna happen three times otherwise it's only gonna be twice so that's the tell for that if you get too much distance between you and the boss he will attempt to close the gap by doing a leaping attack not too difficult to avoid pretty easy it's pretty slow and deliberate so here comes the five hit overhead again i'm never able to dodge this thing but that's just me all right so here are the projectiles he finally did them he does them twice you just roll through them no big deal here comes the super earthquake with the third hit you got to be really far away from that to not take any damage you can roll through those or just block them whatever you want to do it's up to you but after a little while his health bar is depleted and he goes down the crazy thing is that this guy actually has lore if you read the talisman description that you loot the godfrey icon if you read that it actually refers to this boss which is just strange but that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Omenkiller & Miranda the Blighted Bloom (Perfumer's Grotto) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring

Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for eldon ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat omen killer and miranda the blighted bloom in perfumer's grotto in altus plateau quite the name so this boss isn't too difficult if you have decent poison resistance gear or the ability to cure poison either by using boluses or the incantation that will help a great deal i think i was pretty over leveled for this area although the cave itself gave me a little bit of trouble so i was kind of shocked at how little health omen killer had that said fighting omen killers is a pretty tricky affair but there is one move that you can just exploit over and over and over on them whenever they do their triple jump double cleaver slam attack you can backstab them after the third attack every single time so if you just want to play it safe against an omen killer and not go in too often and if you're just not feeling comfortable fighting them and getting in their face just hold up your shield and wait for them to start jumping at you because when they do three jumps after that third one you have a year and a day to backstab them so that's it that's the whole fight and that's my tips for omen killer they are pretty scary but as long as you know what you can exploit and what you can't it gets a lot easier that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guys for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'm sweet johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Video ID: WgQl0gBfCNs
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the ancient hero of zamor in the sainted heroes grave in altus plateau long introduction you've probably fought one of these before there was one locked in an ever jail in the weeping peninsula but if you haven't that's okay pretty much all of its attacks are parable i'm just god awful at pairing an elden ring for some reason really good at it in dark souls but just not good at an elden ring not sure what my problem is but the boss doesn't have too much poise however it does have a quick recovery time so even though i am using a big two-handed greatsword and i'm going to hit it once and it's going to get staggered not a full stagger to sort of put to its knees it recovers extremely fast so it can always counter attack with that snap and even though you're going to do decent amount of damage to it you have to be careful because if you are high on your frostbite meter you're gonna get frostbitten and then you're gonna get slowed down so you don't want that to happen so if you are using a big weapon only hit her once don't go in for more attacks just do your best to just sort of whittle the health bar down if you are using a regular weapon or if you're using magic you kind of have a bit more to work with what i've noticed is if you're using a one-handed sword because you are not doing a lot of poise damage to the boss the boss won't do that snap counter attack at least as frequently so in phase two the boss gets a lot more frost attacks it's always enchanting its weapon with frost so you kind of can't get away from it the boss does have a few abilities that extend frost damage to you you saw one right there where the boss stuck its weapon into the ground and then a frost geyser came out that's when you really got to be careful of i've noticed that that's a change compared to the one that was locked in the evergel back in the weeping peninsula so this is sort of the fight doesn't do too much else i keep trying to parry and just failing miserably i don't know what my problem is but the boss can still do that cold snap in your face so you have to watch out for that i like to compare this boss to dancer at the boreal valley in dark souls 3. a lot of big sweeping movements delayed hits a lot to watch out for you just want to keep a close eye on its hand and when its hand starts moving towards you that's when it's actually going to deal damage the boss is able to put a pattern of frost on the ground when that happens it's gonna go out in a cone shape so you want to just run away from it the closer you are to the boss the less far you have to run but if you are far away from the boss and you're gonna have more ground to cover so once you see it start sort of coming out you want to start moving otherwise you can get trapped in it and it will deal damage to you once the boss goes down you will get the ancient dragon knight spirit ash and that's it here's the entrance to the grave it is in altus plateau like i said that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guys for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always also johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Ancient Dragon Lansseax (Altus Plateau) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: hrAPDJRhZZA
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat ancient dragon lancy that's how i'm choosing to pronounce it maybe it's land seeks i don't know go with lancy this boss may have harassed you back when you first reach altus plateau by climbing up the ruin strewn precipice however it actually moves closer to lanedale capital city and i'll show you the location of the boss at the end of the video so this dragon shares a lot of moves with a lot of dragons however it does have some unique things that it only shares with its sibling dragon which is a hidden boss fight i do have a guide for it on my channel so all these lightning attacks can be very deadly and can almost one shot you most of the time it has a few things that it can do the main thing that you'll notice is that occasionally it will fly up in the air and create a sword with lightning and then when it has that in its hand you want to do your best to put some distance between you and the boss and then you want to either jump over it when it swings or you can get close to the boss so it goes over your head it really depends on the terrain where you are and what side of the slope you're on if you are up on the slope and the boss is technically below you even though it is flying you should be able to jump over the sword but if the boss is above you on the slope then you'll likely just want to run underneath it or just roll if you're on foot so that's the sword right there you see the arc that it sends out it does go for quite the distance so if you are far enough away from the boss you'll be able to jump over the ark and maybe not have to worry so much about the sword but it really depends on the situation i highly highly recommend taking this fight on torrent and not trying to do it on foot you're in the field so it's easy enough all right so that's slam right there that one is not too difficult to avoid um it does send out a shock wave very similar to the sword so we should be getting the sword here in a moment lance is going to breathe fire what i will say is with this boss in particular or this dragon in particular the fire breath starts closer to the boss's right than any other dragon fight so if you remember ag heal you're able to just stand next to the boss's face while it breathes fire and just attack it and attack it and then you know it's no big deal but for this you specifically want to move back towards its neck towards its shoulders pretty much otherwise you can get clipped by the fire and die it will almost certainly knock you off of torrent and expose you to a big follow-up attack sometimes you get lucky and the boss is too slow to recognize what's going on you know if that happens great just revive torrent start moving again but a lot of the time you will just get stepped on or something and die so this is the boss flying up here if you notice that fire is coming out of its mouth it's going to breathe fire and that's your cue to get away the animation between that and lancy taking out the sword is that one there's no flame but if you're far enough away it's hard to tell the other difference is that when the dragon is going to take out the sword it sort of snakes its neck a little bit and then it's going to pull out the sword so if you don't notice that that neck's snaking and it's just going straight up in the air then it's fire otherwise it's the sword but that's it once the boss goes down you get lancy's glaive incantation which allows you to use the sword in some sense i'll let you discover that on your own but that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for eldon ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the draconic tree sentinel guarding the gates to lane dale capital city out here in altus plateau both the horse and the sentinel on the horse are draconic the horse can breathe fire and the guy on the horse can summon lightning so you have to be very very careful with this boss i actually don't recommend fighting this one on torrent because it's very difficult to get away from some of its abilities on the horse when it's a lot easier to just roll through them so the fireball you can either roll to the side or just roll through it the hitbox on it is not that big although it does kind of last a little while so the physical attacks that the boss has although it doesn't use them too often are these big lumbering swings with its great hammer the trick with those though is that the hook on it can basically hit you from behind this ability here where the boss lifts up its shield and slams it down or pulls it down and casts lightning the tell for that is a little bit tricky you want to roll once the boss pulls its hand all the way down so not as it's starting to pull its hand down but rather when it starts to reach the end of the animation so not at the very start but more towards the end it's a little difficult to time i didn't get it every single time even though i kind of knew what to look for but just pay attention to the shield and then as it's reaching the bottom of that animation that's when you roll so you can sort of start rolling as the hand is moving you just don't want to do like an anticipatory roll or roll like the millisecond it starts moving it is kind of tricky that's why i'm spending so much time talking about it other than that the boss doesn't really have too much else going on it does have a scoop ability that summons a bunch of lightning and then a slam that will bring down a big lightning bolt but after that things should calm down a bit it's not sparking with electricity the whole time the hammer is no longer electrified but it can still bring down the lightning with the shield even if the boss isn't glowing with electricity so just be aware of that but as you can see fighting this guy on foot is not as bad as you might think it's really really not that bad so once the boss gets struck by lightning again it will start doing the shield lightning bolts as well as the slam lightning bolts so just look out for it if i remember correctly during the 20 minute gameplay demo that was shown last year there was a lot more going on including lightning that was hitting the ground in like a storm that doesn't seem to be a thing in the full release of the game and i'm not sure why i'm not sure if maybe i just didn't see it maybe it's an ability that only comes out in co-op like they had in the in the gameplay demo that they showed really not sure if you ran into that move please let me know because i'm wondering what happened to it or maybe i'm crazy and it never existed in the first place but once the boss goes down you will get the hammer and shield and then you can enter the city proper and boy what a treat that is but that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for eldon ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the death bird in lane dale although technically it's still altus plateau but this is behind the exterior castle wall for lane dell this boss is supposed to only appear at night at least that's the working theory right now however i was able to get this one to appear pretty much all the time so it's a little unclear what time exactly this boss will show up but i died a couple times and i changed the time of day still showed up so maybe this is technically night within the capital wall i'm not really sure so the boss itself is a giant bird with a staff clearly i recommend however not fighting this boss on horseback the reason being because its staff is so long and it is able to cover ground very quickly so quick in fact that full speed torrent sprints may not be enough to get away from it and you may end up getting blasted off of torrent anyway so eventually about halfway through this fight in a second here i'm going to just get off the horse and do it myself the reason being is because it's easier to roll through the boss's abilities than it is to try to outrun it the other reason is that you may run into other enemies most notably the rolling skulls in this field area so again this may just be easier for you to get off the horse i am primarily using a two-handed great sword here however if you're going to be using a big lumbering weapon like that i don't recommend attempting to do full combos all the time because that can happen the boss has a lot of attacks where it can hit directly underneath it it can peck at you sort of like the giant crows in k-lid very similar but then it also has a slam with its staff so you have to be careful with that the peck albeit funny can deal quite a bit of damage and just interrupt anything you're trying to do so standing directly underneath it without moving too much without rolling a decent amount is not a good idea so if you're a caster try to get some distance but don't go too far because it can just poke you with a staff and deal a lot of damage and if you're melee don't stand under it too long without changing up your position but that's it that's the fight if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Crucible Knight Duo (Ordovis) (Auriza Hero's Grave) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring 4k HDR
Video ID: vwK9C9TRnqQ
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for eldon ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the pair of crucible knights in oriza hero's grave this has got to be one of the most difficult mini dungeon boss fights so far in the game that i've encountered one crucible knight is enough two is just overkill what you want to try to do at least the strategy that i employed that i recommend is you want to try to kill the regular crucible knight the one with the spear first this is not an easy task because these guys are best friends and always want to be together it is very difficult to get them to leave one another's sides it's like two puppies swear to god so the attacks that you have to look out for are numerous there's so much going on in this fight because you have two of these guys to deal with but if you've been following along with all these guides and going through the game as i have this will not be your first tango with either of these types of crucible knights so the first one is basically the same as the first ever gel that you came across back in limb grave if you can even remember it back that far and the spear one you may have run into in deep root depths okay so for the spear crucible knight it has a lot of stabs and a couple of sweeping attacks from what i have noticed it's sort of never done with its combos unless of course it hits you then it seems to stop on a dime but you want to be careful of the quick stab that it has and all these attacks are parable but i was not even going to try to parry this thing because of the stab it just dealt so much damage i didn't want to expose myself okay so the sweep attacks that it has it can do them either in short bursts or long sweeping attacks so depending on where its hands are on the spear that kind of dictates where things are going it is actually animated properly where if the hands are towards the back of the spear it's going to be a long sweep but if they are positioned to where the hands are split and one is in the front it's going to be more of a stab so you saw there before it used one of its what's called an angelic ability i'm not really sure the exact name but it has the ability to shoot a projectile at you from the spear itself in order to roll through that you just want to pay attention to the spear itself and once the spear begins to move towards you that is when you dodge its wing attack however is quite different from every other crucible knight because for the spear crucible knights it does a downward lunge it doesn't just fly through you holding its weapon so with that in mind you do need to just roll either into it to get some follow-up damage when it's diving toward you or you can roll out of the way and then sort of reposition yourself see here it comes again we're just going to block it that time because i just wasn't i knew i wasn't going to be able to react in time so that's the projectile easy enough to dodge what i've noticed is that once one of them hits phase two and starts getting these angelic abilities the other one just gets more aggressive so i don't know if it's actually like that or if my mind was just going crazy because i was trying these guys for over an hour but that's how it seemed to me so i'm rolling back there just so i don't also get hooked up by ordovis in the back because again they're like puppies they're always together so you got to be careful the spear crucible knight also has another angelic ability where its hand becomes a dagger and that attack is a grab and it can basically one shot you even if you're at full health so you have to be very very careful of that attack it's easy enough to roll through but if you mistime it it's a ton of damage so again throughout this fight you constantly have to manage your spacing from ordovis because his sword has a special attack and you will get the sword at the end of this fight don't worry if you hold l2 he will spin it or if he holds l2 i should say he will spin the sword and slam it into a big earthquake and he can do that throughout the fight even if he's not in phase two with the rest of his angelic abilities so he's got to be very very careful and make sure that you are not going in for too many hits on the spear knight before hordovis closes the gap that's really the whole fight so for that dagger stab i actually recommend rolling backwards this way the dagger goes through you and you can follow up for at least one hit along the way so once the first knight goes down or dovis becomes the boss so he doesn't do any crazy transformations outside of you know what you may have already seen from regular crucible nights with the sword and shield but he just becomes so much more aggressive because now you killed his puppy friend and he wants vengeance so all of his attacks have really lengthy follow-ups so you always have to be mindful of where his weapon is because even with his big two-handed attacks he can follow that up with some pretty devastating sweeps and they seem to just like be never ending sometimes to be very careful here i am trying to foolishly parry and he dropped me to about 15 health so don't try to parry unless you are really good at parrying an elden ring i am not you would have noticed once i got hordovis alone i put some distance between me and the boss i ran away for a while and then i popped a rune arc to activate godric's great rune this boosts my stats including my health stamina and fp the reason for this is because like i said i've been doing this fight for about an hour to an hour and a half and i had gotten him low several times but would just die to like the perfect amount of damage so again i mean death row is your fault most of the time in elden ring i should say unless it's the camera or something it's generally because of something you messed up but it seemed like he was just always getting just enough damage to where had i had popped the runark and gotten that bonus maybe i wouldn't have died and that really was the difference maker for me is having a great arc or a great rune active using a rune arc so for that spin attack you can roll through it however it hits very late and the shock wave lasts a decent amount of time so you have to be very very careful with how you choose to roll for me i generally recommend to just avoid it because that shock wave can lead to a lot of follow-up damage his flying attack is basically the same as the rest of the crucible knights that have a sword and shield not too much to worry about there but like the crucible knight in the ever jail in storm hill in limgrave he does have the tail attacks so to refresh you on those tail attacks he has one short one that he seems to do all the time when you're close range and you're trying to get damage on him he just seems to use that as like a like a posture breaker like sort of like a rhythm breaker almost and then he has a big double slam that you have to be a big double tail swipe that you got to look out for they do have two different tells though when he does the single he starts from his left he sort of sticks his butt out to the left and then he swipes to the right for the double it's the opposite he starts on the right and then uh flips to the left so this is the single he starts from his left goes to the right the big one is from the right to the left so just keep that in mind it's a little difficult to tell like in the moment i know you're not trying to look at this guy's hips but hey maybe you are who knows but those are the tells for the tail swipes so if you're able to get to just ordovis i would say this fight becomes a lot easier the only frustration is that you can't really lay into him you can't get too much damage on him because of this tail swipe he's always using it to interrupt you and making sure that he can only get one hit on him at a time and he just has so much poise that it's basically impossible to stagger this guy like i said though he is parriable so if you're feeling confident go for the parries it is a sword so it's easy enough to see but you always want to be on the lookout for those tail swipes no matter your distance they can't cover the entire room but they get pretty close so just do your best to dodge appropriately and that is it that is the double crucible knight fight for your troubles you will get the full crucible knight set alongside ordovic's greatsword the entrance to this dungeon is all the way over here very close to the cliff face so be on the lookout for that but it's a it's pretty far away from where you actually end up fighting the boss but that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if

Title: Fell Twins (Leyndell, Capital City) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: wtqoL3PfmXw
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the fel twins in lane dale capital city technically the capital outskirts but you cannot get here until after you defeated morgot so your this area is not accessible until you do that and morgot is the second and main boss of the capital city so this is just a side area but inaccessible until you actually beat the main boss of the area okay so you have fought these enemies before for sure especially if you have been down to the subterranean shunning grounds underneath the city however fighting two of them at the same time is a nightmare one of the tricks to this fight is lighting so you want to give yourself as much light as possible especially when it comes to the second boss this has to be fought somewhat similarly to four kings in dark souls 1. you want to get as much distance between the bosses as possible luckily the second twin the really big one with looks like a monstrosity with things crawling out of it luckily that one does not do too much unless you get close to it so if you notice it in the background and it's creeping ever closer ever closer what you want to do is just run away these twin monsters can't chase you i mean they can run but they kind of can't catch up to you unless they are in their grab animation the grab animation is quite fast so you gotta be on the lookout for that when these guys go to do their big lunge punch you can just roll backwards and then it exposes them to a backstab it's like perfect timing for the grab if you already have distance then what you can do is just run away and chances are they won't catch up to you but it is such a delayed grab that it's so difficult to judge when it's actually coming for you all right so for the second one i'm going to use a runark activate godric's great rune increase my stats a bit and then you may have noticed during that first fight i equipped the lantern so i have that on my quick bar and equipping the lantern is especially useful in phase two reason being this guy doesn't have a red glowing axe to keep track of most of the time after you've done a little bit of damage to him his sword will be glowing gold but it's not exactly helpful for lighting because it can go away so having the lantern enabled allows you to see a lot better during this fight especially in the opening seconds you saw there he got some ways away from me and he went dark had i not had my lantern equipped that would have happened a lot sooner when he was a lot closer to me so having the lantern is like it's not a it's not going to solve the problems of this fight for you it's not going to win it for you but it will let you have as much information as necessary to win okay so the actual strategy for this guy once you're used to the lighting and the movement and everything he uses a lot of big lumbering attacks he does have some combos but for the most part he's just going to do one or two hits and then be done with it he shares pretty much all the same moves as the first one with the exception of the magical abilities that are somehow being cast out of these maybe slugs or something that are coming out of them not really sure maybe it's dragon parts maybe who knows but when he explodes like this you're gonna get about nine of these balls to start chasing you so once you notice him to start exploding you want to actually run away from him to put as much distance between you and those orbs as possible they are slow moving which means that when you roll through them even though you've rolled through them you may be on the tail end of their hurt box so they may deal damage to you as you come out of the roll when he slams his sword on the ground orbs will come out as well so as long as the sword is glowing you always need to be on the lookout for those orbs they kind of come out of different attacks a lot that explosion whenever he slams his sword on the ground he can breathe in quick succession he can do it up to three times easy enough to roll through if you're close enough but it is a fan or a cone formation so the further away you are the harder it is to avoid because one it's a long breath so if you roll through it chances are you might get clipped on the back end and because it's a fan if you roll left or right you may uh get clipped because you just don't have enough room to roll so it is a little difficult to deal with the sword itself even though you may have a 100 physical block rating shield with this enemy in particular this fell twin that enchantment can still deal damage so even though you're blocking keep paying attention to your health bar because it may be getting whittled down but that's it that's the fight once you defeat them you have access to the divine tower you can activate more god's great rune and then move on to the next area i mean you can move on to the next area without doing this but this is like the last thing to do in the city and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please

Title: Giants' Mountaintop Catacombs Maze Solution & Ulcerated Tree Spirit Boss Fight Guide - Elden Ring
Video ID: 1BBV6YyPGgM
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to not only get through giant's mountaintop catacombs but also defeat the boss which is an ulcerated tree spirit okay we're going to start from the point of grace however everything in my run here is already dead so we are just going to take the critical path through this maze and then unlock the boss door so this dungeon sort of has this weird thing to it where you're gonna be running through literally the same rooms but they're actually on different levels so you're gonna get to rooms and feel like wait did the enemies respawn somehow or do they put in new enemies did they load into enemies like what's happening it's just a maze it's a deliberate puzzle maze so it's not that you're going crazy it's just that you're made to think you're going crazy okay so following this path from the door we're going to take this lift down now the previous lift if you want it in the previous lift you can actually wait for that elevator to go back up and then ride it down and get some treasure down there but i'm not going to do that in this video but that is what you can do okay so we're going to come up to this statue and then we're going to turn right go up this set of stairs and then we're going to turn left at this hallway watch out for the trap okay and we're gonna make it into a room with blades so we're gonna run through here and then we're gonna enter this room and we're gonna turn left okay up the set of stairs up another set of stairs and then we're gonna be in an l-shaped room and then we're going to turn go into the next room up the stairs and then in this next room there's going to be a hole that we can drop down and then i'm actually going to make a tiny mistake and correct it very quickly but i'm going to start walking up this staircase dead ahead of me realize i made a mistake and turn around very good john okay so we're going to walk down this hallway and there will be a lift here but you want to send the lift up and then once you drop down you got to be careful because there will be a giant pot to be careful of that don't fall off the ledges okay then you're just going to walk straight through and the switch is in this room and i will show you how to get from here back to the boss room because that's also a tiny bit confusing so once you've hit the switch you want to run this way and then it may not really look like it but we are going to be retreading ground here so we're going to ride this lift up and then we're just going to run straight through once we reach the top very good all right go ahead and run straight through and up the stairs and then eventually we're going to reach the boss room there you go okay so with that out of the way let's get to the boss strategy chances are you have fought several ulcerated tree spirits by this point of the game so this should be somewhat familiar to you but you are fighting it in quite a small room which can be frustrating so the boss starts right off with a bang by slamming its head into the ground always fun whipping it around making me waste flasks right at the jump right out the gate so here comes the tail swipe you can always roll through that it does sort of delay the tail swipe though so make sure you don't roll until the tail is actually moving towards you so with this roar it'll do this big leap attack and then it will typically follow that up either with a breath or some hand slams either one for the breath that it follows up with you can actually just stand right underneath the boss and go for it so yep right here same thing you just get underneath the boss or to the side and start getting in some really good damage okay with this uh whenever it slams its face on the ground it's tough to manage but if you're ever able to get damage onto its head that will build a ton of stagger so you can always try to aim for the head and then you will be able to get a big riposte which does a lot of damage to the boss it's tough to do but it may be worth it if you're fighting it from a distance okay so once you notice it glowing you want to run away as quickly as possible and then you want to avoid the flame geysers that spawn on the ground those flame geysers can spawn with another attack that we'll see in a minute so you got to be careful of that while the boss is glowing you won't take damage from standing near it it's not like smelter demon from dark souls 2 where you just take proximity damage it's nothing like that so you can always just sit next to it okay so this is the big flame geyser attack it will explode itself and then geysers will spawn on the ground so you got to watch out for both of those don't stand next to the boss while that's happening otherwise you will take damage pretty much no matter what okay and that's basically the fight because the same thing's over and then the fight continues so you got to watch out for that head whip that one's a little deceptive because it just seems like it's sort of rolling around and then it suddenly whips its head at you got to be careful for that it does have a grab this is it you got to watch out for that just roll pretty late and then you shouldn't get hooked up i have rolled and not taken initial damage from it but then gotten grabbed anyway so it's a little tricky okay so it's main point of damage taking will be its stomach like i said if you can aim for the face do so otherwise you won't be able to hit it okay so it does have that two-handed slam and actually just this second notice that that looks like vicar amelia it's probably the same animation that's crazy i never noticed that until this moment i mean who cares we're using animation if it means making a cool looking boss like this but man that's funny all right so one more hit the boss will go down we'll get a fancy jump strike i love ending boss fights like that we'll go down you'll get a golden seed as well as a glove wart pickers bell bearing number two that you can give to the statue in round table hold and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my

Title: Death Rite Bird (Mountaintops of the Giants) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: Gij7XpwtTuU
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the death right bird located in the mountain tops of the giants this is very close to the mausoleum that you'll hear ringing around in the area so this boss is pretty interesting it's no different than other death birds with the exception that this one can cast pretty cool necromancy spells but its physical attacks and patterns are pretty much all the same so if you're familiar with death birds if you run into them then this shouldn't be too much of an issue i also want to say that these bosses are only supposed to show up at night but i've had two now show up during the day so i'm not sure if it's just a little bugged or if the ones that i've run into are just special death birds who knows okay so throughout this fight the boss can use necromancers which are really the things you gotta look out for it has a big explosion and when that goes off it will leave a trail of fire on the ground that lingers for quite a bit of time at least until starts flying around again so if the boss is nearby go ahead and attack it but if you're gonna have to go through fire to get to it i recommend just waiting healing up getting your bearings reducing any frostbite that you might have if you want to get rid of it and then waiting for the boss to come to you so the other attack the boss has is it can send out necromantic daggers at you from its wings so the wings are really cool to look at but when they start glowing a special color that means that the daggers are coming so you got to watch out for that all you really got to do for those is just back away and then you should be completely fine the fact that this is an undead enemy and i'm using the coded sword means that i'm going to be dealing a ton of damage to it with what is effectively a long sword that you may not so this may last a little bit longer for you than it does for me but if you are a faith build the coded sword is available in lane dell i highly recommend you go get it so this is the dagger attack i was talking about has a very clear tell and what you want to do is just look out on the ground white circles will appear where the daggers are going to land just don't be in the general vicinity and you should be fine the boss can just put fire on the ground and then it'll fly towards you so just don't stand in that lane of fire and you should be okay and after a little while the boss goes down i do not recommend fighting death birds while on torrent you're setting yourself up for disaster because the boss can move a whole lot faster than you and torrent can get stuck in the fire on the ground and not be able to jump out so you're better off just fighting it on foot yourself and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alert of a new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always also johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Video ID: aID92f2zT5E
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat black blade kindred in the forbidden lands this boss is guarding the lift of rolls you got to defeat it to get through okay so the boss is a twin blade gargoyle however it also has a one-handed axe that it can use to great effect i recommend if you have any weapons that are enchanted with anything maybe switch to a weapon that is purely physical damage for the simple reason that basically made out of stone and a faith weapon or you know an intelligence weapon really aren't going to do much so your best bet is just straight physical damage i also recommend having a quicker weapon rather than a slower weapon reason being that with gargoyle fights like this the boss can attack very quickly and you don't really have many opportunities to deal successive damage so if you can time it perfectly maybe you can get one lumbering swing of a great sword but you're better off just leveling up a one-handed weapon if you haven't already you should have plenty of upgrade materials by this point to make one and then going in with that one of the other things that this boss has is one it has a roar but similar to the roar and the big sweeping axe attack where it creates a whirlwind that sort of has like a blood flame component to it where if you get caught up in the wind of that attack you will take ticking damage even after the attack is done so it's not building your bleed meter or anything but it is dealing ticking damage from the flame so sort of like a dot other than that this is probably not the first gargoyle fight you've you've had unless you're just mainlining the story of the game but with the twin blade you want to look after its big sweeping motions if you stay close to the boss then you won't really have to worry about the big sweeping motions very few of them will actually connect to you when you are underneath the boss really only one of them maybe so as long as you stay like actually behind the boss's feet while it is doing those big sweeping attacks those big whirlwind attacks you're probably totally fine so for the most part you have plenty of space to fight the boss if you'd like to even go back up on the snow you can do that but there's really nothing in the terrain blocking you from rolling so fighting it on this level of the steps or of the ramp is just fine but that's it the ball will go down and then you can use the lift of rolled if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the link for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye-bye you

hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for eldon ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down borealis the freezing fog and the mountain tops of giants this takes place on the big frozen lake about halfway through the zone this is your typical dragon fight however you do need to look out for a special kind of breath and a special kind of stump which produces frostbite so you have to be very careful of that all the breath attacks produce frostbite so if you have any of the boluses to cure that go ahead and bring some along unfortunately you cannot craft items during a boss fight so you have to do it before you actually engage the boss other than the new breath the only other thing to look out for is when the boss does a really big stomp i'm talking like really long charge time on the stomp that when the foot lands it will deal frost damage so you do have to be careful that it'll happen a couple times here in the recording so we'll see it soon other than that the boss can fly up and then just slam down on you you should be careful about that you have plenty of room to work with in this uh in this arena here so don't be afraid to just run away and sort of re-engage the boss when you get a chance of course if you hit it in the head enough times you will get a good amount of stagger damage and then you can get a full-on pass on the boss so this stomp here where the boss is a full stretch out that is where the frost comes in she still does still have the stomp where it doesn't happen just a quick stomp don't worry about frost on that but if it's a long one you gotta look out for the frost when the boss screams that will also deal frost so if you're underneath the boss she can scream and then you will just take a bunch of frost damage so if you feel like you do not have a clean exit so like i didn't right there somehow i clipped through the tail but i would not have planned to do that but if you feel like you don't have a good exit from out underneath the boss just get away reposition and start again there's no harm in just running away from this boss for a second to get your bearings and sort of like a rule of thumb in these games in general because it's open world so she does have a tail swipe and from what i've noticed i don't know if my positioning was just like perfect for it to happen but it seemed a bit longer than other tail swipes from other dragons i'm not really sure what's going on with that but i did get clipped on the back end of a tail swipe that was kind of weird so that stomp there that's the one you got to look out for for the frost but other than that it's pretty much your standard dragon fight you can stagger i've never gotten two staggers on a dragon boss before but it could be because my weapon's at plus nine and maybe i hadn't fought dragons at plus nine i'm not really sure but i was just able to get a lot of head shots in which is not typical for me but we'll end it with a nice critical and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye-bye i deliberately tried to drag this out so it would show my stats i had no idea when this would end i'll see you later bye-bye you

Title: Erdtree Avatar (Mountaintops of the Giants) - EASY STRATEGY - Full Narrated Guide - Elden Ring
Video ID: ekbLpuR3j6I
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring this time I'm going to show you how to take down the her tree Avatar in mountain tops of the Giants this urry Avatar is the same as all the other ones with the critical difference that it can split itself in two and the Clone does not have a any sort of weakness it shares the same exact health bar as the boss so when that happens I'm going to employ a strategy that I have no shame in telling you how to employ yourself and that is to just run away let the boss reset although the Clone will still be very active but it will start walking away and then you can just engage one of them kill it and then the boss is dead although there is a weird happen stance I don't know if it was a glitch or something at the very end that you'll see that it may just require one extra hit after the boss health bar disappears to maybe count for killing the Clone I have no idea but all the boss's abilities are the exact same with the exception of this right here so when the ball starts glowing it will clone itself while that's happening it does have a bit of armor but you can just keep wailing on it and you'll actually deal a lot of stagger damage so when this is happening we are just going to run away try to get away as fast as possible even though the Earth tree avatars are big they can close the gap pretty fast and their Hammer can one shot torrrent so you have to be very very careful but we're just running away you you can use the trees to block these Stars that's very helpful because you don't have a lot of angle room here and around this area there's going to be a lot of demihumans so even though the Boss music has stopped the boss health bar is gone they are still following me so I take a minute here just to kind of kill some Demi humans I'm hoping that they start going away um but I was thinking just in case I need to kite one of the bosses over here I don't want to get interrupted while that's happening so just kill any demihumans in the area and then by the time you're done the bosses should have walked away you see here they were still facing me which means that they probably were still looking for me for a little bit but they've separated pretty far apart the one on the left is all the way in the distance now so I'm going to start fighting this one here and the other one is just going to keep walking away it never notices me so maybe for you maybe wait a little bit longer cuz re-watching this footage now it really was quite close when I re-engaged the boss but in any event you see that the boss health bar is right where I left it and so now it's just a one-on-one again and you may be under a bit of a soften rage here the second boss May notice you again start chasing after you if that's the case I'm sure you could just run away again I doubt it' be a problem but yeah just try to kill it as quickly as possible and then you're good to go this should be like your 10th her tree Avatar that you fought bought at this point see here it does the clone spell again but the other one is still in the distance so it's a little glitched like maybe there can only be two active at a time or something but you see in the distance again just underneath the hammer the other one was dying but it's still required an extra hit here so this is a bit of a cheese strategy I have no shame in doing this because I died like three or four times to both of these things and I just can't imagine they really expect you to fight two of these things at once but anyway you get a couple Crystal tiers for your efforts here is the boss on the map you do have to go kind of all the way around although you can actually just jump up from the bonfire and cross the bridge not bonfire side of Grace you know what I mean and then fight them there but I use the coded sword plus 9 and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for Elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on Twitter and join my Discord links for those are in the description below as always I'll swich on cage thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye-bye

Title: Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble (Spiritcaller's Cave) - Full Narrated Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: YVdYYrE4SLg
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the godskin apostle and noble in the spirit colors cave in the mountaintops of giants i'm going to start off by saying that i don't know if you are able to just find the spirit collar snail and kill it and end this fight in two seconds i genuinely have no idea i kind of don't think so because in the other spear collar snail fight way back earlier on in the game you were able to see the snail and attack it you sort of see like a shadow of it and it was glowing so it's obvious i do think that you are supposed to fight both the god skin bosses for this and then after that the snail does appear automatically so let me know if you're able to find it but don't waste too much time on it in any event the apostle and the noble are normal fights they do not have any new abilities other than the ones that you may have seen if you did fight them earlier on you can find them in volcano manor and divine tower of caled as well as the lane dell area in altus plateau so the apostle moves very quickly and he has a staff that has a hook and then he can also stab with the butt end of it and it's quite deadly you can attempt to get in on his attacks however they're very long and very sweeping and because of the hook on the back of his weapon he is able to kind of cut you on the back end without even noticing so i don't really recommend rolling into him too often only on very specific attacks that jump strike being one of them you are totally safe rolling into that you're gonna roll past him and then you just turn around get a hit in the other name of the game with the apostle and even the noble to some extent is just get one or two hits in unless you get perfect rolling on that jump and then if you do you can get three when he hits about 50 hp he's gonna get all stretchy and he has some more black flame abilities like this one just run away from that one he still has this fireball you can roll through that and if you're close enough get a stab in here's what i meant before you try to roll through his combos but they're just so long and they can always clip you on the back end so you have to be careful the whipping black flame ability you can get in on that if you roll through the first one you can get a ton of damage on him i will do it here in the video this windmill when you get in on him if you want to go for it un-target the boss because you are targeting the boss's upper torso for the most part and so what's going to happen is you're actually going to be tracking the part of the body that's extended and not his legs so if you're targeting him and you get in on the windmill and you start pressing r1 over and over you're only going to hit him once or twice whereas if you untarget him you'll get your full combo when you do one target him though you got to be careful of the camera so here's that whipping black flame ability no problem if you start all the way in on him you don't even have to roll no big deal that stab into a hook back that one is quite tough to learn how to dodge what you want to do is you want to block the first hit and then roll through the second one and you should be perfectly safe throughout this uh portion of the fight however the boss can still do the standing windmill if you are getting sort of clipped by the standing windmill i recommend simply blocking for a little bit you will take a ton of posture damage or stamina damage but you will get pushed out from the boss and so you won't actually you shouldn't die from it unless you're just point blank in his face once the apostle goes down you have a bit of time at that stage and during the break i recommend popping a rune arc activating your great rune increasing your stats reason being that the noble although slower has more devastating single hit attacks he also has a rapier that he can go kind of buck wild with and he can very quickly drain your stamina even with a great rune active i mean each hit even though i have a 100 physical block shield one hit is draining about 15 to 20 percent stamina off of my shield so you got to be careful there the major ability that you go watch out for is that one he can do two things when he puts his rapier above his head he can either just do one big lunge or if you notice him holding it for a really extended period of time he's gonna do a big combo of major strikes the last one of which you can roll through successfully and get a bunch of damage on him you do not want to try to get in his face and deal a bunch of damage reason being that he can always sort of do not a parry but sort of like a deflection of you while doing damage it's just sort of like a sweeping hand motion you always have to be on the lookout for those he shares the same black flame fireball as the apostle so same sort of strategy there but what the boss ends up doing is this he puts the ring of fire around him like johnny cash and then we'll cast the fireball and that's a little hard to see in the fireball because the ring of flame is the same color it's all the same effect so you got to be careful for some reason this boss also has a tail and a tail swipe so if you notice that you are behind the boss you have like a 90 chance of getting tail swiped so don't get comfortable there he has this skull crusher move with the butt end of his sword if you notice that he is holding his hand for an extended period of time generally after a combo it's going to be one big skull crusher however if he does one quickly he will always follow up with the second one and you can get in after the second one for the ring of fire you always want to back up it's not worth trying to get in there to like the two pixels that you have to work with to deal damage just get out let your stamina refill by dropping your guard dodge the fireball that's almost certainly going to come and then you'll be okay once the boss hits about 50 60 health he will turn into phase two and then he turns into a giant marshmallow this attack can be rolled through however you want to roll to the right and it's kind of difficult when you should roll so we do it successfully there but i really clip through him so i think what's happening is that his middle section is the hurt box along with his feet but i can't be sure i've only this is only the second one that i fought and it's a little hard to tell what the actual hurt box is on that but it can be rolled through i know in my original guide back in volcano manor i mentioned to use pillars obviously you don't have pillars in this fight so you do have to learn how to roll through it so that is the extended skull crusher smash i was talking about he held his hand up for a really long period of time and then slammed it down it's just one hit this is the double it's a lot quicker you can always get damage on the double when he does the black flame sort of inflation you want to be careful because black flame abilities deal damage after they've hit you it has like a ticking dot on it that lasts a couple seconds but in those couple seconds it can deal a significant amount of damage so you have to be careful so even if you roll back from the first skull crusher you can roll in for the second one but just pay attention to your stamina meter because that's two roles in a strike and that could be a significant amount of stamina for you if you don't have an adequate amount for this fight so just be very careful you will notice that when the boss's rapier starts to almost look like penetrator from the original version of demon souls where it's just sort of like has a long i don't know what you want to call it like a faded animation where it looks like it has a shadow that's going to be like the really deadly combo of rapier strikes so if you're able to notice that like very early on where he's still just sort of flourishing like right now then you want to try to roll away i did notice that if you get hit by the first strike it'll usually just stop but truth be told that could be two different moves that only happen like once or twice in the entirety of my attempts on these guys and i was trying for like an hour so you see here you can roll through that final strike and be okay i'm gonna roll in because of the double helm smasher do it again one hit two hits dead and then the fight's still not over but don't worry it kind of is as long as you have enough health to survive a possible leap by a snail but the snail will come out of the corner right here and there's a lot of messages in this corner so i am curious if it's killable but i do remember realizing oh this is a spirit snail cave so this is a spirit snail boss again i do remember swinging my sword all around this corner and nothing happening so i do think you're supposed to fight these two but that's it that is the whole fight it is very difficult and you will require a lot of attempts good luck but that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden

Title: Roundtable Knight Vyke (Lord Contender's Evergaol) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring
Video ID: Q6P8Z2khSzE
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat round table knight vike this guy may seem familiar to you it's because you fought sort of like a later form of him in terms of story back in learning of the lakes near the frenzy flame village but this version is way more intense so he has some red lightning dragon abilities and those deal a ton of damage the most devastating attack this guy has is that jump you saw just before it's both devastating because if he gets the full hit on you where if you get stunned and then stabbed it's a one shot basically from 100 to zero you're dead the other frustrating thing is that the whirlwind effect on it lasts a considerable amount of time to the point where i think they shun kinda should nerf it in my opinion that said though if you time it correctly you can get in on him and get a backstab it is a little difficult though vike is a npc so he can flask up just like an invader however he only has one flask so even though it heals basically his entire health bar it's okay you only have to deal with that once just consider it more health on the health bar don't get too discouraged by it the other very clear major ability that he has is a lightning attack that is unique to him and when you kill him you will get it as loot so i'm only using a straight sword however it is the coated sword which scales only with faith it only deals holy damage he seems to be weak to holy because this sword did more damage than my plus 23 long sword so if you have any faith-based weapons go ahead and give those a try i'm not exactly sure why he's weak to faith it could be a story reason because of the frenzy flame not 100 sure but the main thing i'm trying to point out is that he does not have much poise at all one hit from a long sword will get him to be interrupted from most attacks this does not count for the big leaping attack do not attempt to hit him out of that because it's not gonna work luckily the whirlwind of that startup did not hit me only the stab did so that helped a good deal the tricky thing is that you can backstab him after that leap attack however because the whirlwind lasts on the hit for a while it's tough to get in on him and what could end up happening is you get stuck in the backstab animation but the backstab doesn't happen and then he gets follow-up damage on you and possibly a kill so well i won't say don't fish for backstabs against this guy because you do want to kill him before he just whittles your health down and runs you out of flasks which is entirely possible considering everything he does does damage even when you're blocking you don't want to get caught up trying to fish for backstabs too often because he is able to sort of avoid them in a way so only do it once you get comfortable with the timing of that whirlwind the only other spell that he has is this triple lightning strike he can sort of spam that so you have to pay close attention to his hand he can do it two or three times and the third one is kinda rare but it's really there to like throw you off so if just run in one direction and just pay attention to him there's no shame in just letting him not necessarily dictate the speed of the fight but there's no shame at just letting him do what he wants while you run away to kind of get a good look at the animations see what you should be looking out for and then healing up when necessary i did notice that his regular spear thrust he has a tendency to do multiple thrusts in a row even if you're not near him so if you notice that happening and you're at sort of like a mid distance from him you can bait out his extended spear thrusts just like that right there even though he wasn't near me he still kind of does it a couple times so if you notice him going for that long third thrust start to move in let it happen and then punish right after or if you're using a quicker weapon like a long sword or a dagger then you can just hit him out of it like i said he has no poise the other thing that you want to try to do is always run to your right his left because he only attacks with one hand he really doesn't to hand his weapon ever so unless he's using the big spear charge ability you don't have much to worry about you notice there i was i don't know in my opinion within backstab range but i wound up only getting a hit so what i recommend doing is just paying very close attention to what you are doing i know that sounds kind of obvious but if you press r1 and you assume that you got a backstab you're probably going to get in trouble for it so make sure you got that backstab before sort of letting go of your controller breathing and repositioning yourself or resetting yourself i should say he is especially vulnerable when he is putting on the lightning buff there is no lightning strike associated with it that can deal damage to you so just feel free to go in and get some damage on him when you defeat him you get vike's dragon bolt as well as a fingerprint armor and if you put on the fingerprint armor you will notice it looks suspiciously like an armor set from demon souls so not sure what that means i have a odd feeling and i have not beaten the game this is just a theory i have an odd feeling elden ring is connected to all of souls i don't know i don't know why i think that there's just so many callbacks that have deep lore implications i think but i could be crazy but that's it that is round table night vike in the lord contenders ever jail

Title: Fire Giant (Flame Peak) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: fp3VRFWUjtk
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the fire giant in flame peak in the mountain tops of the giants phase one for this fight for me is a lot easier than phase two it's much more controllable and much more predictable starting off the fight you want to start riding on torrent towards the boss you basically want to be on torrent the entire time for this fight that's just my experience sometimes the boss will start off sending out a big shock wave of snow towards you it is avoidable if you can jump at the correct time fortunately he didn't do it on this particular attempt so um you know i didn't have to deal with it but i wasn't always able to jump over it i could never really get the timing down myself but because it happens from so far away even if you do get hit by it starting off the fight you should be okay to just keep going and heal up and maybe revive torn if you need starting off in the fight we are attempting to break off the splint around the boss's leg if you do that just by whacking at it a few times the bone splint will come off and then it exposes the weak point for phase one all you have to do is stay underneath the boss most of the time keep hacking away at the exposed flesh of that foot or that leg really and then you will be doing a significant amount more damage to the boss while you are underneath the boss it can create these flame vents they don't last very long and they don't actually have that big of an aoe so if you feel like you have a decent amount of space to stand between a few and still attack the boss go for it it's actually pretty viable occasionally the boss will send out flame orbs sort of like a dawn thief of fire i believe his name was back in leonia for those you just kind of want to get close to them and then they will sort of set off the proximity mine inside of them and then explode a little while later so you just kind of want to run through them on torrent for the most part you can stagger the boss however there is no riposte opportunity in phase one so you're better off just staying on its left leg and just keep chopping down the tree hacking away at the exposed flesh and then just doing a ton of damage that's really kind of the strategy here if you notice that the boss while standing his foot keeps tracking you in phase one like he's literally spinning around with you that means he's going to drop the plate so you just want to watch out for that here in phase two you can immediately get a stun on the boss and expose its eyeball however the eyeball repast for me at least did not do much damage so while the the stun is really really effective and keeps them down for a significant amount of time going in and repasting that eyeball really didn't make a difference it did so little damage that i just decided to stay in the boss's face and just attack him normally it worked out better for me the other thing that you want to watch out for after you do repast the eye if you choose to is that the boss can very quickly stand up and slam you to the ground likely one-shotting you so if you do go in for the riposte you want to immediately mount up on torrent after it's finished and ride away to get away from the boss throughout phase two you just want to stay near the boss's left leg the one that you chopped off the splint for in phase two that leg is missing and so whenever the boss rolls the foot or the missing foot will just go over you so it's a pretty reliable strategy to just get under him stay near that chopped off limb attack for a little while and then the boss will roll over you the roll will completely miss you and then you just go back in and do the same thing the boss has a couple of fire attacks during this phase he keeps the orb attack from phase one he also keeps the fireball attacked in phase one that he luckily never did and the boss can also breathe fire out of the mouth on its chest and to be very careful for that if you notice that the boss is starting to attempt to stand up while you're underneath him chances are he's going to just fall right on top of you that attack is a little unpredictable especially because if you're relying on chopping the removed limb area as a strategy it's kind of hard to get out from underneath the boss while he is doing that if you notice that the boss rolls in the opposite direction from where he normally rolls so if he's not rolling uh to his left instead he rolls to his right there's a pretty good chance that he's gonna roll again immediately and when that happens he can roll on top of you and sometimes kill you if you notice that fire is coming out of the boss's chest mouth that's a weird phrase if you notice this coming out of his chest mouth it's sort of like a dragon breath it's going to track you but the tracking is incredibly incredibly tight so you don't want to stop running and you do not want to change your angle of attack really like you just want to keep running in the same direction you start at this way you do not lose any speed when the boss reads two fireballs just pick a direction and run in it and don't stop running until they're gone if you're underneath the boss he really won't do it but there's a chance that he can start a fireball as you're running towards him if that's the case just keep running through him and the fireballs will not reach you the tell for the fire orbs like trying to decipher what the difference is and how to tell whether or not that's coming out versus fireballs or just a normal fire attack the tell is a sound it's like a sharp charging sound if you hear that that's a fireball and you want to kind of run away and get your bearings this let's call it a volcano attack the eruption all you have to do to avoid all that and give yourself an opportunity to deal a lot of damage is stay behind the boss's foot and just keep attacking its feet as long as you're doing that the eruption cannot hit you if the sort of chunks don't really go behind him that often and when they do they won't be near his foot so you see here i just wanted to get rid of the orbs so i just rode through the boss i didn't bother slowing down to attack all i wanted to do is get them exploded this way i can sort of reset my positioning so you see here the boss when he rolls he does sometimes clip you which is why it's really important to stay at full health in order to knock a clip you want to try to stay in front of the boss's knee and then he'll just roll over you if you're kind of in front of the knee then there's a chance that he can smoosh you so you gotta be really careful this boss took me a long time to kill i know folks do this in one or two attempts but for some reason i just could not get this boss to play along if you are running away from the boss i recommend not healing while riding unless you know exactly what attack is coming out because the boss can chuck two fireballs at you unless you have a shield from a wondrous flask the odds of you surviving it are super low because if you're getting hit by one you're gonna get hit by the other the other thing too is if you get knocked off of torrent and you're not immediately underneath the boss and if you survive getting knocked off chances are he's gonna throw two fireballs and kill you anyway so it's really important that during phase two you stay as close to the boss as possible at all times unless he is breathing fire out of his chest mouth that's the only time you want to actively get away from the boss as well you know if you're trying to explode orbs or something to reset your positioning but you do not want to stay away from the boss for long in phase two otherwise it spells disaster that is it that is fire giant on flame peak if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden

Title: Astel, Stars of Darkness (Yelough Anix Tunnel) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: UsnEBeIVmUk
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat aztel stars of darkness in the yellow annex tunnel this boss drove me nuts for two hours and i'm happy to report that i know how to dodge every single one of its moves perfectly now i demonstrate it mostly perfectly but at one point or another in this video every move will be dodged perfectly starting off the boss will shoot a plasma beam at you it's sort of like a railgun you can just roll through it the tail for that is just look at the boss's head and when it starts to move down really quick that's when you want to roll you can also move to the side if you like right after that the boss will typically do a tail slam even though it's landing behind you it can still deal a lot of damage to you so you want to roll through it if you roll through the first one successfully just keep running and you won't even have to dodge the second one you just run up to the boss and do a bunch of damage you saw me move back into the boss after slowly backing up that's because it was readying its tail for a sort of like scorpion pincer move when that happens you just want to uh sort of get back in the boss's face and do that when the boss teleports you want to look around the room as best you can and you want to look up the reason for that is because the boss can teleport immediately above you swoop in and do a one-hit kill grab both of the grabs for this boss or actually all three of the graphs of this boss are basically one hit kills so you want to do your best to avoid those three moves at all cost when the boss's blue eye begins to glow and you are in front of it you want to wait until the eye is just about staring you dead in the eye and then you want to roll that's when the grab is coming just wait for the eye to be mostly still it'll still kind of be jittering but once it's looking directly at you that's your opportunity to roll avoid the grab get some damage in whenever the boss does two pincer moves it will almost always follow up with a bigger pincer you want to roll through that bigger pincer and here's the teleport grab that one's freaky you want to roll through that third pincer because there is a chance that it can actually clip you from behind and turn you around so even though there's a lot of opportunity for you to be able to just sort of stand in the boss's face not get hit by hit by that third pincer you still want to dodge it just to give yourself the best positioning when you notice the ball starts to snake up and its hands start to glow you want to get as far away as possible because it's going to do some pretty big shock waves on the ground you want to be nowhere near it for that when the boss teleports again look up look around if it's above you just wait and then roll through the grab but when the boss teleports and it's near 50 health or below you want to back up because if the blue eye in the middle of its head starts to glow it's going to summon a meteor shower and you want to be as far away from the boss as possible when that meteor shower hits reason being is you want to be able to target the boss from a great distance and then get a very clear view of the entire meteor shower and then just roll for the three meteors that can hit you most of them are going in nonsense directions that you don't even have to worry about however they can sort of come from the side sometimes so the further away you are from the boss the bigger your field of view think of it like a shooter you need a bigger field of vision to get more information so that's why you want to back all the way up for that meteor shower you'll notice that when the boss here comes another meter share we'll actually cover it again so you see i'm very far away from the boss i'm able to very clearly see when the meteors are coming for me i just blocked one and i was fine so you'll notice that when i'm very close to the boss and it starts to jump and leap over me and put some stardust in front of it you'll notice that i'm untargeting the boss and getting back in front of it the reason i very specifically do that and i very specifically get back in front of the boss is because it can do a gravity attack while you were underneath it that you need to run out of and if this is the move here when that happens you want to run back towards where the boss is going to land and if you can untarget him and then you'll be in a better position for that eventual gravity attack this move here is the craziest move of the fight and his other version did not have it so it took me a while to learn but basically if the boss is not showing up at all if he teleports and he's not above you and you do not see the star teleport coming from any other direction that means that clones of the boss are going to swoop down and try to grab you the way to avoid that attack successfully is to run to the center of the room the reason being is that they will coalesce in the middle but they can't grab you there so if you don't see the boss coming back from a teleport run to the middle of the room cannot stress that enough if you get tagged by that you're dead and those are the insane abilities of this fight all the grabs are one hit ko's like i said here you see me untarget the boss get back in front of it when you see his tail jitter you want to get back in front of the boss this is the big gravity attack i do a roll once the boss starts to move up once his head starts to move just straight up towards the sky i don't know if that actually helps i feel like that move cannot be rolled through but the roll may just be giving me extra distance so just roll run away and then roll once the boss starts moving up towards the sky and you should get out of it and that is basically the fight when it starts to put stardust in front of you if you're close enough to the boss you want to actually get back in front of the boss you could roll through that stardust before it explodes you'll be able to do more damage and then you'll be in a good position for later so the boss teleports here the blue eye starts to glow that means the meteor shower is coming we can dodge successfully we dodged two of them blocked the first one no big deal you can dodge all three it is a little challenging though um and honestly god you're sometimes better off just getting far away holding up a shield blocking the first one and then rolling twice uh you'll always roll through the second one and the third one but you just be careful because sometimes they can come from the side and you're not even able to see it that's why it's very very important to get as far away from the boss during the meteor shower as possible okay so the boss is snaking up here while i'm close and then it puts gravity orbs on all of its limbs you get as far away as possible from the boss when it does that it's doing a tail slam here just like in the beginning so we're able to just get underneath the boss deal a decent amount of damage i'm trying not to be greedy here i want to make sure i know what's coming this way i don't get stuck in a gravity well attack and i'm searching for a limp to hit for the final hit for your efforts you'll get the meteorite of aztel and then you can leave this place this is the yellow annex tunnel in the consecrated snowfield area of the mountaintops this does require the heylig tree medallion in order to reach the first part of it is in the village of the albanorics there is a pot early on in the village that is against uh the cliff wall just up the hill from where the uh the side of grace is in the village of the albanorics you want to roll into that pot it'll reveal an npc speak with him he'll give you one half the medallion the other half of the medallion is in castle seoul which is in the mountain tops of the giants and you got to beat the final boss there in order to get it but that's it that is as tell stars of darkness very difficult boss but a lot of fun all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're

hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the stray mimic tier in the hidden path to the haleg tree this is a doppelganger boss fight so it's going to be different for you as it is for me unless you're using my exact setup of the briar armor set and this great sword here what you can do for this fight however and folks have confirmed this in my comments from the other mimic tier boss fight is you can enter the room unarmed let the boss spawn and then take out your weapon and the boss will only be able to punch you with its bare fists so it's very easily exploited if you're having any sort of difficulty fighting it you can go that method and just destroy the boss in a few hits and will basically do no damage to you the boss can flask once it does not share your same amount of flasks which is pretty nice considering i came in here with about 13 of them so you only have to deal with the flask once it's sort of like a pvp invader um the boss will try to heal and then it will shake the bottle upside down realizing that it's empty and then you can get some free damage while that's happening but keep in mind that the damage output that you have is the same damage output that the boss has so if you're using a really devastating weapon that does big chunks of damage on each hit you're gonna take a lot of damage from them but after a little while you'll be able to get it down and again you can sort of abuse that unarmed strategy you get the black flame monk amen spirit ash and then inside of that chest is a death root so be sure to loot that and then bring that to grank back in the b steel sanctum and that's pretty much it if you're wondering how to even get here it is a bit complicated you need two halves of the heilig tree secret medallion the first half can be found in the village of albanorics back in lyrinia of the lakes there is a pot along the cliff wall in the beginning of the little town there and it is a mimic so just hit it once or roll into it speak to the npc until he gives you one half of the medallion and then the other half of the medallion is in the mountaintops of giants in an area called castle soul the boss of that dungeon is guarding it so once you defeat the boss move out of the boss room go up an elevator and you can loot it off of the floor there and then you could use that medallion on the grand lift of rolled that brought you into the mountaintops of the giants and then once you're down there using the secret medallion you'll be brought into the secret or hidden path to the halek tree and then there is an invisible floor that you can jump down onto and then that leads to this dungeon a little complicated a little long-winded but it is a very hidden area with a very hidden dungeon but that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always also johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Great Wyrm Theodorix (Consecrated Snowfield) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: os_fL7XOKK4
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down great worm theodorics in the consecrated snow fields this boss can be located in the ravine that just goes all the way through the area and then once you are here we're gonna employ what i am deeming the discovery channel strategy i'm going to aggro every crab i can find every land octopus i can find and then i'm going to rush the boss just hit it once and try to cast poison mist and then let the local animals do the job for me it's not going to go all the way although i have gotten this boss insanely low on health just by using the land octope so it is completely possible that they will finish the job for you and that works i find lava worms to be your magma worms to be a little frustrating to fight they're so big and they move so fast that the camera is constantly another enemy in the room so i do whatever i can to kill them as quickly as possible even if that means using other enemies as meat shields because it just works so you can run away from this boss for as long as you like as long as you don't rest at a site of grace the boss's health will not reset it can go pretty far up the ravine before it despawns and goes back to its original location however when that happens you can just go get it again and the health bar will stay what it was when it despawned so elden ring is pretty good about that especially with these field bosses which is quite nice so unfortunately the discovery channel strategy isn't working out for me as strong as a different attempt but it's fine these animals will deal a decent amount of damage to the boss so while this is happening i'm literally just going up to the boss whacking it and trying to kite it into the enemies unfortunately the crabs are a bit shy but the land octopi are very gung-ho about battles so they will go in no matter how little provocation they have if a magma worm looks at them the wrong way they're gonna go for it so while the animals are battling the boss for you sort of like pokemon you do need to still dodge the tax most notable is the sword attack that can cover a huge uh area and so you need to be ready to double jump very quickly over that while it's in phase one during phase two things get a little different and a little bit more hairy um so unfortunately the the animals will not survive that long because they just sort of get stuck in lava a lot of times but as you can see here the land occupied can just jump and do a ton of damage really fast and that will also deal a decent amount of stagger damage to the boss itself so when that happens you want to be ready to run in and stab it in the eye for a big riposte and some extra damage so again unfortunately i really couldn't get the crab to do much even though the boss is right on it it just kept running away and it really wasn't helping me at all but believe me when i tell you these things can help a good deal if they play along nicely unfortunately that wasn't happening for me so i sort of began to recognize that and i figured you know what let me just go in fight it myself the fight i don't know if i really recommend being on torrent i fully expected to die during this attempt because i had been on this for about an hour but with torrent you just want to be careful if there's any crabs chasing you one hit from a crab can basically knock you off and if not completely kill the horse thus costing you a flask so you have to revive it so the boss despawns here no big deal we're just gonna go chase it down again and then we're just going to fight it one-on-one because clearly this crab does not want to get involved and it really just wants to help the magma worm and not me which is very rude if you ask me so we're going to try to fight it a little ways out of this circular area for the simple fact that when the boss runs while spewing lava it can sort of get stuck on a round wall and then it will automatically start curving thus putting a lot of lava down across a wide area so you want to try to get him out of his little spawn circle area into the ravine proper this gives you a lot more room to work with and if there's any enemies left in the area they can help you out so when he is in phase two he can get up on his hind legs and do a whole lot more than if he was just crawling around you have to stay behind the boss during this phase if you don't there's a high high likelihood of you getting slammed by his sword speaking of his sword the boss can get back on all fours and sort of slink around the arena while it's doing that it is going to swing its sword with violent speed and when it does that you just want to double jump over it or if you're on foot just roll really late but very quickly so once the boss sort of starts facing you again while it's doing this big wind wind-up it's a very obvious move it can only do one thing out of it and that is swing the sword but when that is happening you just want to roll to your left and then you'll go right through the sword all right so we got a riposte on the boss frankly it doesn't deal a ton of damage so you may just want to stay on the boss's tail and chop it up until the boss gets up that is another perfectly viable option especially if you're using a weapon that has bleed like a katana or if you just have bleed grease on your weapon itself then just stay on the boss don't go for the riposte that's my recommendation so like i said before in phase two the front of the boss is its deadliest area because it can do all sorts of sword slams when it is holding its sword up for an extended period of time you need to be very careful because the boss can track you really well and so even though it may be facing one direction here's that big sword slash i was talking about just double jump over it but because the boss appears to only be facing one direction it may look like the boss can't track you and that he's just gonna slam it where he's facing that is not true even though the boss will not move for a while it will move once it's ready to strike and it can turn around not a full 180 degrees but pretty darn close so this is basically the fight we're gonna get him here in a minute just a couple more hits and he goes down just pay close attention to your stamina meter if you're on torrent because you do not want to run out of stamina and not be able to escape very quickly always leave one or two notches of your stamina bar this way you can speed out as quickly as possible so here's a location for the boss right near the cave of the fort lauren in the consecrated snow field if you haven't yet made it here it is a bit complicated you need to put together the haley tree secret medallion the first part of which is in the village of the albinorics back in leonia of the lakes the second part is in castle seoul in the mountaintops of the giants so if you have not made it here get both of those pieces and then go back to the grand lift of rolled in the forbidden lands and you'll have a new option to hold up the secret medallion and then you can get into this area all right that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you

Title: Misbegotten Crusader (Cave of the Forlorn) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: U0BmuTHQnEo
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the misbegotten crusader in the cave of the forlorn in the consecrated snow fields this boss is incredibly difficult i cannot overstate that he gave me a really hard time when his counterpart in castlemore in the beginning of the game i one shot going in with no flasks this guy can basically one shot you or at least one combo you with pretty much any variety of his moves when he does this golden order blessing he will then spin around twice and fire a let's call it a rune arc the second time so what you want to do is back up from when he's doing the blessing because the explosion is an aoe and will deal damage and likely put you on your butt and then you want to roll through the second attack to get into the boss to deal one or two hits the name of the game here is one or two hits you do not want to go for much more than that unless it's after one specific move where the boss drives the sword directly into the ground so you see there he whips the sword around twice and on the second one i roll to either avoid the runer can get back and heal or to go in and deal a little bit of damage but again the name of the game is one or two hits you want a shield with a 100 physical block rating unfortunately i have not found a shield with a decent amount of holy block not much more than 50 on the brass shield so i'm just using my regular shield here which is a kite shield so here he's going to do the run arc again i'm just going to roll to the side use that opportunity to heal whenever he leaps he will do one attack and then most of the time he will do a roar you need to block that roar because it's going to deal damage as well as drain your stamina so you don't want to be totally exposed there that attack there where he drives the sword directly into the ground that is your biggest opportunity for damage you can maybe get three hits on him if you're quick and you recognize that it's happening i really recommend holding up your shield for that rune arc even if you're going to roll because if you miss time the roll you're at least going to block it and be able to uh you know at least not take a ton of damage so just hold up your shield and then roll that's my suggestion for that the boss has a lot of long combos and they all take a ton of stamina so you need to keep a close eye not only on your health but on your stamina as well because if you are low on stamina and you're gonna see it here as this fight drags on it's gonna happen to me if you're low on stamina you're gonna get your shield broken and then possibly killed that happened to me more times than i could count see i got a shield block here then he roars luckily uh what you can do is if you are feeling comfortable enough with the boss's attacks where you kind of know what's going to come next after one or two tries or after one or two uh swings if you know what's going to come next drop your shield and start backing away you recover stamina faster in elven ring when your shield is not raised so while your shield is raised your stamina recovers a lot slower than if you just were walking normally so don't be afraid to just back up from the boss and as long as you're far enough away to where he can't do a claw swipe or clip you with a long swing of the sword you just want to back up do not hold your shield up and let your stamina replenish that way so this leaping attack here i noticed that he will always swing and then do two claw swipes it is always going to be two claw swipes i can't tell you how many times i tried to roll through the first one only to get hit by the second one and want to smack myself in the face for doing it i just like could not learn the lesson that it is two claw swipes and not one and you can't just roll through one and then expect to roll together it's too fast maybe if you had light roll i have a medium roll on this build that's just me so basically the only attack that you have a lot of time to deal damage to is when he drives a sword to the ground i know i mentioned that a couple times but this one here he's going to roar and then if you're close enough he'll do a couple of uh claw swipes whenever he does the double swing you want to either roll very late or roll to the left this way you roll with the sword not against it and then that will buy you enough time to roll a second time and avoid the attack when the boss sort of dashes into you with a sword swing it can do that for a while it can keep repeating that one attack probably two or three times while that's happening i do not recommend going after the boss just let him do his thing because eventually he'll get into a better pattern for you this whole fight is about patience you don't want to try to rush the boss down you're going to get punished for it really hard and you want to do your best to always have enough stamina to roll at least once because if you can roll once that means you can roll twice you're going to have enough recovery time to roll again so always leave enough stamina to roll at least once don't ever drain your stamina bar purposely against this boss but that's it for your efforts you get his weapon the golden order greatsword it does have a pretty hefty stat requirement with strength decks and faith so unless you're doing a primary dex build with faith i kind of wouldn't recommend this sword i'm going to level it up if i have enough materials personally but the scaling with strength is e whereas with dex it's d so i assume that by the time this gets to plus 10 uh strength is a b dex and faith are at a or s but that's just the theory i haven't leveled it up just yet but that's it that is the whole fight you can find this in the cave of the forlorn in the consecrated snow fields if you have not yet reached the consecrated snow fields it is a secret area that requires two halves of the haley tree secret medallion the first half can be found in the village of the albanorics back in leonia of the lakes there is a pot against the cliff wall right in the beginning of the village just past the site of grace if you hit it or roll into it you will find albus who is disguised as the pot speak with him enough and he'll give you one half of the haley tree medallion the second half can be found in castle seoul up in the mountain tops of the giants you need to defeat the boss there commander nile and then reach the roof which is free after you beat it and there's no more enemies and then the second half is on the roof and then you want to go back to the grand lift of rolled and you'll have a new option to hoist the secret medallion and then reach the consecrated snow fields that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get

Title: Putrid Grave Warden Duelist (Consecrated Snowfield Catacombs) - Full Narrated Guide - Elden Ring
Video ID: mHEPjzXjrcU
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down the putrid grave warden duelist in the consecrated snowfield catacombs in the consecrated snow field okay so this boss is just your typical duelist boss however he does have a breath attack that can spread scarlet rot and basically all of his physical attacks will build it as well these guys are actually some of my favorite bosses i find the sound of their weapons hitting the terrain to be incredible all right so i've been trying to learn how to parry these guys i was really good at it in the beginning of the game but now i'm terrible especially because i'm so afraid of the damage that they can do let alone the scarlet rot so i'm going to more or less stop trying to parry them and we'll just get on with it if the boss grabs you it will take out a snake that will instantaneously give you scarlet rot so if you have any preserving ballises you want to go ahead and put those on your bar the recipe book for those preserving boluses is located in shifura river just behind the scheifer riverbank side of grace it's located on a corpse so very early on in the game you can learn how to make those once you're done messing around with your bar and getting your flasks back up there it's time to actually fight the boss so it can be parried it can also be backstabbed which is really easy to fish out i'll start doing it by the end of the fight just to kind of close it out but you can fish out backstabs on this boss like no other it's really not that hard the boss has some pretty long combos and they all sort of extend into each other so it's sort of like the combos aren't really ever over he can keep following up granted they're not very fast he is using a great axe which is slow by nature the upswing attack there can drain a lot of stamina and then because the weapon is also infused with scarlet rot it's gonna break through your 100 physical block rating shield no matter what so you really just got to keep an eye on your health i know that sounds obvious but if you're used to just blocking physical attacks with a 100 block rating shield it can be easy to forget that you're still taking damage here so always keep an eye on it the boss can shout and buff himself when this happens he just deals a lot more damage he can still be staggered if you are using a greatsword or a great axe or something i personally use that but when i started the fight i hit him twice with my greatsword and completely stunned him so it was didn't feel like i'd make a pretty good guide if i went in here with anything but a regular long sword so one interesting thing and you'll see me do this here in a minute is that if you are a miracle user and you use this the incantation heal you will be the perfect height for his attacks to just go over your head i don't understand why this happens in every one of these games i always find a way to just completely ignore a boss and it seems like heal is the way to do it of course the upswing could break that pretty easily but for some reason he just never did it so you'll see me start using heal here in a bit because i was running pretty low on flasks but yeah so if you're an incantation user keep that in mind you can heal kind of safely against this boss all right so this attack here is probably the trickiest he runs into you and while that's happening he has his axe ready so what you need to do is just pay very close attention to his hands and once his hands start swinging towards you that's when you want to dodge the rest of that attack is basically just a freak out so you know don't worry about it too much but once his hands start moving that's when you want to go okay so you saw there i fished out a backstab with his big overhead slam that's really the attack to do it if you're quick enough you can also get it on this chain attack you do need to successfully roll through it otherwise the chain will push you away but that's it that's the fight it's a grave warden duelist which you should have fought a few times by this point but with the added benefit of scarlet rot and a bite that just completely exposes you okay so you can find this boss in the consecrated snowfield catacombs in the consecrated snow field the consecrated snow field is a hidden area that requires both halves of the halig tree secret medallion the first half can be found in the village of the albanorex once there there is a pot against the cliff wall this is just up the hill from the side of grace you want to either roll into it or attack it once to expose albus who is an albignoric and he will give you one half of the medallion when you exhaust his dialogue the other half of the medallion can be found in the mountaintops of the giants in castle soul when you defeat the boss there just go up to the roof and you can find it there and that's it you need both halves and then you can go back to the ground left of rolled and you'll get a new option to hoist the secret medallion and the lift will take you somewhere else and that's it all right if you have any questions please

hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the putrid avatar in the consecrated snow field this avatar can spread scarlet rot however unlike the one in caitlyn you actually have a lot of room to work with so it's somewhat easy to manage when the boss does its ground pound you want to run far away from it because the scarlet rot splash travels at great distance that's really the crux of the fight is when the boss has a ground pound get away and then when the boss of the ground pound again run in the opposite direction you are on a bit of a cliff here there are ramps that lead back down to the main snow field but you are high up here so you don't want to accidentally fall off and die to fall damage when the boss is you know one hit from death so all we're going to do is just rinse and repeat this strategy when the boss sticks its hammer in the ground it will do the starfall attack that is somewhat difficult to dodge in this arena that's kind of the gimmick here is that it's easy to manage the scarlet rot but difficult to manage the stars what i recommend doing is as soon as you recognize that that's what the boss is doing you want to run in one direction and do your best to find terrain to hide behind the boss can follow you pretty aggressively while the starfall is happening so that's why it's important to get away as soon as possible i'm going to do something pretty rare here only because it's it's an urgery avatar and we fought 15 of these things by now so you should sort of know the drill but i used theodorix's magma just to see what would happen and it does a decent amount of damage to the boss so if you have any sort of lava spells that the boss can get stuck in go ahead and use them they're pretty effective i tried hiding behind that tree stump for the starfall not very effective because the stars can go around it because the the cone of them is so wide there's so many so i really don't recommend uh you know trying to go for that too hard you want to hide behind rocks or the bigger tree roots that's really your ticket so again i'm gonna try it fail and then luckily uh one star stunned me and a bunch went through me so i got very lucky there in my opinion that really should have been a death but for some reason the golden order was shining upon me during this attempt so that's really the whole fight there's not much else to it just run away from the putrid uh scarlet rot and then you know if you can't get away from it fast enough even though it looks like all of it is on the floor already there's always one stray splash that lingers and hits pretty late so you got to watch out for that unfortunately this boss does just take a while it is a lot of you running away unless you have a way to tank scarlet roth that i'm just not aware of of course if you have any preserving boluses go ahead and use those if you do get exposed but always make sure you are getting away from the boss because he can chase you pretty aggressively and that's it that is the whole fight all right so the consecrated snow field is a hidden area that you need to reach by getting both halves of the halogen tree secret medallion the first half can be found in the village of the albanorics back in lionea of the lakes here near the first sight of grace or actually the only side of grace here up the hill you'll find a pot against the cliff face this is a mimic however there is an npc inside not an enemy so just expose the npc speak with him and he'll give you the first half of the haley tree medallion the second half can be found in castle seoul up in the mountain tops of the giants you need to defeat the boss here commander nile and then the halek tree medallion half is waiting for you at the top of the castle just after the boss once you get both halves of the haley tree secret medallion you want to go back to the lift of rolled in the forbidden lands and then you will get a new dialogue option that says hoist secret medallion and that'll take you to a new location which leads to the consecrated snow field and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring this time I'm going to show you how to find and defeat MOG Lord of blood just a heads up there are a couple items that you want to bring into this boss fight so I'm going to show you how to get those and they will make the fight extremely manageable especially for the first phase and the phase transition completely negating the damage you would normally take between phases additionally I'm going to show you how to reach the boss and that will require the two halves of the halig tree secret Medallion I'll show you where each of them are and how to use it this guide however assumes that you have gone through Lanell Capital City because it's not reachable until you do that you can't find the second half of the haly tree Medallion you can even use the halic tree secret Medallion unless you've gone through Lanell so do not even bother watching this until you do that just come back later the two items that I'm referring to are the purifying Crystal tier which you receive at the end of Ura Hunter of bloody fingers's quest line you can mix that into your flask of wondrous physic and it purifies the Lord of blood's curse as long as you drink it so I'm going to show you how to get that and then I'm also going to show you how to get an item called mogs shackle which allows you to bind the boss to the ground making it so you can do incredible amounts of damage during phase one of the fight basically for free and if you use it efficiently then you'll be able to drop the boss well below 50% HP before he even gets to start transitioning into phase two so if you use MOG shackle efficiently and then use the flask of wondrous physic with the purifying Crystal tier you will take barely any damage at all during the phase transition you'll negate a lot of the damage that he would be recovering from a lot of the health that he would recover during that phase transition and you can enter phase two at a reasonable amount of Health remaining on the boss that said if you already have the purifying Crystal tier and MOG shackle great create the flask of wondrous physic with it bring the shackle into the fight and check the time stamps in the description below for the boss fight strategy for MOG Board of blood for everyone else let's begin with Euro Hunter of bloody fingers quest line the quest line for Ura involves him helping you with a bloody finger invasion of your own then you help him in a Invasion that he has actually initiated by the looks of it and then the third and final Invasion happens with the woman that he has been searching for and once you defeat her you will then receive the purifying Crystal tier the first Invasion occurs in the river that stems off of agill lake in Lim grave very early on in the game you can do this immediately after you start the game you don't even need to meet Ura in the first place however since we're covering a quest line here in this video I'm going to show you an easily forgotten and easily missed location that Ura actually starts off in the game again this is just outside of agill Lake underneath a big ruin and if you speak with him here before the first Invasion he will give you a little bit more dialogue you must be the new tarnished you do well to steer clear of a Gil Lake fledgling Dragon Roost there and it's as fearsome as it is majestic so unless you're mad or wish to be burned alive stay clear of the lake [Music] don't be a fool turn back before it's too late once you're ready you want to head through agill Lake avoiding flying dragon agil if you have not already defeated her then once you head up the river you will eventually automatically be dismounted and then the invasion will occur what you can do since you're probably very low level while this is happening you can just wait and uro will automatically Al gets summoned into your world have a little bit of dialogue and then he will help you kill bloody finger narus and then once naras dies you can head up the river a little bit further underneath yet another giant ruin and speak with Ura once more oh we meet again fought narus and lived you must have seen your Sheri of battle I your a as you might recall Hunter of bloody fingers tarnished held in th by cess blood zealots who stalk their own you stay the path you're certain to face more of them just remember no kinship with their elk remains their Madness prudes it don't me your emotions stay your blade be on your way perhaps we will meet again if fate permits as you progress through the game and make your way to leria of the Lakes you will eventually find a key that gives you access to the main Academy gate for the Academy of Ray lucaria Once here you want to walk through the Rune that is guarding the gate on the north side of the bridge and then eventually along this path you will see a red Invasion summon sign you want to summon yourself into ura's world and help him defeat the Raven Mount assassin that he is attempting to kill I find this very interesting because he is constantly going on about the bloody fingers and how they are part of a Cess blood and that hopefully the end is nigh for them yet you seem to be helping him in an invasion of somebody just going about their business maybe this is just the way they made it work for gameplay but storywise it felt a little strange to me once you defeat the Raven Mount assassin you want to go back into your world automatically and then find Ura on the north side of the bridge and speak with him once more and learn a little bit about elanora oh it's you thanks for your help there that bloody finger was a thorn in my side and now I'm finally rid of him here's a token of thanks please take it I may not have much time I'm dying to see you elanora Violet bloody finger yes I've been tracking elanora for quite some time she is the deadliest of all bloody fingers she's filed many an old hand already but in spite of her cess blood catry elanora is a proud night if she comes for you do not think twice you must flee there is no shame in self-preservation be on your way perhaps we will meet again if fate permits once you're finished adventuring in leria of the Lakes you want want to next head to Altus Plateau which houses Lanell capital city it's a beautiful region once here you want to find the second Church of America and inside of the crumbling Church you will find Ura dying on the ground nor it seems I am no mat for you but I've learned a thing or two myself you see I've sliced the finger off please please elanora yield to the CES no longer do not stain the immaculacy of your sord you fles you're fire once you defeat elanora you will then receive the item we've been searching for the purifying Crystal tier and now Urus quest line is over however something does happen with his body later on in the game but we will cover that in another guide I'll leave the mystery for now for mogs shackle we're going to begin at the Avenue balcony site of Grace in Lanell capital city I'm assuming that you have access to this already if you do not then I recommend just adventuring through the city you'll eventually come across it and then we can start from there again I know that some changes do occur late game to the city so maybe this point of Grace is not accessible I have no idea but you may need to make an adjustment if necessary okay from Avenue balcony we are going to take the following route we're going to ignore the Archer and there will actually be another Archer right here ow it's actually not an Archer it's a swordsman and he has lightning so you do have to roll to avoid getting struck by that okay and now in this area in this little decrepit town we are looking for a well to jump into so you want to follow this [Music] route wow there is still trying to snipe me that's that's impressive all right so follow this route and then the well in question is right here watch out for the aloric great so you can drop down open this door you do not need a key and then you can drop down here recommend turning on a lamp just to help yourself out come through this passageway and welcome to the Subterranean shunning grounds these rats will leave you alone for the most part so you just run past them or you can kill them they always have a chance of dropping a rune Arc I'm going to show you how to get to the site of Grace which is extremely important in this place because the enemies are very deadly so we're going to rest here and this is the underground roadside sight of Grace I'm going to assume that you can go through this area on your own I know I need to make a walk through I've gotten a requested a ton cuz this area is a little confusing but you only actually need to Adventure through this area and open up the first shortcut that's where we're going to start so we're going to go there now so from the side of Grace we're just going to run and then the first shortcut allows you to open this porus right here so we're going to run we're going to ignore these folks these fell twins here and we're going to come down here there is going to be a gargoyle oh boy waiting for you oh four hits okay then we're going to drop down a couple pipes so we're going to go here drop here and then you need to go all the way to the bottom and then drop here in order to survive all right you'll notice a really big crayfish in the distance there or maybe it's a prawn I guess it's a giant prawn okay and then there's this guy here as well he comes out he's trying to say hello but we can actually back in here just holding up my shield we can back in here and find another sight of Grace this is a completely separate dungeon it's like a mini dungeon called Lanell catacombs if you go through here and you need help it is a maze I will link a guide for it in the description below all right from here we can do this a lot safer there will be a corpse in the far Corner over here right in the back not even in the corner just against this back wall and that corpse will have mogs shackle the final requirement to find Mog is to obtain both halves of the halic tree secret Medallion the first part of this Medallion is available in learia of the lakes in the village of the Alban orics this Village can be located in the southwest portion of learia of the Lakes along the Cliff face keep in mind that you cannot reach the top of this cliff CT even though you can see it you cannot reach it until much later in the game so don't try to find a path from the village it doesn't exist you get to it another way eventually you will come across the village of albor site of Grace you can rest there and then head up the hill one more time there will be a perfumer playing a flute that sounds quite lovely you're able to sneak past it or you can fight it I recommend fighting it just so it doesn't bother you while you're speaking to this next PC but along the Cliff face you will find a suspicious looking Pop please no dear me I haven't a clue no secrets lie with me not a one oh please leave me be wait then you're not one of them well what a relief oh goodness me I am alus and aloric as you can see we're finished the whole village is finished the curse mongers have destroyed everything no one that remains has their wits about them I beg you would you look after this Medallion you must keep it out of the curs monger's hands and if you should meet the young albor latena then please give it to her a chosen land awaits us alinor The Medallion is the key that leads to the city it's only a quaint treasure for we who cannot make the journey but for dear latena it is needed to fulfill her purpose My legs will soon fade and with them my life alas this is the immovable fate of all aloric there is an additional bit of side questing that you can do with respect to this Medallion however it's unnecessary so I'm going to cut it out but if you'd like you can go speak with Giddy and the all knowing back in Round Table hold and he'll give you a hint as to where the next half may be or someone who knows where it would be and that is latena the person that Albus spoke of for now though since that's not necessary we can proceed to the mountain tops of the jum Giants if for whatever reason you do not have access to this area you first need to defeat the final boss of Lanell capital city and then you'll be able to exit out of a side street exit and get to a new area called The Forbidden lands proceed through the Forbidden lands it's very short at the end you'll fight a boss Black Blade Kindred and then you'll be able to use the grand lift of rol to go up to the mountains once here you want to proceed all the way through the main path until you reach the frozen lake then you want to go pass the frozen lake through a graveyard down a hill defeat a tibia Mariner and a death right Bird and then you will be at the entrance to Castle Soul Castle soul is a very difficult mini dungeon with a very difficult final boss there's only one boss here Commander Nile he's very tough if you need any help getting through this dungeon I have a full walkthrough available on my channel I've linked that in the description if you only need help for the boss you can either watch that and just skip to the end for the boss fight or you can watch my boss only guide which I have also linked in the description but once Commander Nile is defeated you can proceed to the roof of the castle and receive the other half of the halic tree secret medallion with both halves and toe you want to go back to the ground lift of rolled from The Forbidden Lands End and then you will have a new prompt allowing you to Hoist the secret Medallion and then this will bring you to the hidden passage to the haly tree this is a brand new area a big part of the mountains and this is where the next step to find Mog begins it's very short but you need to gain access to this area in order to even do it once you've made it out of the consecrated snowfield by following the lights you want to head to the Western section of the map and we are going to use a hidden portal that is tucked underneath a little Mountain Ridge you do not need to do anything special to use this it will be open and available to you as soon as you find it it is covered in blood which should give you a pretty big hint of where we're going so you spawn into a very dark cave and then you want to light a torch or put your Lantern on and you come out at mwin Palace if you look on your map while you're here you will notice that this is the final part of shifra river that had not yet been discovered so once you get here and once you get the map which I'll show you how to get in a bit you will now have the entire sheifer River area covered on your map and the name will finally appear on the banner once you reach the first s of Grace you can follow along the path that I'm showing you now this will bring you to the melum compound and that is the dungeon itself it's very short there's only one path through it there's a lot of really good treasure inside including some final smithing stones that that you need to get your weapons to uh plus 25 it's a really really lucrative dungeon so I highly recommend coming here even if you don't want to fight MOG right away just still come here loot everything and then you can level up your weapons you want to follow this path through this area very specifically because there are these red uh aloric enemies here that can summon big skeletons very similar to tibia Mariners and there are three of them in that area and the big skeletons coales on top of each other and deal massive amounts of damage on this corpse here will be the map so be sure to pick that up but this is the mwin dynasty Mausoleum compound and then you can rest at this sight of Grace head up the stairs and then after a little bit of adventuring and a few difficult enemies you will be able to finally fight MOG Lord of blood before you start the fight ensure that you have mixed your wondrous physic flask with the purifying Crystal tier that you got from Urus quest line and once you're ready proceed through the fog phase one is pretty hectic but with more practice you should be able to get through this somewhat unscathed you want to make sure that you have as many flasks as possible for phase two CU phase two gets nuts that first ability you saw there which is blood Flame claw the boss can do that in two ways he can either do it with a backhand or a forehand the backhand is quicker and when you roll through it the boss is going to do one of two attacks he's either going to do a trient charge which you need to roll for almost immediately again or with the forand attack he can do a swing and if you start attacking with a regular long sword before he starts That Swing you can actually get underneath him so you saw there that's the backhand blood Flame claw he follows it up with a trident charge almost every single time you just roll again for that when the boss goes to stab his Trident down you need to do a really good job studying that ability specifically because in phase two that can One-Shot you if you're not careful so again backhand blood Flame claw into a trident charge it happens almost every single time throughout phase one the boss will put blood curse marks on you through very obvious telegraphs when you get to a second one that's when you want to use MOG shackle the first time however you want to be very careful Do not drop the boss below 50% HP or get him even close to it with the first shackle reason being because you want to drop him below 50% HP and then during the transition drink your flask right away and then just start laying into him you want to do as much damage as possible to him as he's refilling his health this way you enter phase two with the boss at at less than 75% health and you're off to a much better start than you would be otherwise so during this phase the boss can do basically every ability he has will spread blood flame you have to be very very careful and some of his moves are extended so we'll go over those as well you want to pay very close attention to the boss's hand that is holding the Trident because when the hand moves that's when the attack is coming he has very long sweeping strikes and it's very important that you don't roll too early at the start of phase two you want to use a rune Arc and activate your great Rune to get more stats this is very very important when the boss stabs his Trident down into the ground even if you are not struck by it in phase one you can just roll behind him start dealing damage but in phase two it becomes somewhat of like a volcano geyser so you need to get away from the boss you can roll through that explosion but it's difficult and it's not worth it for this phase you just want to take it very very easy occasionally when the boss does his overhead slam of the Trident if you're near the sides and any grave markers are still around it can get stuck being a little bit of a lucky sort of thing and that allows you to get a lot more damage in phase two you really want to get good at rolling through the blood Flame claw the reason for that is because as Phase 2 goes on if you are far away from the boss he will spread a lot of blood flame on the ground that you will have to walk through blood flame ticks your health very very quickly and you do not want to have to deal with it so you want to stay close to the boss as often as possible when the boss flies up and throws the blood flame you want to roll through it and then walk towards the boss and roll through the boss as he f FES overhead you want to let him land on the other side of you because that will make it so he throws another Blood flame that you can roll through by the time you roll through that one the one that was thrown from the Trident while he was flying will have dissipated and you can proceed to attack the boss again every single piece of blood flame that the boss is putting down on the ground can be managed however if you feel like it's getting a little out of control you can just back up to the other half of the Arena where it's all clean for the most part the blood flame can go a long way but where it's clean for the most part and then that is when you want to start the pattern up again as you can see here the boss can do a scoop that spreads blood flame and then he will sort of land on his feet exposed for some attacks as you saw there he did the forehand blood Flame claw I started attacking after the roll the Trident went right over my head nothing to worry about you have to be very careful when the boss lands he has about a 50/50 shot of digging the Trident into the ground if that happens it's going to be a volcano geyser you need to get away you saw there I successfully roll through it I didn't want to rush in because my stamina is now getting very low and so I'm going to do my best to try to reset it I'm not going to go too far into the boss and I'm not going to overextend myself here when your stamina is running low this is a trick that you can bring out with you throughout the rest of this game in every Souls game in existence you regenerate stamina faster when your Shield is lowered so if your Shield is held up you're regenerating stamina very very slowly so if you have some space and the boss isn't doing anything lower your Shield let your stamina regenerate faster even if it means you're going to pick it up a second later that can be the difference between running out of stamina getting guard broken and getting killed versus just getting one more rolling and surviving and being able to reset that is MOG Lord of blood there is a lot going on in this fight cannot stress that enough so much in fact that I'm going to go through this again and explain more of his moves okay starting off again we're going to take this a little bit more slowly in phase one I practiced this so many times because it took me probably an hour and a half to kill him that I got through it very quickly but but his triend swings are very deliberate so he starts off with a backhand blood Flame claw into triend charge he puts the staff down forehand blood Flame claw start attacking because now I am lower because I'm attacking the Trident just goes over my head we're going to roll through that one and then you got to pay close attention to the tip of the Trident because it's going to slam into the ground you got to roll past the slam and then you can attack only in phase one though in phase two you got to get away from that okay so he's doing one swing two swing three swing sometimes the fourth swing can come and it is the Trident being plunged into the ground that is very difficult to see happen in the fourth swing but it is telegraphed the fourth swing if it's happening the Trident will be on the ground not in the air if the Trident is on the ground after the third swing of that combo this one right here if the Trident is on the ground he's going to plunge it it's a different attack it looks the same but it is different if you pay close attention okay so he's putting the marks on me now for those you can literally just get behind him by walking around him and attack him while it's happening then all you got to do is use MOG shackle bring him to the ground be careful not to drop him below 50% HP for the first one because you want as much damage as humanly possible for the third once the music has changed that means that Phase 2 is happening so you need to drink that flask as long as it has the proper mix that will negate basically all the damage here except for some small explosion damage nothing to worry about and you want to stay behind the boss during the transition the reason being is because he does a big sweep attack with a trident but if you're behind him it doesn't hit you so just stay behind the boss during the transition very very important so this two swing three swing combo the first two swings have different tails the first one is quick very easy to roll through the second one is delayed he starts with the Trident of above his head and then brings it level with him and then swings it we'll see it again in a little bit but it is different you just got to pay close attention to his hands whenever he takes a shower in blood flame you just want to get away from him you do not want to get one or two hits in cuz you're going to get ticking blood flame you're going to be close to him and he typically does follow-up attacks if you're close after the blood flame shower so you want to do your best to get away what I'm trying to do here is reset my myself as best as possible this way I can use a rune Arc I forgot to put it on my quick bar and I'm paying the price very dearly for it now when he throws blood flame in an arc you can roll through it when he throws it directly at you you need to roll to the side very important difference Arc roll through it straight on Roll to the side okay so these flying attacks are a little difficult to tell the differences of however when he's going to do a ground p pound a butt stomp he's going to flutter in the air one extra time otherwise he's just coming down with it and then it's a 50/50 of whether it's going to hit vertically or he's going to dig it into the ground just pay close attention you have plenty of time to react Arc blood flame roll through this is the flutter into a ground pound he slams it in that's what you got to watch out for forand blood Flame claw into a sweep however that is phase two so is a little bit different when he throws that Arc of blood flame from the sky you want to roll through it and then just watch the boss pass over you and then he's going to throw another Arc of blood flame all you got to do for that is roll through it and you'll be able to attack just fine okay so we roll through it boss passes over and then he's going to throw more blood Flame the first one dissipates we're good to go so he arcs it again I'm just trying to manage as best as I can here it is getting a little hectic in my opinion but we're doing what we can okay so he digs it in pull it out he had I dodged that that would have had a follow-up uh sweep strike again so just watch out for those but basically every single attack he does with a trident has blood flame coming off of it it's really difficult to manage all this so don't be afraid to just take it slow in phase two and do your best to slow the fight down by going somewhere else I know that's much easier said than done but it's really important that you do your best to control what you can and you can almost always control your own position so again with the flutter twice that means he's going to dig it in I'm realizing that now flutter twice is always a dig in easy enough to tell okay so yep flutter dig in we dodg that great job and then this is just an overhead cuz he does not flutter perfect so there's the tell for that we figured that out together here backhand blood Flame claw we just roll right through it no follow up from him he's going to take a shower so we're going to back up we're just trying to follow him wait for him to do something he starts off with a charge you can sometimes get clipped by that but you'll be okay as long as you sort of like understand that that's what just happened you're going to be fine all right a few more hits and he goes down he's going to throw another Blood flame Arc fly over us you see the blood flame is now dissipating he throws one straight on I accidentally roll forward get a little clipped by it not the end of the world big blood Flame claw last few hits MOG goes down that's the fight it is very difficult very very hectic but I believe in you this was a really frustrating fight for me to learn because you have so little opportunity to just tank hits and figure it out it is a lot of death and a lot of trials and tribulations luckily the stake of America is literally in front of the boss fog so you can retry within a matter of second seconds it's nice in that way but it can be frustrating I hope this guide has been helpful to you it is a very difficult very optional boss um he shows up again or whether or not you did it previously I did this is actually my second time fighting him he shows up again in the Subterranean shunning grounds where we found the shackle he is the boss of that dungeon not of Lane Del catacombs but of the Subterranean shutting grounds itself that fight is just the first phase for a full health bar but I have a theory that because he is part of the omen just like marget and at this point I'm not spoiling anything you had to have done this but marget may or may not be morot and because they are both Omens their shackles work on each other so margot's shackle which you buy from patches in the beginning of the game works on marget as well as morgot MOG shackle works on both MOG The Omen and MOG Lord of blood very interesting I'm not sure what the lore implications of these guys are but I'm extremely curious this is the first time for Elden ring that I've done a quest line inclusion for a boss reason I did that is because it takes a lot to get to this boss there's a lot of secret stuff you got to do very long Quest chains and in my opinion I try to sort of like summarize quests as they're happening but as I kept putting the steps into this video I realized this Quest is super long I may as well just leave the dialogue in I am curious what you think of that if you'd rather just have a quick summary um you know like a 30 it's hard to even summarize this in 30 seconds but let me know if you like that style where I play out the dialogue I show you 90% of the steps I know I did skip the latena part but that is extremely optional um but yeah let me know what your thoughts are on this style of guide it is very long but I think it offers a full picture of this boss fight what goes into it how to find it and how to take them down but that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for Elden ring please subscribe to the channel

which hopefully will be within the next 24 to 48 hours i can make a full guide i'm just gonna play back the video and i'm gonna i'm gonna talk about it actually let me lower this i'm not yelling okay so straight up this is the important thing right here when she is strafing to her left your uh her yeah her left your right don't do anything just chill out because if you were to swing on her she will dodge and punish you don't do it because your weapon is going to go this way and she's going to go this way i am also using the golden order greatsword plus 10 it's a great sword not a colossal sword i have watched folks do this with a long sword so it is possible but i found that this i really like the move set on this it feels good and it's easy to react to okay so again when she's moving left don't do anything just just hang out all right so she's walking dead on she's gonna do one of two attacks here she's either going to jump which we're going to hit her out of no problem or you'll see a little later on she's gonna charge an attack when she's charging the attack you can hit her twice with a great sword and then you gotta worry about dodging so we're gonna hit her out of this okay we go two hits and then we always back up after our combo now you see here she's gonna run in and she's gonna do a slice and dice for that we roll up right and back however because the slice and dice had no sparks it is punishable i'm pretty sure that if you roll up right and then delay a forward roll you'll be able to punish her alright again she's strafing left we're not doing anything now she's straight on this is the charge attack you just hit her twice and then you can dodge it no problem a couple more attacks my general strategy is that when i hit her with a great sword and she gets staggered she sort of gets blown back i will follow up again i don't ever do more than two of those because i've had it happen on a third hit she may get staggered again but she can recover a lot faster i don't always follow that rule myself but i don't i try not to go more than two hits after a punish okay so you saw sparks there now you can all there's also a sound to it it's one of the few moves that has it has a very distinct sound so it was sparks so now we're gonna roll up right and back up right back i failed i failed that which is okay but that's dodging the slicing dice is the important part so upright and then immediately back i just messed up okay so again strafing left we're not doing anything we're literally just waiting for her straight on again we attack twice it's a 50 50 of what move she's going to do either the jump which we hit her out of or that charge move so you see there three times not doing anything up right and back up right and back on the slice and dice again straight on she just jumps no problem unfortunately there i'm not 100 clear on what exactly happened so we hit her out of it i didn't roll okay i just went in for a third that was my mistake i didn't i i didn't back out so upright and back same thing and now this is the move right here this insanity i'm gonna be honest with you like i don't really join the camp of oh this boss needs to be nervous boss needs to be nerfed i think this needs to be changed because this move is undodgeable if you are not far enough away and she can just do it in your face so unless there's some trick that everyone's missing which is always possible this can't be dodged what you want to do is you want to take out your shield i'm using the brass shield no upgrades take out your shield you want to block the first flurry and then you want to roll up and to the right twice or three times depending on how close you are to her i'm pretty far away here so it'll only be twice so you want to do up right and then back twice to dodge the final one okay so upright up right back back unfortunately i got hit once there but it's okay all right so straight on we hit her i was a little slow there i was too far away she can follow up with a big sweep into a slam that's an awesome opportunity to punish that right there is the stab you can just roll backwards and then immediately punish her so again slice and dice upright and back there was no sparks on it so she is open to punish but it's not exactly sure how to punish it but she definitely is because that's a long recovery time straight on hitter charge move dodge once dodge twice go back in once twice when three times that's okay we just dodged back from the rest okay so her strafing right you can do things but i noticed that it's a 50 50 whether or not you're gonna do something quick that you'll take damage from all right again so we're just backing up and then we take out our shield and then we're dodging back i kind of had to adjust my own dodging there just because i couldn't really tell where she was going but the the general strategy is the same up right twice in the back all right so we're going in for three now it's really important that throughout all this you keep a really close okay one you keep a really close eye on your stamina you want to make sure that you're managing it properly because if she goes up in the air to do the the blade flurry and you're half stamina you're probably gonna die so just make sure you're not over committing too much stamina she can't do the blade flurry like twice in quick succession or anything so after you've recovered feel free to play with her for a bit but then once it starts to your spidey sense is going off and like she hasn't done that in a while start managing your stamina a bit better so this move here this kick i don't like this move i really try not to ever punish it whenever it comes out i just try my best to dodge it you can roll into it but it is a late hit so just just keep that in mind it's sort of like the sakura ministry guys who have the crazy kick combos it's not a combo it's just one hit but you know just just dodge it and then back up and try to reposition yourself all right again you heard the sound i'm not sure if if you are able to hear it in this recording but she makes a sound there and then she comes in with the slice and dice so we're rolling upright and then yeah i try to figure out right there how do i punish this so i tried rolling into her but i was a bit late but i think that might be the move all right so this is just the stab you can punish her no problem that right there you'll notice that i hit her she didn't stagger that that kind of surprised me but because i have a great sword you can hold r1 and do like a late stab and that's a good way to recover it's it doesn't always work but if you feel like okay i'm in her face she's moving i've got to do something hold r1 for an extra second and then let it go and you may be able to hit her as she is resetting and her posture has gone back to normal so like you may get the stagger on a late hit alright so she's backing up i'm just gonna drink this flask recovers hp and gives me a shield to significantly reduce uh damage i forget the tier names but just look in your descriptions your tier descriptions okay that one's punishable i go in for three it's okay up right and back for the slice and dice again she's strafing i'm not doing anything i'm just moving along with her trying to keep her on flat ground okay twice for the charge she drops back down we hit her again twice go in for three it's okay up right and back all right she's strafing i'm strafing i'm just letting her do her thing it's frustrating to let her do her thing but that's what you gotta do so again we're hitting her twice she's going up she's coming back down hit her another couple times all right so see she could just do it in your face one an important thing here that i want to mention is that you noticed that i backed up at the start without having my shield up the reason i do that is because you move faster just backing up don't ever run because that puts your back to her and she's gonna kill you if you do that don't ever run away from her when she's doing this but you just want to back up not holding your shield and then as soon like the frame she starts moving hold l1 to hold up your shield look at that no damage she still heals off the block which kind of sucks but it's okay so she's coming in i really don't like those moves where you're far away and she just sort of does like a swooping strike i really don't dig that it's hard for me to even see coming and punish there's like no real tell she can be hit out of it though basically any move that doesn't have sparks she can be hit out of pretty easily all right so she's going to extend it a little bit which is frustrating like you just want the face to end so badly but you can't get it to happen all right so that is phase one i have not yet done phase two i mean i've i've failed like seven or eight times but this is the most in control phase one that i have ever felt myself so i wanted to make a guide real quick just to help everybody out again i'm hoping to have this done by tonight i feel like since i'm in control of phase one phase two should come together because it's mostly the same but it's hard to tell what she's doing for different reasons if you haven't seen it yet i'm not gonna show it but things are just a little bit different the camera angle changes a little bit so it's like hard to tell like when she jumps up through that big you know butterflies you know craziness um like the you know the i forget what i was calling it the big sweeping strikes sort of thing uh the hack and slash thing like the camera angle's a bit different so i can't always tell that she's doing it that's like my biggest hang up right now but that's phase one i hope this helps and i will see you soon with a full guide for melania blade of michela all right thanks so much bye-bye

Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring this time I'm very proud to present to you an in-depth breakdown of how to challenge and defeat melenia the severed blade of Micha goddess of rot in the haling tree this fight is incredibly difficult there are plenty of guides and walkthroughs out there that will show you how to take her down using bleed builds using a fully upgraded mimic tier summon summoning other players using Frost damage fire damage parrying all sorts of craziness and those are all very viable if you're good at parrying in this game go for it just be aware you have to Parry her three times in order to get a single repost so that as far as I'm concerned as a challenge run um and you can use bleed it does it gives you great Returns on this boss after you build the meter it'll deal like 3,000 damage to her it's pretty incredible but I realize that may not suit everyone's play style so what I wanted to do was give you like I said a very in-depth breakdown of all of her moves how to react to them and how to handle the fight we're going to start off we're going to give the breakdown of my character my build my weapons my armor talismans everything and then we're going to do a very in-depth analysis of her moves how to react to them and then at the end I'm going to just put in my attempt and my kill for you to enjoy so this isn't going to be my typical play the boss fight talk over it we're done this is going to go a lot further uh the attempt was streamed so thank you to everybody for joining uh I had a couple hundred people watching it was really really fun to do it as a group um and I got some great tips throughout uh especially for a Talisman that I think made the difference CU as soon as I got it about 30 minutes later I killed her so very helpful there um I want to give a really big shout out to a stream viewer crab this person gave me a lot of tips really really helpful thank you so much for the past 3 days you've been giving me tips for this boss and it just helped tremendously so thank you I will give you a fair warning in that uh attempt video that I'm putting at the end of this there's some strong language it is a very charged moment after 3 days of grinding and it may blow your speakers a little bit at the very end but should be fine I'll balance the audio don't worry but with without further Ado let's get started with the guide my character did this fight at level 1138 with 34 Vigor 20 mind 26 endurance 40 strength 21 dexterity 17 intelligence 42 faith and 17 Arcane I had a total of 1,392 hp5 FP and 147 stamina it had medium equipment load with four 43 Poise and then my discoveries at 117 and 10 memory slots I do use black flame a couple times in this fight just while she's coming out of her flower just to deal some damage not necessary in the slightest did not change my strategy because she only did that a couple of times if you have a spell handy go ahead and use it or use an item that casts the spell just get some extra damage in there while that's happening that was really my mission for my weapon and shield and Talisman and armor and flask I had a gargoyle's Greatsword plus 25 no infusion a brass Shield plus 22 this was a tip that I did not know until I started streaming this fight but you should upgrade your Shield as high as you can get it because the higher upgraded The Shield is the less stamina damage you take from an enemy's attacks so this is incredibly helpful for the blade flurry attack that you're going to have to be dealing with throughout the fight you want to be able to survive the first flurry and be able to roll twice immediately after this way you can get out of it and not take any damage very important to upgrade your Shield my armor was the Brier set and this is purchased from the finger reader and Round Table hold after you defeat Elmer of the Brier who is located in the Shaded Castle in Mount gmir this is the castle that surrounded by poison on the map you don't have to use this armor set it's really cool though it's an homage to Kirk Knight of thorns from Dark Souls 1 uh when you roll into things it deals a little bit of damage like 15 16 points of damage nothing crazy the cool thing is though is that you can trigger the phase transition by rolling into the boss if she's extremely low on health which is pretty neat I have actually gotten a repost on this boss from the armor believe it or not I have no joke rolled into her and she got a full stagger and I got a repost off of it it only happened one time in the hundreds of attempts that I put on this boss but it is possible you don't have to use it like I said nominal damage not a big deal use whatever armor you're comfortable with you do want something that can negate some damage though so I don't recommend using cloth or anything use some sort of good armor for my talismans I have the bull goats Talisman this increases Poise I have the rotten winged sword Insignia this gives you a buff a tiny buff after you successfully hit an enemy three times in a row you then get additional damage on future hits it only lasts a few seconds and you're never really going to be hitting the boss more than two or three times in a row however you may have opportunities where your third hit is dealing stagger to the boss still so you can go in for a fourth hit relatively safely and you'll get a little bit of damage or there are most cases where it's actually useful is that you hit hit the boss three times and then she will do a close- range attack that you can then punish the Bonus Goes in then so it is helpful you don't want to rely on it you don't want to just go in on the boss all aggression trying to get this thing to proc and use that bonus damage not worth it in that sense it's just a nice add-on which is really all you need next I have the dragon Crest Great Shield Talisman this greatly reduces physical damage taken the boss has a lot of one shot mechanics it's not going to negate anything from them at least in my experience maybe if I had really high Vitality it may be the case but if you ever get like sliced in some follow-up attack that you weren't expecting this can be the difference between life and death so really recommend this uh great Shield Talisman and then finally I have the her trees favor plus one which just boosts a bunch of stats for my flask of wondrous physic I have the opalene bubble te and the Crimson Crystal tier this gives me a shield that negates one hit for the most part it negates like 95% damage and then it will also fill half of my health bar so it's really useful to use um right in phase two if you're entering phase two without full health chug that as opposed to a regular flask this way you start off phase two with a shield that will negate one hit including a one shot hit um and maybe it won't negate the grab but it will negate everything else I think the grab counts as one damage to break the shield but it'll really help you out while you get your bearings that's the really important part all right so that is the build and now let's get into the boss and let's start breaking down her abilities starting with the first phase so I have the fight playing out in half speed here and this is going to last for the entire video Until I show the attempt in full with my stream commentary at the end General piece of advice I have to give for this fight is if at any point you see the boss strafing left or right do not attack her she is going to dodge your attack and very likely deal damage to you at best you trade but the trades are losses because she heals so just keep that in mind if she's walking dead on generally it's safe but it's not a guaranteed safe it's just very very likely that it's safe to do so I also light my Lantern just so I can better see what's going on okay so she's going to straight on I just go in and attack her no problem only attack twice because she's going to dodge after the second one and then do some sweeping strikes you can just roll away from those no problem this kick here is very tricky I really do not recommend punishing the kick unless you manage to land right next to her the stab strike I recommend rolling backwards this way you land right in front of her and then you want to be mashing R1 during your roll this way as soon as you come out of it you're able to punish so we the same thing here like mid roll line mashing R1 there but you don't want to overcommit because the boss has a low probability of actually recovering very quickly and stepping back she'll never attack right away so your r one will whiff and then you can roll back and reset yourself but that can happen Okay so whenever the boss sort of Glides to the side you want to move in the opposite direction to keep everything everything Square it's like a boxing match you never want to get yourself put into a corner so again for this we're going to roll back mashing R1 we get one hit I see the boss kind of get staggered a bit we go for a second hit the boss gets staggered again I go for a third this move here when you hear that very distinct sound the boss is disconnecting the sword from her wrist and holding it in her hand there are two variations of that move and I'm going to repeat it here just so you know what I'm talking about very clearly so you're going to hear a sound and then see the bosser to lift up her hand and she's going to disconnect the blade from her wrist and come into you with it what you need to do is roll up and the right to avoid it and then roll backwards to avoid the next slash however if when the boss does this ability there are no sparks with it the second attack of the string will be delayed and has an extremely long recovery time that you can very easily punish so if there's Sparks just back away let her do it don't punish if there are no sparks you can go in and punish that's the rule of thumb for that move and it continues through phase two as well so it's very important that you're able to recognize that attack and respond accordingly so there's a lot of waiting in Phase 2 for the simple fact that going in on her while she's strafing really isn't a good idea and if you get close to her you run the risk of dealing with a move that you can't respond quickly to so if you were to move in front of her and get very close to her she will do something but you may be out of position to deal with it so I just recommend waiting for a while let her get back towards the center of the room and then giving the the AI a bit of time to reset all right so this move here is really important what I do is I block the first flurry of attacks I roll upright twice I walk into her when she's above me again and then as soon as she starts flying I move back the motion on my left stick on my controller is basically I start it upright for like half a second and then I move it to down right very gradually like I don't go upright down right I do upright to right to down right very smooth motion once you get comfortable doing that you're you're going to solve that problem really quick uh there is a Korean YouTuber by the name of on Bal and he has uploaded a method to completely Dodge it but it is very difficult to do so I don't employ that strategy I just let her heal for like 10% block the first flurry roll twice and then do some movement to avoid the rest that's my personal strategy it's what I feel comfortable with but go check out Ang ball Ang Ball's video to see how he does it if you'd like all right so sometimes the boss can do a spark and then ready a move where she does a sweeping strike into a jump and downward strike just roll twice fairly easy to avoid this attack here is a huge opportunity for damage you can literally just roll through that down strike into the boss and you're fine for this stab again just roll back while mashing R1 this way you come out of the Roll doing some damage and you can get her caught all right so these sweeping strikes I just like to avoid this is the no spark hacking slash you can punish this one the one with no sparks you can and punish like I said it's very important that you're able to recognize that the other thing you'll notice that I'm not doing is hitting her more than twice if the second hit does not stagger her if the second hit does not stagger do not go in for a third hit it's extremely important and you will hear me yelling at myself during my final attempt when I do kill her that anytime I go in for three I get punished all right so here it's really important that you do not immediately mediately start guarding until she's about to move into you the reason for that is because you want to be able to have as much stamina as possible while you're blocking and you recover stamina more slowly while you're holding up your Shield so when she just jumps above you like that it's important that you just back up without holding your shield and then you make sure that you are back in one-handed mode this way you can use your Shield then you roll up to the right twice after you block the first string and then move up forward to down forward or up right to down right in one smooth motion on your stick and that's how you manage that piece of the fight it may seem like the boss is healing up to like 50% you know get just going back to full health during that flurry it feels that way when she's above 50% but when she's below 50% you'll actually realize that she's not healing up that much so blocking the first flurry is completely fine it's always going to feel like you need just one more hit to end the phase and it's also always going to feel like the boss is doing her best to extend the first phase and prevent you from seeing her true form I cannot stress how many times this has happened to me and I've tried to rush her down for that last hit only to get punished so it almost happened there I just kind of went for it and luckily I was able to dodge everything and then we get a good roll through this down slash and we're fine phase two is when things get really wild as soon as the phase starts you want to untarget the boss and run forward you're going to going to come across a little weird invisible wall but just move around it to the right and then curve to the left the boss will dive bomb behind you and this is your opportunity to use a rune Arc I am using R card's great rune for the added health and stamina I think godrick would be fine as well and then from here if you have any spells you'll see me use black flame a little bit um later on in the fight just to do some damage while she's in this flower state if you have anything to do damage there go for it not necessary but it does help you'll notice that I've switched to one-handed sword and board and you'll also notice that I messed up pretty dearly there and the boss has already recovered some health so the reason I switched to one-handed is because frankly I'm a little afraid of the boss in Phase 2 I'm not extremely comfortable with all of her moves like I am in Phase One this move especially where she flies and then dives into you and then does an unsparing slash I have the worst time recognizing that move however after she hits you once you can start to ready yourself for the hacken slash you'll also notice that I hit her three times there the boss has a very obvious stagger animation in Phase 2 however sometimes she is facing away from you and it's difficult to see you need to really train yourself to not go in on the boss if you can't actually tell what's happening to her it's better to just hit her once and assume that she's recovered then to try to hit her twice only to realize she has recovered and can now punish you and it's a bad trade all trades in this fight are bad okay so again whenever the boss flies in a strafe either left or right you want to strafe the opposite way to keep it even you always want to keep it square with this boss and you don't ever want to put yourself in a corner all right so this move here is a kick the kicks especially in Phase 2 are extremely tricky for me um what I do get into a pattern of later on in the fight is hitting her three times and then dodging the kick okay so that flying move right there is easy enough to avoid but because my flask timing just lined up perfectly I wasn't able to avoid it but basically she just flies down does an arcing slash lands and then does a stab you can avoid those both pretty easily as long as you know what to look for all right so whenever the boss does a straight vertical flight she's going to go right back down and stab the ground when that happens there's going to be an explosion of rot a second later so you just want to get behind the boss this way you can punish you can stuff the hacken slash move if your weapon is fast enough or if it has enough reach that you're able to hit her before she reaches you it's always stuffable however I just recommend trying to dodge but I just kind of got a little lucky there all right so this move here is the same as phase one it just looks different cuz she looks different but it's just a sweeping strike into an UPS slash into a slam easy enough to avoid when the boss flutters just a little above you she's going to do her flurry strike so the same exact strategy applies block the first set roll up right twice move up to the right and then down to the right in a smooth motion and you'll avoid the whole thing at least the the second and third set of flurries okay so the stab is the same same exact anim in same way to punish it just roll and mash R1 this way you come out swinging but don't go for a third hit unless she is staggered okay so here's the kick again I roll into it and you can do that as long as you land like right next to the boss you you're going to have a quick enough recovery time to where you can successfully uh hit the boss okay so I was able to recognize that flight she's sort of looking down at you and then you can just roll into her and hit her before she readies the the hack and slash again these regular sweeping strikes I just like to avoid I only really like going in on the boss in areas that I can punish unfortunately I made a pretty bad mistake there it cost me dearly she's basically back up to the health that she had when the phase started eventually we're going to start whittling her down I promise okay so you saw there there was a rod explosion I just got away from those you do want to have a few preserving boluses on you um it's just really helpful uh there's also an incantation uh o flame cleanse me or something like that that is very helpful as well that can cleanse the Scarlet Rod too so you'll notice that the boss basically flew straight up as I was about to punish her this can happen and it's why it's very important not to overcommit your hits if you overcommit your hits you're going to wind up getting punished in weird ways so sometimes the boss can do an ability land it and then fly straight up and do a stronger version of that and if you've already swung your sword one time then you're going to be overcommitted and get hit however if you just swung once you can reset and actually punish so this fairy move I have a somewhat difficult time dodging I was able to do it sometimes but not all the time basically you want to roll left once roll right and then delay the second roll right roll right again and then just wait however your timing has to be perfect it's really difficult but I'll explain it again when comes up all right so the boss is going to do a slam here you eventually start to recognize which one's going to be a slam and which one's going to be the flurry strike she flies up much higher and much more vertical when it's going to be a slam versus the flurry strike all right so we're just sort of letting the boss kind of reset herself here not trying to commit too much rolled perfectly into the kick that means I can punish hitter twice however the second hit didn't stagger so I waited and just Dodge the other kick so this is a regular slice into the slice and dice that one looks really similar to the flurry strike so I'm never comfortable punishing it too much but as long as you can avoid the slice and dice you will not heal her too much so don't worry about it all right so this slam is another really good opportunity for damage but it will result in a Scarlet Rod explosion so you got to be careful somehow I was able to start blocking this flurry strike at the perfect time and I had just enough stamina for two rolls literally could not have planned that any better if I had asked for it so it's really tough to recognize when she's going to flurry strike especially in Phase 2 cuz everything looks kind of similar but they are slightly different it's really the height of her hover that is the key differentiator between all of her flying moves all right so we do a sweeping slam we just roll into it get behind her however before we can do anything she flies straight up to do that again for this we can just get behind her we can hit her two or three times going in for a third here I could have gone for a fourth but I never like to do more than three in phase two for the simple fact that I want to manage my stamina that grab animation you can just do treat that just like a stab just roll backwards hit R1 as soon as you come out and you'll be able to punish all right so she will generally try to counter you with kicks that's kind of the way she does it a little difficult to recognize the kicks themselves but eventually you'll get a bit more comfortable with it and kind of feel out the pattern of those kicks all right so hacken slash roll into her it has Sparks so we're rolling back and then we are squaring the fight whenever she strapes that's a really important Habit to get into is square her strapes all right so this is a really important ability that she'll use when she's below 50% HP actually probably closer to 60% HP it's the same move that she opens the fight with so you treat it the exact same if she's close you can just run right through her or if you're at a distance just wait for her to get close roll backwards and then just hold up your shield and then as soon as the flower starts to shake that's when you can roll backwards again to avoid the Scarlet Rod explosion if you do get inflicted with Scarlet rot just quickly heal it off and use a flask to get your health back all right so here's the fairy strike again we're going to roll to the left we're going to roll to the right we're going to delay our second roll a bit only because of that other strike however what you really want to do is you want to delay the second right roll so much that when you roll immediately again you actually avoid two things at once so you have to roll very late to the right the second time this way you avoid two strikes simultaneously it's really difficult to do I did it on other attempts but I just couldn't get it consistently because I would get nervous but you just got to do a late second right roll so it's left right long delay right right and then wait for her to stab and you can just roll backwards through the stab to punish her all right so we finally had the boss under 50% HP somewhat consistently so now I'm really feeling the pattern and it's all starting to come together so this is the grab again treat it the same way you treat a stab just roll backwards and punish right away however like I said earlier she can just quickly go straight up in the air and come down with a slam after basically any move that she can do she can do that it's why it's very important not to overcommit your hits until you actually see her react to things so unfortunately I got clipped there and that led to Big damage for me trying to heal she gets yet another hit off and then she's going to do a sweeping strike going to have to wind up blocking luckily I knew that I was able to punish this move move here because it had no spark so I was able to get her back under under 50% HP and kind of get back to where I was the huge thing in Phase 2 is that it's demoralizing that's the whole thing about this fight it can be extremely demoralizing to fight melenia however if you just don't look at her health bar you will find yourself having a better time fighting her it's a lot easier said than done you're killing bosses the whole game you're looking at health bars the entire enre game but you just got to worry about fighting her don't worry about killing her worry about learning how to fight her all right so you saw there because I was against a wall she kind of had a much quicker time flying over me than uh if she was full screen so luckily I was able to get out of everything and then have an opportunity to throw two black flame Fireballs in there just to deal a little bit of damage nothing too significant it's just nice to be able to constantly deal damage to her this way you can end the fight quicker but if you don't have any magic don't worry about it use a bow whatever you want you don't even have to do anything you can just wait if you do want to go in on her after that flower attack you want to wait until the last pedal Falls you may take a little bit of scarlet rot damage there um if you're too quick however if you wait for the last pedal to fall the most you'll take is one tick uh if you find yourself taking more than that you're going in too early but you can get some decent damage on her uh as she's coming out of the flower all right so we have her health below the name which is a really good sign okay so we're avoiding the kicks I really don't like doing anything with them just let her do her thing she does not wait nearly as long to do anything in phase two is Phase One all right so because she's just hovering just above us this is going to be a flurry strike unfortunately the health goes back above her name again it can be demoralizing but it's just about learning that's all this fight is is learning learning eventually you'll kill her okay so after that flurry strike she's got some distance so what I'm attempting to do is just kind of get away from her This Way She Moves away from that wall you really don't ever want to fight her against walls it's not a good idea all right so she's coming in this is going to be an arc slash she's going to land and then stab we can roll through the stab get one or two hits off so we get two we're going in for a third because she got staggered and then we just roll backwards through the kick beautiful if only they could all be like that all right so we got the health below the r and rot which is great this move always kind of trips me up in phase two cuz she has so many other moves that look like it so I may not always punish that but just roll once she goes up roll again for the down strike and you're okay all right so we get three hits in we back up she's only got a little bit more to go all right so she comes in with the slash now she's going to do an unpark hacking slash and then we can roll through that unfortunately I was slow on the punish but she just went straight up which I knew was fine as long as I didn't overcommit to more than one hit I could punish no problem so two hits three times a lady and then we back up again and then we're basically home free at this point we just got to make sure we don't mess up don't give her any opportunities to heal too much and then you're fine so we have a sparked hacken slash we just roll through that and then backwards to avoid the followup she Glides over I follow her to get myself away from the wall and now she's going to do a up strike into a slam I'll go ahead and punish that you'll notice that I backed off it's cuz I couldn't really recognize what it was I go to punish she flies straight up to do a slam no problem I get behind her or to her side rather you never want to be too close to that explosion because it can clip you and interrupt your attack and cause you to take a bunch of damage if you punish too early so I didn't want to go in on her there because I felt like my swing would have been too slow had I done so and I just didn't want to make it so she could deal any damage to me I wanted to be as safe as possible to end this fight that said that final hit was super greedy I don't actually know why I did it and I didn't even realize I did it and when you watch the final fight and hear my reaction I'm going to be just as surprised as everybody else cuz it was sort of like my brain just took over and or my maybe my muscle memory just took over and I saw that what any hit is going to kill her so I just did it um but I really should have waited at the end there and that's it that is the strategy for melenia the SE blade of Micha goddess of rot this fight took me about two and a half days probably like 16 17 hours to do like I said in the beginning there are a lot of other strategies to fight her you can use katanas and stack bleed you can do frost damage you can overow her with jumping r2s with colossal weapons there are other ways to go about this fight that are admittedly a lot easier however in my opinion summoning Spirits stacking certain infusions and ultimately changing your play style just to fight one boss isn't necessarily the most fun thing to do especially because you get kind of attached to how you're building your character over time and having to relearn how to play with different weapons and different combat styles for one boss just isn't great so I wanted to make sure that this boss was doable with a basic build yeah I'm using a great sword but you can use a long sword it'll just take you a little bit longer the boss does not have any Poise at all she has some super armor or hyper armor in certain moves but for the most part when I stagger her with a great swword she'll get staggered with a long sword the great swword just has longer reach and does a bit more damage I just wanted to show that this is doable without anything extra and I hope I've proven that to you and I hope this guide has been helpful I will leave it with my kill attempt uh warning there's some strong language here this came after two and a half days of grinding I did stream this so thank you so much to everybody in the chat for hanging out and cheering me on and getting hype along with me uh it was a really really

Title: Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree (Miquella's Haligtree) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring
Video ID: hUcxyz42UaU
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat loretta knight of the halig tree located in nicholas haley tree you have probably fought a boss very similar to this back in korean manor if you've been following along and doing all the bosses with me this time though you're fighting the real thing and she's a good bit stronger first thing you'll probably notice is that her pole arm is also a magic casting staff so it has two different types of attacks the magic typically comes from the butt end of the staff the base and then the physical attacks come from the actual blade on the top you have to be very careful with this boss obviously she is mounted and you don't get a horse for this fight not exactly fair but the reason you have to be careful is because she can move quite quickly and when she strafes around if you're close to her there's a really good chance that she's gonna fire a glintstone orbit you so you gotta be very careful with that whenever you see her jump and strafe around just hold up your shield because a spell may be coming very quickly at you you don't want to stand behind the boss for too long uh if you do you just want to be ready for a donkey kick so just always be aware of that that can do a lot of damage and also set you up to deal with these glintstone blades this bow and arrow is really cool and it's a lot less scary than it seems it's big and it does deal a decent amount of damage but it's really nothing to worry about the arrow itself actually moves quite slow and you can dodge it pretty easily just roll into it unless you're at a big distance then you want to roll to the side occasionally this attack was kind of rare for me the boss will imbue her blade with some magic and do some big sweeping strikes for that you can uh just it's two hits so just roll to the left if you were on her uh right side where the blade actually is near her hand just roll to the left and then you can roll into her for the second hit all throughout this fight so yep this is it you just roll to the left and roll in for the second one no big deal so throughout the fight the boss will summon these glintstone blades around her it'll constantly happen the trick with these to dodge them is when it actually makes the casting sound like if they're already out and then they make another sound that sound is indicating that they are now going to travel to you so they basically released their position however they still have a little bit of travel time so you want to be careful for that you're not going to want to dodge right away however in phase 2 which the boss will hit at about 50 or lower she will now have two sets of those blades that come out separately so you'll need to dodge twice it's not exactly moving any faster but there's just more of them and the tricky part is that sometimes when they're releasing she can do a whole bunch of other stuff such as take out a four point bow and arrow and start doing a bunch of other crazy moves and weaving it all together the bow and arrow in phase two is mostly the same except it obviously shoots four arrows so the major thing to look out for there is actually the arrows in the middle the one on the bottom will typically hit the floor and you won't really have to worry about it too much the one on top will arc away so it's really about the two in the middle that you got to look out for the same sort of deal applies if you are close enough you can just roll right through it just roll forward if you are at a distance however you want to roll to the side or possibly even do a very late roll forward depending on if all four are coming towards you but you really don't ever want to be at a good distance with this boss you want to be close so you will notice that the sweeping strikes are now improved uh here in phase two it now has an additional hit but again it's just a big sweeping strike so just pay close attention to her her hand and when the hand moves towards you that's when you want to roll but luckily i was able to get the boss trapped in a corner that had never happened before so i was able to get a decent amount of damage on her so just a few more hits and she's going to go down and do a big sweeping strike into another one and then she twirls it around and summons her glindstone swords that's it that is loretta knight of the halek tree you get a trophy for this one you also get the loretta's mastery spell and then you get her weapon as well and that's it all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go

Title: Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader (Ringleader's Evergaol) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring
Video ID: brPG400OWTQ
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat alecto black knife ring leader located in the ring leaders ever jail up in the moonlight altar region of leone of the lakes so this is your typical black knife assassin fight with the exception that alecto has a couple of spells up her sleeve so the base attacks remain the same she has that carving attack on the ground that lasts a really long time you just gotta roll really late for that and then she also has a leaping uh overhead sort of like a helm splitter that is really your big opportunity to punish her because she's very susceptible to backstabs after that attack it has a long recovery window so you can just jump right in there grab a backstab so you saw that the boss did a big aoe explosion that can one shot you so you have to be very very careful for that what you want to do is once she jumps towards you or when she's about to jump towards you you want to roll away or if you have enough time just run if you block the attack there's a chance you'll survive however it does a surprising amount of damage so you do want to be careful and that whole helix whirlwind that is the damage radius so you got to be careful the really cool yet frustrating part about this fight is the camera the boss moves in really cool ways and it's really fun to watch her move but it does cause the camera to flip out so she has a blood arc there very similar to bloody fingernaires from earlier on in the game who you may have thought so you just dodged through that not a big deal however if it hits you it can deal a decent amount of stun damage to you and then she can follow up really easily so you have to be careful one thing i do want to mention is that if you have the brier armor which you get by defeating elmer of the briar in the shaded castle up in mount gelmere once you defeat him you can purchase the armor set if you use the briar armor this boss becomes trivial because rolling into people with the briar armor does nominal damage but to this boss it will also interrupt anything it's doing i had the set on in one attempt and i was basically bullying her and i figured this would make a great guy because not everybody likes to use armor like me so i didn't include it and i skipped and just you know did another attempt with basic armor but if you had the briar set use it it's really really cheap okay so we have seen all the abilities for the fight uh one of the things to watch out for is the boss does have a grab the grab is quite deadly it will likely one shot you she sort of groats you which is kind of sick but deadly if this happens i mean you really have no recourse but like i said you can interrupt her moves by hitting her out of them she has very low poise that's why the briar armor comes in handy so that's the grab right there you can just roll backwards uh you basically have to be in her face to get caught by it like she's got to be able to reach it very quickly otherwise you can avoid it but if you are hooked up by it you're basically dead but that's basically the fight so what i'll do is i will let it play out and then you can watch the rest and hopefully it all helps you out with my strategy but if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye [Music] you

Title: Godskin Duo (Crumbling Farum Azula) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: fG-js4bUeJs
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat the godskin duo in crumbling farm azula i'm going to start off by saying i don't like this boss i don't find it fun i don't think there's anything to be learned through fighting them it's not interesting it's just annoying and anybody that i've spoken to feels basically the same about this fight there was one person in my stream while i was doing it that actually liked it and that's that's great but i just i don't like him okay so that's my venting out of the way my general advice for this fight since you've undoubtedly fought both a noble and an apostle at least once so far in this game my general advice is to just leave the noble alone don't ever hit the godskin noble what i noticed is that if you leave the noble alone it will never become super aggressive towards you and what i mean by that is that when the apostle dies for the first time you're gonna have to fight four of them basically but when the apostle dies the first time the noble will start running after you a bit more but when it summons a new apostle it will kind of leave you alone again i just noticed that the apostle becomes very aggressive all the time if you hit him at least once but if you just leave him alone then he it's not that he'll leave you alone he certainly won't but he won't be as aggressive i'm not exactly sure if this is just a placebo effect if i only really tried it a couple times because i was just getting very frustrated with the fight and i figured there might be a gimmick here but i did notice at least in my attempts that i just never hit the noble and he basically left me alone so this fight requires you to use the pillars in the room however each boss is able to break the pillars really easily in their respective phase twos the apostles phase two have a bit more of aoe attacks so they are much more likely to be the ones destroying the pillars versus anybody else if you were to put the noble into phase two you would have to deal with his big marshmallow rolling ability which is just a nightmare to deal with even on its own let alone when you have an apostle rolling around trying to slice you with a fishing hook that can also stab you with the butt end so just leave the noble alone can't stress that enough the apostles attacks are a bit easier to punish especially because uh in phase two when it gets all like stretchy you can get in on its legs deal some damage and then when it you know goes back to size you can typically even get a couple follow-up attacks there so really just keep going after the apostles that's basically my only advice um the the all the attacks are the exact same as every other apostle and noble fight that you have fought be very careful when the noble is on the other side of a pillar its attacks can 100 still go through and deal full damage to you so you have to pay very close attention to where they are at all times as best you can and also pay very close attention to the audio cues for the fireball attack as well as the uh i would say like the special moves that the apostle that the noble can do when he sort of gets the demon souls ps3 version penetrator sword where it sort of fades in and out and has like a streak on it when it starts doing that you want to get away from it it really shouldn't do it too often to you but it can happen even if you haven't done anything to the boss it can still very much happen so just pay very close attention whenever you see that you know hyper speed um you know saber just try to get away from him or just be ready to roll at the right time so this is what i'm talking about you can get in on the apostles legs and deal a decent amount of damage just when it's attacking so that's why i recommend going after the apostle it's just a bit easier to manage these bosses do cheat what i mean by that is that the second you press square to heal or x on xbox whatever whenever you press your flask button they will summon a fireball within a frame i don't like when bosses can read your inputs i don't find it interesting it just feels cheap and both of them can do it and what's frustrating is because they can break the pillars you can't rely on the pillars to guard against fireballs or any other moves consistently throughout the fight so you just got to kind of deal with it but again you're seeing that i'm just leaving the noble alone and when it's you know during the downtime when the apostle is dead i'm just chilling out just running away from him staying away not attacking at all because from what i've noticed like i said when he summons an apostle he kind of leaves you alone again so otherwise he becomes very aggressive he's always the one chasing you down chasing you down and you kind of can't get away from him you know you're the belle of the ball but at least when you don't attack him and again could have just been a placebo effect for the one or two attempts that i figured it out um he just didn't seem that interested in me or as interested as he could be so that is the fight i have nothing else to say i'm just gonna let it play out um unfortunately i did leave my mic open on my regular recording software so you're gonna hear me talking to the chat and complaining a little bit about this bike so i just found it so frustrating but i'll let it play out as is and then you know there's a bit of strong language in there just letting you know but that's it all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in

tried to use a witching branch i think that's i have to pee so bad [Music] [Music] definitely yeah oh my [ __ ] god [Music] are you serious [Music] uh my my physic flask is um the significant shield plus all right are you gonna phase two automatically like you did before [Music] okay just gotta separate them now the apostle doesn't want anything to do with me yeah buckets i think so too actually although now i don't know because now the apostle won't do anything all right [Music] but yeah one of these days in particular come on [Music] oh come on [Music] i'm literally just doing like one [Music] got him holy [ __ ] wow thanks everybody that last 10 seconds was quite harrowing i was gonna try to back away to heal let's take a couple notes here

Title: Dragonlord Placidusax HIDDEN BOSS (Crumbling Farum Azula) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring
Video ID: 2c4hAInTJbc
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to find and defeat dragon lord placidio sax in crumbling farm azula the site of grace that you want to start off at to find him is called beside the great bridge which you should just reach through your regular adventuring through this area and then you want to follow this path and we're gonna find his hidden location uh really interesting boss fight and really interesting location uh shout out to the folks on my stream for actually telling me about this i did spot these messages and all these blood stains here but kind of forgot where this was because this place is a little confusing but thank you to everybody for pointing this out to me and i know a lot of folks were looking forward to this fight on my stream so thank you so basically what you want to do is drop down on these platforms and then eventually you're going to reach that crumbling ruin over there and on that ruin are let's call them tombs i think that's what the message says anyway one of the tombs is empty and so what you're going to do is lay down in the tomb and then you're going to be transported to the arena with the boss so you're going to lie down and then get transported so i'll skip the cutscene here you don't need to see that you'll see that yourself and then basically you just get transported right to the boss arena so no more platforming nothing it's just the boss this boss is really cool probably one of the coolest dragon fights they've ever done in this game so basically it is a four-headed dragon that only has two heads left so if you notice to the right of the one in the middle there's just a hole where a neck should be and then one of the necks is just hanging off so really really cool throughout the fight the boss will summon a lightning storm and as this is happening you just need to consistently run in a circle and then eventually three lightning strikes will come down around you so after the third one you can go in on the boss i recommend just getting one or two attacks into the front of the boss running to its tail but do not attack the tail right away because one of the heads is going to look behind and breathe fire on you so it is very important that you are not near the boss while this is happening if you're able to you can get to the complete opposite side and you're mostly safe but throughout this fight i just recommend taking it slow the boss moves relatively slowly so it has a lot of easily telegraphed moves and a lot of abilities you can't exactly punish but the ones that you can punish you can get a lot of damage on so when the boss reads its left hand it's going to use this lightning incantation on its hand it's going to swipe and then you can follow the boss as it breathes fire you can just follow its tail not you want to be close to the base of the tail because that can still get eclipsed by fire a little bit into the tail you want to be then you can just follow it around until the tail stops that will mean that the boss is just breathing fire forward only and nothing to the side and then you can go in on the tail so we're gonna do that several times throughout the fight but here after the lightning storm get behind the boss you're gonna breathe fire on its own tail to get you away from it you can go in and get a couple attacks it'll do a very weak tail swipe because it's tail's been chopped off and then again raises his left hand you roll through it gonna get near the base of the tail maybe the midpoint's a better reference and then once it stops you can go in on it you can get up to four hits with a colossal weapon here maybe five if you want to get saucy but i recommend again just taking it slow whenever the boss sits still and then pushes itself up with his front legs and roars that's the lightning storm just running the circle until three landing strikes land behind you and then you're good to go the boss can also use a lightning incantation on its right hand that is just a typical slam but as we get into the later phases of the fight the boss will rake each hand back after it slams them down the boss can sometimes just sort of quickly fly away from you and then it'll breathe fire in front of itself i do not recommend trying to chase it down or rolling through the fire it's not worth it and the boss is very quick with it so there's a possibility that you can't even do it anyway but lightning storm three strikes go in on the boss you can typically jump and get one or two hits on the chest but you always want to be ready for that left hand it swipes you track the tail once it stops then you can go in for three or four hits if not more depending on the weapon that you're using once the boss reaches about 60 hp it will begin phase two this is where things get really cool the boss will float up and disappear and now what you have to do is just move the camera around until you see a storm cloud this first storm cloud the boss is just going to crash into you you just got to roll through then he disappears again this is something that always kind of catches me off guard you can use the audio cues if you have a headset or headphones or something uh it's really easy to tell at least in what general direction the boss is going to come from so just listen out look for the storm cloud and then after comes out of a storm cloud it's always going to use a lightning incantation on one of its hands and then you just sort of repeat the process if it's using it on its left hand then you just roll through it track the tail get damage on it while it's breathing fire if it's the right hand it'll slam you can get one hit on its chest then i recommend backing away it does this attack here where it plants its weapon into the ground i recommend just running away i tried a whole bunch to see if you could roll through it it doesn't seem possible i'm sure i'll be made a liar of by angbal at some point in one of his videos where he does this without taking any damage but i don't think it's worth trying to roll through it it shouldn't kill you at this stage of the game but it will deal a ton of damage and just waste the flask so just don't even go for it but you'll notice here that now the boss is disappearing a bit more frequently and basically all of its claw incantations it will rake backwards so you're not exactly safe after you roll through it the first time if it's pushing it down onto the ground then it's gonna rake back if it's just a swipe you're okay but if it's actually gonna hit the ground with its hand it's almost guaranteed to rake backwards so you gotta be careful you see it there it was a rake backwards there so i do not recommend being where i just was which is under its front hands you don't want to be there reason being if the boss were to decide to turn around to breathe fire onto you the odds of you getting out either unscathed or without dying are slim when the boss breathes fire behind it it's going to start doing it with one head and then the second head is going to chime in and do it again and cover the whole area that's why the fire is so big when it breathes because it's generally coming out of two heads so just keep that in mind but from here and out we're basically going to repeat the process the boss disappears you look out for the audio cues you roll through the first big thing that it does after it comes out of the storm cloud you just track it along here comes out for that attack there you want to roll forward and to the left the reason being is because later on when the boss gets lower in hp it's going to start doing this crazy laser beam move after it comes out of a storm cloud and then basically every time it does a full disappearing act and you have to track it out of a storm cloud what's going to happen is the laser beams and that storm cloud attack that it comes back with generally also lifts up rocks so it's really difficult to dodge the last one that it starts doing and frankly that's where the fight for me personally started to get a little out of control but luckily it doesn't start doing it until it's pretty low on hp so as long as you fight cleanly throughout everything before it you should have plenty of flasks to make it through that portion of the fight so you saw there boss slammed its lightning weapon into the ground we just ran away no big deal the boss roars we get the electricity storm however what the boss can start doing generally below 20 hp is it can start a lightning storm and then disappear and then when that happens that's when it's gonna start doing the new stuff with the laser beams that'll happen pretty soon here i could have gone in for an attack there but it wasn't giving me the pattern i really wanted and what ends up happening is it throws rocks at me if you're not blocking that can one-shot you so what i recommend doing is if you're ever trying to move from the front of the boss towards the back hold up your shield while doing it if it hasn't really attacked you in a while reason being it can start slinging rocks at you from the ground and they can one shot you it's very very deadly and very frustrating that happens this late in the fight but that's how it is okay so it's going to raise up its left hand do a claw mark incantation we track the tail we do the same thing so this is really the bread and butter here this is where you get the most damage on the boss i will say if you're able to consistently attack the boss from the front and get some really big damage in you can stagger this boss and get a full riposte i was able to do it once or twice however i found myself to be more comfortable exploiting this pattern in the ai where i track the tail and deal damage that way just because it led to a lot less random deaths so the ball starts a lightning storm and then disappears when this happens you want to turn around and look for the lightning bolts thank god i was blocking right there otherwise otherwise i would have died where the concentration of lightning bolts are in that storm that is where the boss is going to come from so you just want to roll through him or just block and you'll be okay but then when it lands it's going to do a ton of laser beam attacks and i just recommend blocking and waiting i don't recommend trying to get in on it it's very possible that you can i actually think it's definitely possible i got pretty close one time but the time it takes to get close to the boss while it's doing those laser beams it's just so long that you're better off just waiting it out so again doing the same pattern here avoid the tail it's you know go in once it's done breathing fire and then you rinse and repeat the boss will start disappearing a lot more at this point once it's around 20 hp so you kind of just got to deal with that but everything else remains the same when the boss starts coming in from the storm cloud however after it does the laser beams you'll notice that it starts pushing more with the incantation arm rather than swiping at you that only happens when it's coming out of the storm cloud so what you want to do at that stage of the game is start late rolling up and to the left this way you avoid the shock wave and the rocks that come along with it it's a little tough to tell when it's happening but generally when it disappears you want to roll up and to the left as it's coming out of a storm cloud when it does these close range disappearing acts that's really not that big of a deal it's either just going to swipe with one of its paws not really anything to worry about it's not new attacks that you haven't seen before they're just coming quicker because you can't see the full telegraph as the boss was coming back from disappearing but again it's the same pattern over and over that you can exploit pretty easily and get big damage on somehow my sword completely whiffed that second hit so i got a little greedy went for a fourth starts up another lightning storm very important that during that lightning storm you try to tell where the quickest exit is for you you don't want to end up running backwards and it not doing anything for you and getting struck by lightning getting tons of damage dealt to you so here's the laser beams again we're literally just going to wait i recommend holding up your shield because if you're familiar with dark eater madeir from dark souls 3 the laser beam is kind of similar it's the same pattern every time but the pattern is somewhat erratic and tough to predict unless you just study it it's not going left and right and then left and right it's doing like left further left right even further right like it's it's really crazy of a pattern so you got to be careful with it you saw there that i failed that roll that's kind of what i'm talking about after the boss does the laser beams it seems like when it's coming out of the big storm cloud things get a bit different and a bit more deadly and because that sort of threw me off you can tell that things kind of got a little out of control here luckily luckily i was able to make it to the tail in time and i sacrificed doing damage in favor of just healing but i took a risky hit here somehow got out of the flame and then did a jumping r2 to finish it off but it did kind of start falling apart at the end there luckily i recognized the pattern early enough although probably at the very last second to be able to get behind the boss track the tail and do it again but that's it that is dragon lord placidus axe i'm probably butchering the name that's how it looks to me but that's the boss if you have any questions

hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat sir gideon off near the all-knowing in lane del ashton capital if you're wondering how to get to this boss just keep playing the game eventually you will have to come here gideon is pretty easy however he is really strong the two spells you need to look out for especially are the glenstone sorceries it's the swords that appear around his head and it is that i don't even know what you want to call that magic spear fireball craziness that does so much damage he also has access to the spell that i currently have equipped which is scarlet aeonia if you fought melania this should give you some nightmares however it is nowhere near as powerful as hers you do need to watch out though because if you get too close to it it will inflict scarlet rot kind of quickly gideon can flask once so just kind of pretend like he has one and a half health bars and then it won't be as demoralizing but if you're able to get him into a corner or get him backing up against a wall you can just bully him he can't do anything he has very low poise you can interrupt him out of more or less every single spell that he tries to cast and if you actually knock him down while he's using scarlet aeonia and floating upwards you will completely put him on his butt and you can just go in on him so once you kind of bully him into this corner over here this walled off area the fight is over you do need to look out though because if he is able to successfully summon one of reichard's skulls that will follow a trail and then a couple seconds after it starts trailing there will be explosions on along that trail so that is something you gotta watch out for and what he will often do is while it's exploding he will actually summon more spells and use them through the explosion catching you off guard so if you can get close to him and bully him into a corner you can just own the fight and he can't really do anything so that's the general strategy but if he starts going other places just try to back off dodge the blue magic as best you can the rest of it not that it can be ignored but you can punish it a lot more easily the blue magic just comes out so fast in this fight but that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the blue join button below this video don't forget to follow me on twitter and join my discord the links for those are in the description below as always i'll speak johnny cage thank you so much for watching and i'll see you next time bye you

Title: Maliketh, the Black Blade (Crumbling Faram Azula) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: 0sBwcogn6Sg
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat malekith the black blade as well as the beast clergyman which is the phase before malekith starts i want to show you how to get a very important item first however which will help you a good deal against malekith if you can time using it correctly so the timing window is pretty tight but it basically parries the boss for you then you can get a ton of follow-up damage it has to use at specific times but that item is the blasphemous claw and it can be found in crumbling farm ozila we're going to start here from the beside the great bridge site of grace and then you're going to follow the path that i'm showing you and then once you reach the treasure chest you will get invaded by an npc invader and you need to kill this invader and then he will drop the item automatically so it's not actually in the treasure chest it's on the invader it himself you can just cheese this invader and there's no shame in my game when it comes to fighting npc invaders especially ones that can one shot or two shot me what you can do is once he invades just run back to the ladder climb up and then he will follow you you do have to be careful because some of the beastmen can follow you as well but once he reaches the top just knock him off either using a spell or a big weapon or something and he'll fall down and he won't really take any fall damage but if you also mix in some poison or some scarlet rot or something you'll just be able to cheese him to death and he'll really never be able to touch you too much and then once he's dead he'll drop the blast from his claw and that's the item we're looking for he also drops his armor set which is quite nice and then you can open the treasure chest and move on with the rest of the dungeon so let's get started on the fight and we're going to begin with phase one which is the beast clergyman i start off this fight by popping a rune arc outside i am using reichard's great rune because i like the extra health and stamina that it gives i find beast clergyman's attacks to be incredibly difficult to successfully kind of roll through so i end up blocking a lot of them and because they all drain a ton of stamina the extra that you get from my card's great rune really comes in handy for me okay so the beast clergyman has a variety of attacks his right hand has a shiv because i guess he just got out of prison and then the left hand is an incantation hand that he will bury into the ground at various points and do different b steel incantations so if you bought anything from garank earlier on in the game then he has basically grant's full inventory although i do not think that malik is grant i think they're two different people so when he digs his hand his left hand into the ground and pulls it out a ring of beast claws is gonna come out however if you are far away from him when he buries his left hand of the ground he can chase you down and drag his hand through the floor and then throw the beast claws at you so if his left hand is in the floor something is coming after you if he drags it back in sort of like a backhand motion he's gonna pick up a rock chuck it at you if he drags it on the ground in a forehand arc that means that he's gonna throw like a series of stones at you those take a ton of stamina when you block so you have to be very careful and just try your best to roll through them if you ever get too close he will dash away with a shiv attack you have to be very careful and just watch where he's going he has a one-two swipe that he will always follow up with a very quick third so he does one two and then he can delay the third hit or if you're super close to him what he can end up doing is chucking a rock at you while he falls back you notice there that he dug both hands into the ground that time after being up on his legs when he does that a huge earthquake is going to happen he's going to rip stones out of the ground those are going to go up and then a couple seconds later they're going to fall down however it's not a complete 100 coverage aoe instead it's actually in very specific areas so if you do not see rocks coming out of the ground where you're standing you are safe for the most part however when they fall down you have to be aware of where that safe zone was because sometimes you can end up getting clipped so sometimes it's safer to just run out as the rocks are in the air get some safe distance watch them fall down he will generally follow that earthquake move up when he tries to get out in the dust he will either throw a series of rocks at you or he will just do sort of like a backflip kind of twist physical attack that you gotta watch out for once the boss reaches about 60 hp malikith the black blade is revealed this boss is pretty crazy but he's actually kind of easy to punish you just have to know what to look out for so you want to have the blasphemous claw ready to go and whenever the boss's sword glows gold it's very distinct it's not just the gold particles coming off is an actual gold shine that comes off the blade for a second when he is close to you as that's happening that's when you want to use the item and then if you're successful you'll basically parry the boss and you get a ton of damage on them so it's right here you saw the blade gold glow gold and then you can go in for some extra damage so you can kind of use it infinitely i think i use it twice in this fight and i figured you know what this is a little too good so let me show how to dodge everything else when the boss does big sweeping strikes not these it's when he goes up on his hind legs and starts twirling around you may think that you're supposed to go in on him when he does that you are not the reason being is because he's gonna bury his sword very similar to what he just did there so you want to lock onto this boss in my opinion even though he does move a lot and he is a big boss and generally my advice is to not lock on to big bosses the fact is is that you always want to have this boss in front of you that's very very important reason being is because all of his sword attacks will deal more or less blood flame damage to you with the added benefit of it actually depleting your maximum hp so you have to be very very careful to avoid his big sweeping attacks whenever he buries his blade in the ground it's going to explode and deal blood flame damage you have to be very careful to avoid it so as you can see here when he digs the blade in with both hands big earthquake is coming be very careful with that eventually the health reduction will wear off but it takes a while and the chunks that come off your health bar are so devastating that you may just want to try to get behind a pillar and heal up for a little bit before going back in on the boss so when he gets up on his hind legs and does big sweeps do not go in because a big sword slam is coming and you do not want to get caught in it but as long as you stay relatively close to the boss and you roll through his big sweeping motions you should be fine the other thing i want to mention is that when the boss is flying around he can stall in the air and shoot beams out of his blade those come in both vertical and horizontal fashions typically he will do two vertical ones you just roll to the left and to the right and then for the horizontal ones you just roll forward through those and then you may be able to chase them down for a little bit of damage but that's the fight i personally found malachith easier than beast clergyman just because you can sort of block a bit more with malaketh however you are suffering a penalty for blocking because every time he hits you with his blade you get your hp reduced so it's a little tricky but the key is just stay close to him unless he is burying the sword in the ground if he's doing that an explosion's going to occur and you don't want to be near it the other big thing that you want to watch out for and this is really the final thing is that if you get knocked down by one of those blood flame attacks what's going to happen is when you are paralyzed on the ground your health bar will not be depleting your health will just stay the same but as soon as you get up your health will begin ticking down so don't assume that just because you're on the ground and your health bar isn't moving like that ticking damage is not occurring that does not mean that it will not occur once you've recovered so if you're able to get away from the boss after you get up heal up get back up to full whatever full may be at that moment because your health bar has been depleted and then start going in again you really don't want too much distance between you and this boss because he can chase you down super super easily that's the fight i hope this has been helpful if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go

Title: Godfrey, First Elden Lord & Hoarah Loux - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: _z0rTz8CeSM
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to defeat godfrey first eldon lord and his second form horolu warrior godfrey is mostly the same as he was with his shade that you fought earlier on in the game however he has a second phase himself so this fight is technically a four-phase fight with each phase happening every roughly 25 percent so godfrey phase one isn't too difficult he does have a lot of stomps that you just need to roll through the trick is to just stay really close to him this allows you to roll through all of his axe attacks and you can also jump across some shock waves so whenever he spins the axe a couple times above his head he's gonna always slam it into the ground and then a second later he's gonna put his foot into the axe creating a bigger shock wave that you need to jump over and then you need to get out of the big aoe that's about to explode on the ground you'll notice that i'm alternating between rolling through the shock waves and jumping over them if i'm close i'm going to roll them if i'm not close i'm going to jump them the reason you want to get into this habit in particular is because for phase two the shock waves become full screen and they're even more devastating so you want to be able to react to them accordingly this way you don't expose yourself to too much follow-up damage because orlu can basically one-shot you if you're not careful that move there where he swings the axe and then drags it behind him and flips it over that is one of the best opportunities for free follow-up damage that you can find in this fight because what's gonna happen is he's going to drag the axe and you don't even need to block you can just go to his left as you see here i'm literally just walking left as he's doing it and then he uh just sort of falls all right so luckily i was actually able to do this without getting him into phase two which was pretty neat that never happened to me before but this is the start of phase two you can jump over the shock wave as long as you are not in his face that's kind of the trick and all the other moves stayed the exact same except now the shock wave is full screen and you just want to jump over it horolu has a ton of grab attacks the one where he will sort of rake his hands right here that is the deadliest one it's really difficult to react to what i recommend doing is trying to back away from him and then as he gets really close to you you want to roll he can basically grab you within a couple frames of touching you so like once he's in your face he can do it within a couple frames so it's really difficult to react to what i recommend doing is just backing away and then rolling backwards and you shouldn't get caught by it this roar here is a shockwave luckily it does no damage so it's actually not the end of the world if you get hit by it he can only do a couple of follow-up attacks after it the most devastating one is when he leaps in the air and then crashes into the ground because then he's going to emit a bigger shock wave that will fill the screen and you need to get out of the aoe and then when he goes into his own phase two that becomes even more deadly so you see that i just sort of try my best to roll away from that grab that is the most devastating one out of all of them it's very very important that you get away from it if you have a wondrous flask with the opaline bubble tier for the shield it will save you you won't take hardly any damage from that grab but that's only one use so you got to be careful so right here he jumps into the ground and then punches the ground again that second punch if you are close to him can deal damage to you and knock you down more or less sealing your fate because then the big shock wave is gonna come and you're not gonna be able to get away from it his kicks here in phase one of horolu are pretty frustrating because they are very delayed and when they are so delayed it's very difficult to judge them and the kicks create big shock waves and the rocks of those shock waves can deal damage to you so it's very important that for those shock waves in phase one you roll forward and not backward if you roll backward you are going to take damage from the rocks that spawn out of the ground so always roll into those shock waves or jump over them if you are far enough away during the horolu fight you want to be very careful not to put yourself into a corner it's much easier said than done but just be aware of your surroundings because if you were in a corner like i'm kind of putting myself into here it's very difficult to get out of and it's also very easy to get caught up in grabs because you're used to the timing of rolling away from them while you're far enough away but if you're close to him the timing changes so you got to be really really careful if you're able to get in horolu's face for long enough you just want to roll up and to the right away from his attacks basically every single one of his attacks with the exception of this big slam here you can just roll up and to the right and be fine but you see there that i got away from him and jumped over the second shockwave allowing me to get to safety in time for the big aoe so luckily he didn't get me with any of those monkey paw grabs very grateful for that this was easily the cleanest attempt i had ever had against him no joke i had gotten him within one or two hits a couple times but managed to mess it up somehow but rolling up into the right against horolu when you're close to him is really really important and you got to be careful because when he's close to you his kicks can kick you on both ends when he kicks up that can deal damage and of course when he slams down the aoe can deal damage but if you're rolling up into the right you won't get caught in any of the rocks you shouldn't get caught in any of the shock waves his roar you can just eat it get knocked down it's fine it's not a big deal you don't take damage from it you don't even take stamina damage from it and it should give you enough time to understand what's coming next but that's it it's a really difficult fight took me a while but it is doable without any infusions or anything so good luck if you have any questions please feel free to leave a

Title: Radagon of the Golden Order & Elden Beast - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: qAIqsfKTCDw
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet johnny cage here back with another guide for elden ring this time i'm going to show you how to take down radigan of the golden order and the elden beast before we actually fight the bosses i do want to very quickly mention that after you defeat eldon beast you can still back up your save and select different endings by restoring the save elden ring works like dark souls 3 where once you beat the boss you select an ending it's not automatic like other games okay so radigan is a really difficult boss very befitting for the stage of the game he has a lot of hammer swings that can do different things there's a few you want to watch out for though when he charges up to do a backswing he's always going to follow up same thing with the forehand however when the hammer glows for a backswing that is going to result in him shooting gold onto the ground and then he waits for it to explode so he's actually vulnerable during that waiting period just go in on him he can do an up scoop into a two-handed hammer crash you can roll through that no problem he can be staggered and believe it or not he does have a pretty lenient stagger time for phase two he always starts it off with a glowing foot stomp you can just jump over that shock wave a little difficult to time but once you try this boss enough you'll get used to when he's gonna move into phase two so you know to look out for it all of his moves in this phase uh kinda remain the same however they will deal more damage and now he can teleport around he starts using all sorts of incantations that you can actually get throughout the game the most annoying of which is this one right here where he shoots five orbs into you very very frustrating especially because he can do it coming out of a teleport you can also do it while in midair the only advice i have to give you is that after he's coming out of the teleport pay very close to his hand and what it's doing all right so this move here is really sick you can actually roll through the shock waves you can jump over the first one but the really important thing to notice is that there are three rings that spawn in front of him you cannot roll through the shock waves on those rings so you want to make sure that you you have some distance between you and the boss before you start rolling otherwise you will get caught in those rings and that's guaranteed damage when the boss is teleporting like i mentioned before he can teleport straight into your face it's very important that you roll backwards from that teleport explosion otherwise you will take damage this grab is a lot easier to deal with than you might think all you want to do is stay very close to him and keep moving to the right eventually the boss will stop tracking you and just grab and then once he stops tracking you and you notice that he's kind of falling behind you in his turning animation just roll and you'll be okay so again the rest of the moves are kept from phase one the lightning bolt slam you can roll through that and then just get away because he has a tendency to do big follow-up attacks after that but not too much to worry about as long as you roll away from the lightning you'll be able to get away from him so again he's can teleport in your face very important to look at what his hand is doing if you notice that the hammer is being swung just roll through that otherwise if it's straight out orbs are coming and you got to roll away from those and be very careful you want to do your best i know this sounds obvious but you want to do your best to make the ratigan fight as clean as possible because elden bees can be a bit of a mess but that's where we're going right now so eldon beast is a really really cool encounter quite something to look at for sure but it has a lot of extremely deadly attacks attacks the likes of which you really haven't seen before in eldon ring which is kind of nice so starting off you can just run in on the boss get a bunch of damage right away and then eventually it'll start reacting for the breath attack you can just get right behind it the breath should not hit you while you're trying to hit the boss on its tail it'll swim away and then it has a few sword swipes easy enough to avoid we'll talk about the gold ones in a moment so when the boss sticks its sword into the ground and it starts glowing gold you want to try to get near its tail this way you can avoid the shock wave you can roll through all of it not a big deal but you want to just try to get away when the boss swims away starts glowing and then flies up into the air you'll notice a ring in the air there's two different attacks that the boss can do with these rings if it's just one ring then all you got to do is run back jump over one ring and get out of the outer ring before the explosion you got to be careful though because the boss will move as you're running and start readying another attack it shares a star fall ability or star cloud ability very similar to aztel natural born of the void we may have fought earlier on in the game just get out of the cloud wait for the explosion and you'll be okay so the boss can begin to slam its sword in the ground while it's blowing gold then it has a carving ability and then it can shoot a rune arc at you luckily i have enough health to just eat it however you may not so when you notice the boss's sword glowing gold as you're close to it just get ready to roll out of the way of big slashes and then somewhat of a slam afterwards so when the boss's sword begins to glow at a distance it's gonna start shooting rune arcs at you these need to be avoided you can roll through them getting the timing down especially from a great distance is a little tricky but i'll show you a clean one a little later on in the fight throughout the fight the boss can swim away and when it comes out of the water and just starts glowing you want to untarget the boss and then run in any one direction you're going to avoid the starfall attack that comes i noticed that if you are targeting the boss while running from that the camera will kind of auto correct you and then you're going to end up running into the stars but if you just untarget and then pick a direction you should be completely fine and avoid all of it you do want to watch out for any big body slams those are telegraphed by the sword more or less but if you're close to the boss it'll just look like a body slam it can rake the sword in a backswing followed up by a regular swing and then a bit of a slam down those are easy enough to avoid no special magic is coming from those when you notice that the boss's left hand is glowing purple and it's close to you it's gonna slam it down and then stars are gonna explode after it you can just roll straight into the boss maybe adjust to the left a little bit this way you can get away from the starfall explosion maybe throw in a roll to just ensure you don't take damage from that but not too difficult to avoid if you ever deal enough damage to the boss and it gets staggered for aeropost their apostle location is its chest i thought it might be the head that's why you saw me running around like a chicken with my head cut off for a second i just didn't know where to go but the location is its chest okay so occasionally when the boss gets low on hp it'll fly up into the air and do a different ring attack you can see that this is now the elden ring up in the air and what this is is now there are several rings for you to jump over i miss time this so i am going to just bite it but it's three rings followed by a big explosion if the elden ring shows up however if you are on the ground and you notice that the boss is gonna send out a runarc beam at you what you want to do is just stay on the ground and the runark will go right over you so it's not the end of the world if you get caught in that ring explosion as long as you don't die just wait to see what the boss's next attack is and you may be able to just stay on the ground and completely avoid it giving you some time to recover once you do end up getting up because chances are the boss will just sort of fly away for a second that purple star cloud does have a big travel distance so just be careful here is the four dodges for the runarch beams not too difficult once you kind of recognize what the boss is doing the boss really only ever does that when you're far enough away and you do not want to roll once the sword is swiped you want to roll when the beam gets close to you the beam does have a pretty decent travel time so just look at it make sure you understand what's coming and then you'll be able to roll through it right here i did not disconnect from the boss with my camera so it auto corrected while i was running and i got hit by a bunch of those stars but whenever you see the boss start flying away it's better to just disconnect your camera from it untarget it this way you can run in one direction without getting auto-corrected and you'll be able to avoid the stars there is another attack that the boss does it's the elden stars incantation i actually have it on my bar here that ability i hate to say it i don't exactly know how to avoid other than just running away from it the stars don't deal too much damage however if you get hit by the bigger explosion it can stagger you my advice for that ability however is to just keep an eye on the boss make sure you're avoiding the boss's abilities as eldon stars is out eventually elden stars will go away and then you can continue with the fight like normal but just watch out for the boss's abilities because for the most part eldon stars is just there to pepper you with tiny bits of damage distract you from the boss and then ultimately the boss will probably just cut you down with a sword so if elton stars is out just try to deal with it keep an eye on the boss and you'll be okay but that's it that's radigan and the elden beast that's the final boss of the game if you have multiple endings unlocked you can quit the game and back up your save and then you know go see the endings if you like for the different trophies i will say if you have the frenzied flame ending unlocked you are kind of locked into that ending unless you go beat melania then you'll get an item that allows you to undo that ending and that unlocks the rest of it for ronnie's ending there will be a summon sign on the floor and for the rest of them you just want to touch the statue in the middle and you'll literally be able to select an ending very similar to security and that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for elden ring there

Title: How to Kill Mohg Without Fighting Him - Patched as of v1.12 - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: Pul9pyN2iyY
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring it feels so good to say that after two years since my last Elden Ring guide feels so good to make another one this time I'm going to show you how to easily kill Mo Lord of blood this does require that you have access to Moog which I feel like is obvious but we need access to the dynasty mum midpoint side of Grace at the very least I did this by doing white mask var's quest line that does require online play so it'll require a subscription to ps+ or Xbox Live on Steam you can just do this without because obviously PC players don't pay for um online services um but if you don't have access to those Services then you will need to do this by going through the consecrated snowfields I'll leave a link to my original Mo guide of how to reach him um but white mask VAR is quest line can be done in leria of the Lakes it goes from the first step in limb grave into learia of the lakes and then you finish all there does require some online play though okay so very important in order to get this glitch to work Moog has to be spawned in order to do that if this is your very first time visiting him you need to enter his boss Arena once the cut scene finishes or you can skip the cut scene you need to exit the game by going to the start menu and then exiting the game and then coming back in will put you outside of the boss fog that means that he is spawned so he will always be spawned there however if you die on any attempts of this glitch where if you leave for whatever reason you will always need to take the elevator back up to his boss fog every single time because he will not spawn until you take that elevator up very very important that you respawn the boss otherwise he will not die using this glitch okay so once the boss is spawned take the elevator back down and then we are going to do a series of tricky jumps now I'm going to unintentionally successfully fall and survive but I am going to show you the more intended method so the general idea is you want to drop onto this platform here walk into the wall and then as you begin to climb it you want to jump do not run just walk up the wall and then jump and then you will land on a platform below it now I'm going to cut the footage here and show the intended path we're going to start at the start again from that side of Grace We're going to drop onto this little platform here and then we're going to walk and then jump forward so as soon as we begin to climb the invisible wall keep walking and jump forward then we're going to do a running jump off of that ledge but you don't want to jump until you begin to climb another invisible wall so just run forward and then as you begin to climb an invisible wall that's when you want to take a leaping jump and from here we're going to go back to the original footage where we're going to kill Moog so cutting back to that follow this path until you get to a bloody rock face jump down you'll be able to summon torrrent at this point do a running double jump with torrrent you will automatically get dismounted when once you cross the Gap and then we're going to climb this next Rock here recommend applauding any player messages you find along the way give people some love okay go ahead and climb that wall simply just by running and jumping up invisible walls um it's it's pretty easy it just looks a little funky on the other side of that wall you can summon torrent once again and then this is the area where we perform the glitch so in between these two rocks is a crass and we're going to fall down this crass now it's very very important that when you jump into the void you double jump so use any gold pickled foul foot to increase the amount of runes you're going to get equip your gold Scarab Talisman if you have it and they begin the glitch so like I said we need to double jump into the crass and the reason for that is because when you double jump on torrent you're able to swing your sword repeatedly so it's very important that you double jump into this void and then just keep swinging your sword if you don't swing your sword you will hit the death plane and die but for for some reason double jumping allows you to repeatedly swing your sword and you just keep skipping the death Plaines I'm not doing anything special here other than repeatedly hitting R1 just kind of mashing it and that's it you just do this for a while and then as the world unloads all of the enemies will fall through the world to their death and you will gain the runes so because I use a gold pickled foul foot and because I have the gold Scarab this whole process including killing Moog is is going to net me over 1 million runes now what I will say is this isn't exactly a viable Farm method the more reliable Farm method in mwin Dynasty is to just shoot the uh big bloody Crow from across the Gap near the very first side of Grace uh the one near the blood pools and everything um just take a a compound bow shoot that Crow and then it'll run and fall to its death you could just repeat that process over and over and it's much faster than farming the 200k runes you're going to get out of this process but eventually Moog dies and then we get another 655k and then all you have to do to get out of this is just warp but you do want to be kind of quick because you're not going to be swinging your sword while in the map menu so if you want to be super quick just bring up the map press Triangle Square and x and that will bring you immediately to Round Table hold that's a shortcut um otherwise you can just uh select a nearby warp point and go there now I do want to show you that after we warp I'm going to take the elevator back up to moog's boss room and he's not going to be there and that's because he he's dead and the side of Grace will be available to you and if you're like me you're trying to grind up a fresh character for the DLC maybe your character like mine is on New Game Plus you don't want to go through a from software uh DLC on new game plus maybe in 2016 you went through the bloodborne DLC on new game plus 4 your first time and you don't want to to repeat that experience so you want a fresh character that's what I did and you do need to kill Moog in order to access the DLC that is confirmed and that's it that's how you kill Moog with a reliable cheese strategy again this was recorded on May 30th 2024 on the current patch of Elden ring on PlayStation 5 I do want to give a huge shout out to another YouTuber named tyrannicon I actually found uh a video of his that showed this method um but in that video it mentioned that you had to like constantly spawn the Boss by going into the boss fog and quitting out but I tested it a little bit further and it's really just spawning The Boss by getting up there so I wanted to kind of update the guide myself but that's it all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for Elden ring especially Shadow the a tree DLC subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new videos go live if you need help with

Title: Divine Beast Dancing Lion - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: 4l7ZFLtK7gc
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat Divine Beast dancing lion for this battle you want to make sure that your armor has a decent amount of Elemental resistance on it try to get it as high as possible without going into heavy roll for myself I use the heavy yatana plus 25 with the sacred blade Ash of War I don't really focus on this holy damage buff it's more so just have like a range attack whenever possible and that bonus damage is nice but you don't have to really focus on it too much I do have the Solitude armor set from the black jail Knight boss early on in the DLC most important Talisman in this setup is probably the Pearl Drake Talisman plus two greatly reduces non-physical uh damage incoming so really really important there also have the great jars Arsenal which greatly increases equip load have the dragon Crest Great Shield Talisman and the Earth trees favor plus one if you have the plus two Earth trees favor go with that this character is not currently in the Ashen capital so I didn't have it for my flask I have the opaline hard tier once again this is greatly reducing incoming Elemental damage and then the Crimson Crystal tier just to uh give me some health back for my blessings I do have five scatter Tre blessings and five revered Spirit Ash blessings this boss early on in the DLC is kind of like your marget the Fel Omen you're going to run into it you're going to get your butt kicked and then you need to go Adventure somewhere else level up your character a bit increase your blessings and then come back that's what I did and I had a much easier time with it okay so phase one of this boss fight lasts until the boss reaches about 75% HP and for the most part it's just introducing you to its physical attacks as well as this sort of stone breath it doesn't petrify you or anything but it just looks like it would when the boss stands up on its hind legs and begins spinning around I recommend just doing your best to stay close to the boss the camera is the biggest biggest boss in this room it's invisible but it will drive you insane so just keep that in mind and whenever the boss is spinning around try to stay as close to it as possible this way you go underneath the breath sometimes that won't work out try to rotate to the left as the boss is spinning and sort of follow it alternatively you could try to time your roll to the right while the boss is spinning and then you might have a better time okay so moving right into phase two here the boss basically has the same exact attacks but they all have some sort of Elemental bonus to them if you will so when the boss has all these lightning attacks the breath stays on the ground a decent amount longer I have found just because electricity tends to scatter pretty much every single attack will call down a lightning storm when that happens just move out of the way it is very important that you learn how to time your dods for the lightning bolt throwing attacks because that will land and then immediately start a thunderstorm around you again with this uh sort of spinning breath attack you want to be very very careful and try to to stay as close to the boss as possible the boss will eventually transition to another element this time I got wind which was kind of nice I really hate the frost attacks I find them very difficult to dodge but I got wind here this sort of back flip kick there when the boss is sort of just floating in the air watch out for it it's almost always going to be that attack and you can roll in any direction to get out of it either forward or backward don't recommend rolling to the side there just cuz the boss sort of arcs uh as he goes so just either roll forward or backward through that flip kick and you'll be okay the tornado there you can roll through it it's just very difficult at time I don't recommend running otherwise it will catch up to you almost every single time it caught up to me I was only able to outrun it a single time in all of my like hour and a half of attempts so just keep that in mind do your best to just roll through it the frost phase might be the second most annoying for me just because the boss is constantly building frostbite and you really don't want that to uh sort of attach to you and you you want that to build up all the way I do not recommend bringing boluses into this fight they're basically just a waste of time against Frost and when you're eating those you're just going to open yourself up to more damage so just try your best to either avoid the boss during that Frost phase or roll through the attacks I almost recommend avoiding it more just to kind of get him to cycle into some other element for the lightning attacks there you you can actually see where the lightning is going to strike on the ground so if you have managed to roll away from an attack then what I recommend doing is just paying very close attention to the ground and then seeing where the lightning is going to strike after the boss Chucks a lightning bolt at you it will always illuminate that entire section of the ground and that area is all going to be lightning in a second so just move very far away from that area cuz lightning does have Splash damage in this fight so it's very very important that you get as far away from that section as possible again we're going to get a tornado here managed to block it with a plus 25 brass Shield I only took half stamina damage so luckily uh I was able to just sort of back up and eat that hit with my shield and I ended up being okay the boss does have a couple of grab attacks that I want to mention you won't see them here I didn't get hooked up by them but when the boss sort of rears onto its hind legs and then Chomps it's going to do a grab attack it can either Chomp twice I've also seen it Chomp up to four times you want to wait for those Chomps Don't Panic roll but just wait for those Chomps and then once the ball starts moving towards you roll either to the left or to the right do not roll backwards I don't even recommend rolling forwards roll to the left or the right and then you should avoid the grab if the boss grabs you you'll get a red debuff around you what's going to happen then is if you drink from your flask you're going to heal the boss I have never been able to get it to drop off the debuff I've I've waited forever and it it just never goes away I'm not exactly sure if there's a way to negate that debuff otherwise you may just have to eat the heal and you'll end up healing yourself too but the boss does heal when you have that red debuff so avoiding those grab attacks is of the utmost importance otherwise the fight will drag on you'll end up wasting flasks and you're not going to have a good time and that's basically the fight so again what I recommend doing is when you first Reach This boss if you've just sort of been following the guidance of Grace you really haven't been adventuring anywhere I really do recommend just leaving and coming back to this boss after you get your blessings up to at least five those blessings are super super important they buff all of your stats as you play the game and they are exclusive to the DLC area so even if you're a bit lower level find those blessings keep leveling them up and then come back and you'll have a much easier time treat this boss like marget it's sort of in your way and it's encouraging you to go do other things and that's it all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for Elden ring shadow of the a tree please subscribe

Title: Blackgaol Knight - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: Aprhe7eOsBc
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat the boss the black jail Knight the black jail Knight is not terribly difficult however he is really annoying because he has super high Poise he also has this perfumer crossbow that he loves to just rapid fire spread at you so if you're not careful you can get caught by that and almost more or less get one shot by it so be very very careful when you see that crossbow come out for this fight I'm really not spamming my r1s and that's because this boss has super high Poise at this point in the DLC I was still going with my gargoyle great sword plus 25 which I beat the game with if you remember two years ago this is basically the exact same build I was using um the boss tends to roll away after just a couple of hits I realize that as I'm saying that I'm hitting him four times in a row there that's kind of rare this boss just like all of the mausoleum bosses so far in the DLC at least that I haven't countered can and will heal with the flask he only gets one flask so it's sort of like um sort of like a PVE ever jail fight with an MPC they can heal once same thing applies here the boss does have a weapon art where it does that sort of uh vertical slice but it does Arc so I recommend rolling to the left whenever you're seeing that start to come out the boss just like you will try to use jumping r2s you can knock him out of the air however he will not go flat on the ground when you do that instead he'll actually land on his feet and he really doesn't have to wait very long before going after you again be very careful with that so you can see there the boss healed he only gets one flask and just like all of the other NPC fights in the game the boss will attempt to use his flask again so you can sort of exploit that and there just go in on him once you see that flas come out he'll try to do it again at about 25 to 30% HP what I will say is that these bosses can bleed if you're using a bleed build they look like ghosts but they do count as human so if you have a bleed build just keep going you should be able to get him to bleed I was not able to actually break his Poise however it seems like he has a super super high Poise rating even with the plus 25 gargo Greatsword I was not able to break his Poise or get a uh stamina break on him if you're able to backstab him go for it he just moves so quickly that I wasn't even attempting it especially because his sword just deal so much damage the other thing that I want to mention is if you see the boss two-handed sword be very very careful and try to keep your distance from him when he's two-handing it seems that he has much higher Poise and can just eat your hits while swinging his own sword just be careful with that and whenever you see him load that crossbow and hold it Forward just walk in a straight line either left or right and those perfumer bolts will fan out and just miss you when you defeat the boss you'll get the Great Sword of solitude as well as a Solitude set which is a really solid armor set this early on in the DLC has good Elemental resistance which you'll need later on show you the location here on the map this is right at the start of the DLC this is the Western nameless Mausoleum haven't even picked up a map fragment yet and I only have one side of gray so you really cannot miss this boss highly recommend doing the mazums as you find them they drop really good armor and usually weapons as well and it's not too hard of a boss fight I will also show you my stats and my build so I am using um a gargo great sword plus 25 like I said and a plus 25 brass Shield did this at level 172 literally came right into the DLC after finishing building this character earlier this week so you can see my stats here it's mostly a strength build um I'll probably start putting points into decks uh just because I found that throughout the DLC faster weapons seem to be better U but I did have a lord sworns lord sworns straight swword plus 25 uh in my build as well didn't really use that instead suck to the gargoyle great swword as well as the brass Shield plus 25 do have the Brier armor set the Brier armor set continues to be very strong in the DLC rolling into your enemies while wearing the Brier set tends to break their animations and sort of stun them for a second which is really really really helpful and then my talisman's it's it's pretty basic her Tre favor Dragon great Shield Talisman nothing too special there and I didn't even use the uh the flask of Wonders physic but that's it all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for

Title: Furnace Golem (Gravesite Plain) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: 3Kj9Anbv2Tc
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to take down the furnace Golem that you will find just outside of the scorched ruin in the gravite plane early on in the game furnace Golems are not necessarily super difficult to fight mechanically they can and will deal a ton of damage to you however so you do have to respect them but these are kind of like the new her tree Avatar bosses uh in the realm of shadow in so much that you're going to be running into them a bunch and every time you defeat one at least so far in my experience you will get a tier for your flask so you're going to have to deal with these things a lot that said this video will show you sort of all their attacks and how to successfully eat every single one of them but the general idea when fighting them is that you want to watch out for their legs and when their legs start to erupt in fire they're going to Stomp and when that Stomp comes out you want to double jump on torrent to avoid it the fire will still be on the floor however it doesn't linger in terms of dealing damage the fire will actually stop dealing damage basically once it hits the ground so as long as you double jump after a Stomp and double jump basically as soon as that fire hits the ground you're going to avoid it no problem so I've actually also managed to avoid it just by single jumping without torrent it is kind of difficult to time that the double jump really really does help the general strategy for these guys is to just keep whacking their legs with whatever weapon you have magic should also do the trick just fine but just keep whacking their legs and you will notice that you're going to start to hear the stun sound however they will not get stunned right away instead what's going to happen is you need to stun them several times so it's sort of like the trolls uh from Storm Hill very early on in the base game kind of the same idea where you can sort of temporarily stun them um but you won't actually get that full critical until you stun them a couple times so for at least this furnace Golem I had to stun it three times before it actually fell and then once it falls you want to look out for one of the masks on its side and then that mask will begin to glow and then you can get a critical on the mask and that's going to deal like 30,000 damage um I think on this one it deals about 13 but it's about like 40% of their health so that's really what you're looking for just keep whacking its legs and eventually it will fall down then you get a critical on one of the masks and then you just got to do that once maybe two more times if your damage happens to be super low you saw there that the furnace Golem can actually jump in the air like it's Jordan uh for that it's the same exact way to avoid the uh the damage just jump and then double jump once it uh the fire begins to spread the boss does have a grab attack uh that in my experience will one shot you so you don't want to get hooked up by it that's easier said than done but basically the way you just avoid having to even deal with it is try to stay behind the boss as you whack its legs and then it really shouldn't even go to use that attack but if you notice that it's sort of like lurching forward and its legs aren't glowing and you can sort of see its hands begin to flail a bit just run behind the boss and stay behind it and you should be fine the animation of getting grabbed by this thing is actually kind of funny so it's worth eating it once just to see it but as you can see here the boss goes down and then I am going to unsuccessfully uh get the repost here because I didn't really know what I was looking for at this point but basically the boss is down and then you have plenty plenty of time to get that repost or that critical it just stays down for so long it's even long than a dragon in my experience so once it goes down feel free to do some extra damage around the mask and then try to get the critical on the mask as you saw there it de like 30,000 damage and we're just recycling this fight again whenever you're fighting these things I recommend just stay beneath its legs I hadn't kind of figured that out until about the end of this fight and throughout the beginning of this video you saw me jump into all the the lava attacks those are really easily avoided as long as you stay near its legs and that's it I'll let the the rest of the video play out but that's the general strategy for these things just double jump when the fire starts to spread on the ground and you should be okay I have noticed that uh torrent tends to take a lot more damage in the realm of Shadow than it did in the lands between I'm not really sure what's up with that I'm not sure if they're going to patch that or if that's intended but be very careful watch torrent health bar feel free to feed him raisins if you can but just keep on going and eventually it'll go down but that's it all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I do my best to help you out if you're looking for

Title: Rellana, Twin Moon Knight - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: HU1FJiLZrV0
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to take down Rana twin Moon Knight for this boss my build was as follows I used a lord sworns blood straight swword at plus 25 and most importantly I used the oneeyed shield the reason for this is because I wanted a shield that had high physical fire and Magic resistance I do have a really high equip load at 118.7 that's thanks to 42 endurance as well as the great jars Arsenal so just keep boosting that sort of Defense magic fire and physical in my flask I have an opaline hard tier and a crimson Crystal tier the opalene uh hard tier increases all damage negation so if you find yourself getting sliced and diced by the fire and Magic feel free to use talismans that will help negate that the Pearl Drake Talisman is really good for that as well okay getting into the fight in Phase One you will only have to deal with either physical or magic attacks the magic attacks are fairly obvious when they coming the swords are not permanently Enchanted at this point with the boss's physical attacks they are really long it kind of reminds me of dcer the Boreal Valley in Dark Souls 3 because these combos just keep going and they have a huge delay on them sometimes so what I recommend doing is don't try to go in and punish every opening instead what I recommend doing is wait for her to actually finish her combos you see these big two-handed swings chances are she's going to either do the same move again just backwards and sort of end the combo that way or as you're about to see here in a second she can actually end it with a forward stab and even that's not the end because after a one-handed forward stab she can actually move that into a two-handed forward stab so it can get really really tricky so just wait for her combos to actually end and then you'll be okay in phase one for phase two I've had her open with this Firestorm ability several times for Karan great sword she can do a second hit almost every single time so you want to roll forward through the vertical slice and then be prepared to roll again for the horizontal slice that one is a little bit delayed I noticed that whenever I was really close to her sometimes I would eat that second uh horizontal hit so try to give yourself a little bit of distance this way you're not just like rolling into the hilt of that caran Greatsword okay so for this phase whenever she does some sort of stab with a fire sword if you see a glow after the stab that means that any fire trail that she's left behind is going to explode you'll notice here that I kind of backed off of her the reason for that is because I wanted to restore my stamina this Shield is really heavy and so my rolls take quite a lot of stamina and it doesn't replenish super fast so I'm trying to be very very conscious of my stamina management and do my best to give myself an opportunity to just refill and then sort of go in whenever I have an opportunity while the boss is doing combos pay close attention to the magic blade in her right hand the reason I mentioned that is because you do not want to get caught by her vertical slice that can come out very very quickly for that double moon sorcery you just want to jump three times jump once the first ball drops jump once the second ball drops and then pay close attention to when the boss herself drops and then you want to jump again and jump over those AOE explosions I'm sure you probably could roll through it but I was never able to Jumping just is pretty foolproof okay so you saw there that vertical slice that quick slice that I was talking about that caught me dealt a ton of damage even with this uh negation I have going on because of my opaline hard tier still really really tricky that multi-hit combo with the blade beams that are coming out of her right hand magic sword I recommend just rolling left every single time for that if you try to roll forward or backward chances are the hor zontal slash that third one will cut you and it deals an absolute ton of damage so I recommend just either rolling left or right through all those and once you pick a direction either left or right only use that direction of roll don't try to like go the other way cuz you do have that little timing buffer where you're going to walk again and then roll so it can mess up your timing so just pick one direction and rolling it either left or right and then after a while of dealing with this she will go down it's a really really hard boss and you have to be very conscious of your damage negation either through Talisman or your flask or your Shield or all three but that's it all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a

Title: Golden Hippopotamus - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: TmAzGxx7YXg
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the a tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat the golden hippopotamus boss at the shadow keep main gate this is the first boss of Shadow keep and it's very annoying I'm using the gargoyle's heavy gr sword plus 25 for this fight as well as a plus 25 brass Shield the rest of the build kind of doesn't matter and the reason that I say that is because I really disliked this fight I found it very difficult just to manage because the C CER was constantly flipping out and this boss moves a lot it's constantly shuffling around it's constantly kind of jumping around and the camera just does not know what to do with it especially when you're in a tight corner so for this fight I recommend not using lock on as much as possible feel free to use it if you're comfortable with it but I found that it actually made it worse the only times that I really used lock on was to try to reenter the camera on the boss other than that I kind of went without it tried maybe 20 times using lock on and it just wasn't really helping me at all and then I detached and managed to kill it in just a couple attempts so I will warn you this boss fight for me is pretty sloppy but I'll do my best to help you out cuz that's what I'm here for the boss has a lot of delayed physical attacks and then when you get it to about 60% HP it will start uh using Crucible magic or Crucible uh incantations to improve those attacks but they're basically the same exact thing just with a bit more damage and something extend ended on them that grab is incredibly hard to dodge because you can't actually see the boss's bottom jaw sometimes because it's going under the floor making it really difficult to judge when the grab is actually going to happen if you are ever close to the boss either on the left or the right side pay very close attention to its mouth whenever it sort of opens its mouth and Roars a bit a physical attack is coming when you see it push its head into the ground that means that a delayed swing attack is coming so don't panic roll right away wait for the head to actually move toward you so like I said when you get the boss down to about 60 70% HP it will begin using Crucible magic so be on the lookout for these porcupine needles that are really quite devastating when the boss slams down it will rain porcupine needles and then you have to either pick a direction and run or if you're stuck in a corner like I was do your best to roll at a steady pace and then you should be able to dodge most of it luckily one needle is not going to one shot you one needle doesn't do an absolute ton of damage maybe 10 50% HP at 60 Vigor but getting hit with a bunch of them in a row will cause you some problems so like I said in phase two a lot of the boss's attacks are extended it will start hitting twice instead of once in some circumstances so don't uh assume that everything is the same except for the porcupine needles pay very close attention to the boss's mouth again when it's opening in its mouth chances are it's going to attack just like that it has a snap it can follow up its attacks with uh Crucible magic so you got to always pay attention to when it's glowing whenever it's glowing it can do one or three attacks this slam uh it will actually slam down and then rotate you want to roll during the rotation to avoid the needles the boss can also jump up in the air and very similar to the fall star beasts it can dive and then it'll begin to Arc to the left so when the boss is diving you want to roll to the right very late and then you'll be able to dodge everything so the boss has a double slam there that is pretty difficult to judge especially if you are directly underneath the boss but that's the boss fight so for the three Crucible attacks when it leaps up and stays hanging in the air it's going to dive towards you and begin arcing to the left so you want to roll to the right for its big slam as soon as it hits the ground the needles will shoot up and then rain down so you want to pick a direction and run in it or do your best to roll at a stey timing and you should be able to dodge them and then for the other slam it will slam down really quick and then rotate and the needles will shoot directly towards you you can roll through them this is a really difficult fight made more difficult by the camera so again I don't recommend using lock on for me that was easier to just keep things rotating and it kept me out of trouble in sit situations where a locked camera would just kind of force me to move into a corner and ultimately die so I do hope this guide has been helpful to you not a huge fan of this boss I never felt in control but I did want to give some tips as best I could that's it all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll my best help you out if you're looking for more guides for Elden ring shadow of

Title: Messmer the Impaler - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: 61jl9Djbpvk
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to take down Mesmer the Impaler this boss is super difficult and I used a very specific setup for him I used the Lord sworns blood straight sword at plus 25 the boss is barely wearing any armor very susceptible to bleed as well as most importantly the fingerprint Stone Shield at plus 25 the reason for that is because I wanted to have 100% physical damage negation as well as as high fire damage negation as I could get and the fingerprint Stone Shield is the way to go so feel free to level that up and then you also want to increase your endurance this way you can maintain medium equip load I did also use the jar Arsenal Talisman to increase my equip load even further and I still maintain medium roll okay for the fight itself the boss will always open up with this dive attack the way to time that is just stare at him when he's in the air and then wait for him to drop down and then roll wait half a second and then roll again and you'll be able to uh completely Dodge the explosion and then you'll be able to get a couple of swings on them so whenever you see the boss release an arc of fire or spin his spear in an arc he's always going to follow that up with a lunge attack he does have this Fireball that goes above him delays and then goes after you you should have seen this from all the enemies in this dungeon so that shouldn't be n to you it's just bigger for this attack here you want to roll forward with when the boss flies toward you and then wait for him to uh lunge at you one more time with that spear lunge and then roll again and then you should be able to dodge the rest of it no problem it looks terrifying and it is terrifying but it's actually fairly easy to dodge it will give you flashbacks to water foul dance but it's not nearly as bad and of course he doesn't heal so you see here lots of arcing swings those are always followed up by lunge attacks the nice thing about this boss is that you can actually learn everything from all of his attacks and I know this sounds ridiculous but all of his attacks are actually the same he's doing the same thing over and over and over except sometimes the spear is on fire sometimes it's not even when the spear is on fire it's the same exact Dodge timing and same attack same exact attack timing the entire time he's doing the same thing over and over and over except sometimes it's on fire so he's really just doing it to freak you out for the grab really difficult to time that you want to let him move toward you for as long as he wants and then watch his hand very closely and once the hand starts moving toward you that's when you want to dodge for this big attack you want to roll once he moves towards you and then you just got to roll through the first spear attack and then roll through the slam wait half a second and then roll again so you can get through the explosion and then deal damage for the second phase base serpent Mesmer this is actually not as hard as it looks so the snakes all move with delay so you don't actually have to dodge right away instead wait for the snake to actually move toward you and then you're good to go you can also block all of these they're just physical attacks and you may just get pushed back and luckily when you get pushed back you actually get pushed into a position where the next one will likely miss so don't be afraid to just block those attacks if you have high enough endurance you should be fine whenever he uses a snake attack he will uh generally be stuck for a little while so you can kind of just go in on him after he does it but all the moves from the first phase are basically the same except now he has no armor so they're actually a little bit easier to see he just gets all these new snake attacks however the snake's hit box is also his hit box so anytime you deal damage to the snake it's dealing damage to him he is the snake more or less he does get this new physical move where he sort of spirals into you you'll notice that he crouches on the floor he tends to do it after those big arcing slashes when you see him crouching he's going to do that spin I do not recommend under any circumstances to try to hit him when he's crouching like that because the move comes out almost instantaneously so what I do recommend doing is getting some distance on him and then waiting for him to do that spin attack and then dodging it you should be able to do that as long as you have even just a tiny bit of distance otherwise it's really really hard to judge so he still has these arcing flame attacks followed by lunge attacks then a spin and then he does that spiral attack after that spin attack so that's kind of the only added piece of the combo that he has other than that everything is more or less the exact same except the explosions are bigger the fire does more damage and he does more damage and he has a snake stuff that's basically it that's the fight it's a lot scarier than it looks and once you learn how to dodge that attack where he flies overhead you're going to have a much easier go of it don't be scared of the snakes just pay attention to them wait for them to actually move toward you before dodging they kind of like to posture and jump up and then stare at you but don't roll until they actually come near you and then right after they attack start swinging as long as it's not that big five or six snake sequence just start swinging and you're going to deal a lot of damage to him because when he comes out of snake form he's actually kind of exposed for a little while and won't do anything but that's it that's mesur the Impaler I hope this has been helpful to you if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you like looking for more guides for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree please subscribe to the

Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat the dancer of Rana in the southern nameless Mausoleum along the Cerulean Coast for this boss I used a heavy UT Katana plus 25 as well as a gar gr's great swword plus 25 just to kind of show a bit of variety during the fight um but you don't really need to go too crazy with the build did this at level 176 with level five blessings for both the scatter tree blessing as well as the revered Spirit Ash blessing but this is one of those sort of like ever jail style fights so the build is a lot less important than you might think this particular mle is somewhat hidden like I said it's on the Cerulean Coast it's on an island however in order to reach that Island you want to find a cave near the Cerulean coast west side of Grace it's just along the Ridge near that side of Grace near a tree it's not a cave in a wall instead it's a cave that you fall down into so just follow that Coast near that side of Grace you'll find it no problem drop in and then take the path that leads near a crayfish and you'll pop out the other side okay for this fight um it's sort of like a pyromancer dancer kind of fight so she is light on her feet um unlike the black jail Knight she does not have high Poise so you kind of can just mess her day up she is dual wielding these blades so with that comes a spin attack for the Spin Attack though what you can actually do is just wait for her to spin once and then you'll be able to get her out of it um just by hitting her once really with any weapon it worked with both the gargoyle's great sword as well as the UI Katana was not a problem at all she will tend to spam this Spin Attack if you give her like medium distance it's this right here you can hit her out of it as soon as she swings once she's got like no Poise cuz she's barely wearing any armor the only other thing that you really got to watch out for in this fight is this attack right here it's like a pyromancy fan flame you can roll through it but you do want to be quick on your Counterattack because she can very quickly take her blades back out and then do a spin attack so as long as you roll through it just kind of spam R1 as soon as you roll through it and then you should hit her before she begins swinging and then just rinse and repeat the process it's a fairly easy fight and again unlike the black jail Knight she really has no armor so she can't really uh get a lot of poise or like really break through anything so it's going to be somewhat easier as long as you have a decent build the other thing that I want to mention is that uh most or like most NPC fights she can heal once and then she will take out that flask again at some point and attempt to heal herself usually below 50% HP she'll try that once if not twice when she does that take advantage and exploit that weakness and then just go in on her you'll be able to get another couple hits but that's basically it I'll let the rest of the fight play out this way you can see what I do but those are all the tips that I have for you all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guys for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the join button below this video you can also leave a super thanks by clicking the heart icon below this video don't forget to join my community Discord link for that is in the description below as always I'll s Johnny Cage thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye-bye [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] h

Title: Putrescent Knight - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: Lg2jdXWY1mc
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat the putrescent knight in the stone coffin Fisher I recommend bringing a fire weapon with you to this fight uh the boss cannot bleed at least that I found however it does seem to be moderately weak to fire so that bonus damage can help and any fire related Ash of War will be very helpful to you as well did this at level 183 with a level 9 scatter tree blessing and a number or level six revered Spirit Ash blessing as well like I said before this is located in the stone coffin fiser the way to gain access to that is to go to the southernmost point of the Cerulean coast and then you want to jump down this Central Ravine here and then you'll find a sight of Grace called the Fisher and as long as the seal on the Fisher is broken that will happen when you get to Shadow keep at least it did for me not 100% sure if that's the trigger but it seems to be once you reach Shadow keep that that uh entrance into the fisser should open but you can just jump down there get the side of Grace and then come back once it's open and then proceed through the dungeon and then jump off the last coffin to gain access to the boss okay so the whole strategy here is to fish out this move right here when the boss is holding its sickle above its head with both hands you want to try to get close and then it's going to slam down twice you want to dodge forward both times and then punish after the second slam you can usually get in two good sword swings I do not recommend going for a third unless you're using a very quick weapon which I wasn't necessarily using when that was super fast so just hit twice because it will then do a one-handed swing almost every single time when the boss Dismounts that is another really tricky part of the fight however it is fairly easy to dodge when the boss does jump off its mount the mount will then come back and charge after you you want to just wait for this to happen Dodge forward and then Dodge forward basically immediately again to dodge the boss itself the horse will come back a second time do the same exact thing Dodge forward then Dodge forward again and then you can go in on the boss as it remounts and actually get a jumping R2 and another R1 at the very least maybe a second one if you are really quick and that is more or less the entire fight we are constantly trying to fish out that overhead slam and then this is uh when the boss Dismounts you can usually get at least one hit but you can see here I dodge forward once the horse comes Dodge forward again and then Dodge forward a second time uh once the boss starts moving towards me and then attack when the boss is mounting for phase two this happens when the boss hits about 60 to 70% HP it will put down this Frost fire all over the ground what I recommend doing is you can roll through it but you have to roll very late for the third uh wave of fire what I recommend doing there is actually blocking and then rolling if you're not using a shield you can roll through it your timing just has to be absolutely perfect there's really no room for error on that one so if you are using a shield just hold L1 to block and then as soon as you feel your controller vibrate or as soon as you see the block register press forward and Dodge to roll through the rest and you should be fine in pH two the boss's Mount gets a roar that can Dismount you it actually does have this in phase one but it's not nearly as strong so you want to just watch out for that the boss can at random throw more Frost fire on the ground there is one set of Frost fire where the ring will actually come inward what I recommend doing there is rolling backward once you see it get close to the boss you should be able to roll backward through it I was able to do it one time but not successfully in this fight but on a few failed attempts I was able to do it but just roll backwards for that ring of fire and you should be okay I don't think jumping would work uh in that scenario only because the Flames reach so high so you see here I kind of failed that first Roll But as soon as my shield vibrated on the third uh set of fire I managed to dodge through it and I took very very little damage which is really the name of the game for this fight it's just whittling this boss's HP down the boss is so mobile and unfortunately you cannot summon torrent which frankly is a little surprising considering as part of Shadow the Earth Tre they now allow you to summon torren for Elden beast but on another similar fight you can't I don't know what the deal is with that um but yeah just keep that in mind the boss is really mobile you're going to be spending a lot of time not necessarily chasing it like you would Elden beast but you're just going to more or less be waiting for very specific opportunities I would imagine if you're magic user you're going to have a much faster fight than I am only because there's so few opportunities to punish here whereas with magic you should be able to get uh some good spells off at range and then also have some spells waiting for him uh such as you know the fan lengths type spells so we're more or less just rinsing and repeating at this point I really don't have any other tips for you so I'll let the fight play out uh from this point on the move that we're really looking for the entire time is a two-handed overhead slam you want to dodge both of those attacks and then punish after the second one get a couple of hits in and then just back away or just sort of stay in its face and wait for another opportunity when the boss is using its one-handed swings it does have one where it will swing from your right its left it will swing on a huge delay that move if you manage to mess up the first Dodge you will more than likely mess up the the second Dodge as well and take huge chunks of damage so it's really important that when you are close to the boss you try to give yourself a little bit of distance this way the camera doesn't freak out whenever the boss turns around and that allows you to see its left hand uh much better than you would if you were just standing really close for this sort of fire Fountain what I was attempting to do here is I was attempting to uh get in front of the horse and just sort of get get in its direct line of vision I was hoping that that would reveal some sort of pattern uh to that third set of fire to see if I could perfect Dodge it but that opportunity really never presented itself even though I was trying to align myself I just figured maybe there was something there but it doesn't seem like it so you may just have to be really really really tight on your timing to get a perfect Dodge but that's about it I'll let the rest of the video play out here and then uh you can see how it ends all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more more guides for bloodborne I mean Elden ring please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new videos go live if you're

Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat the Ancient Dragon man in the dragon's pit in the graveside plane for this fight I used a gargoyle's great swword plus 25 I do have a brass Shield but I really never use it um and then really whatever armor you want to use as long as it has a decent physical block rating you're pretty much set I do recommend uh if you have the build for it using a great sword or a great axxe or just a big weapon in general the reason for that is because this boss really doesn't have a high Poise rating and so as you see here pretty much every single swing of my great swword is stunning The Boss the boss can still deal a lot of damage and he does have a couple of moves that have armor on them meaning that uh even if you were to hit him his swing is still coming and will deal damage to you but with a great weapon you can basically just bully the boss I do want to always recommend that you stay above half Health the reason for that is because if you get hit by his sword once nine times out of 10 you're going to get hit by it a second time his combos are ranging anywhere between three and four hits but that sword is deceptively long and so even though you might feel like you're out of range all it takes is the pointy end of that thing to deal a quarter of your life on a lunge attack it really doesn't take much for him to deal damage to you uh but again using a great weapon you can kind of just bully him and he's not really going to be able to do much to you this attack right here uh when he starts floating in the air get ready for him to drop forward and then you just roll behind him and usually get a backstab if not at least a couple hits on him he also has another dragon breath attack where he launches a fireball similar to the worm mini boss that you may have fought in this dungeon if you explor it enough basically the same exact thing it just leaves lava on the ground it's this right here uh you you want to try to get behind him however if you do unfortunately eat the hit like I did there you want to very quickly get out of the area because it will leave lava on the ground the Third special attack that the boss has is a weapon art or an ash of war that you will get at the end where you basically leap up into the air and then do a dragon grease slash that is quite deadly it'll chunk you for about 70% of your HP so that's why staying healthy throughout this entire fight is really really recommended uh but it's fairly easy to dodge just wait for him to begin moving while floating and then as soon as he gets any sort of forward momentum just roll and you'll be fine but that's it don't forget to unlock the door at the end don't take the teleporter out because there is more past this dungeon all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new videos go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the join join button below this video don't forget to join the community Discord the link for that is in the description below as always I'll be Johnny Cage thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye-bye

this using a heavy uuk Katana at plus 25 a plus 25 brass Shield as well as the Drake Knight set the most important talismans in my setup be the dragon Crest Great Shield Talisman as well as the Pearl Drake Talisman plus two and then in my wondrous physic flask I have the opalene hard tier which increases all damage negation as well as the Crimson Crystal tier which incre uh gives me half of my life bar back did this at 185 with a level 10 scatter tree blessing and a level six Spirit Ash blessing um in order to find this boss all the way at the top of the jagged Peak you want to follow this road from the start and then cross the bridge turn towards the southeast and then there is a hill that you can follow if you go on the lower level you'll find that Forge but on the upper level you'll find the dragon's pit that's a cave and I'll trace this road again so just go from the start Northwest cross the bridge and then go to the southeast further south and then you'll find the dragon's pit cave when you defeat the boss of that cave there is a door in the back you want to open it and then you will reach the jagged Peak and then it's a fairly linear path up the peak using jet streams with torrent crossing a few Bridges but eventually you will find this Arena this boss is incredibly tough took me 4 hours to do this with without summoning Egon there does not appear to be any uh big benefit to summoning Egon in terms of like storyline completion or anything I believe it gives you the same result whether or not you summon him that said I did make a couple of attempts with summoning him and he is quite helpful so if you're not interested in soloing this then summon him his summon sign is right in front of the boss fog as you cross it so his summon sign is within the arena and you can actually summon him at any time all right so my general strategy for this fight is to stay near the boss's tail and that's for two reasons one it tends to make his AI kind of stall and he will just kind of walk in circles uh for a little while this is this will happen a lot less in phase two but in phase one he will kind of just let you do it the other reason for that is because very similar to pidia saxs he has a missing Limb and it's this left leg here that missing limb is quite large and it just has a really big HT box so you can actually just get really big swings on it and you don't have to be super accurate you'll notice throughout Phase 1 I am really hardly ever using lock on I typically do not use lockon in Dragon fights and that's because especially in the case of bail The Dread they fly around a lot it causes the camera to freak out and their most vulnerable positions are not in line with the camera the camera is always going to hook up to its face which is helpful to resen yourself but I really really really recommend not locking on in Phase One the boss can do that big leap that Dodge timing is very difficult you want to wait until he's in the air he will stall in the air for a hot second and then he will drop you really only have a few frames to react to the drop so it's just something that you unfortunately have to get used to I was never able to really react to it I just kind of memorized the timing but that is a really really important move to dodge you can block it but even at a plus 25 Shield and like a 40 or 50 endurance rating you're going to get completely stunned while blocking so it's really really important to learn that timing luckily the boss doesn't do it too often at least I found in my 4 hours of attempts it really didn't happen all that often in phase one but by the time I was getting close to killing this boss phase one wasn't lasting very long so he has a breath attack that breath attack is both fire and lightning and weirdly the lightning can Arc and there's really no clean method to dodging at least that I could find what I will typically do with that forward- facing breath is I will run to the left or just roll to the left and then I will typically be able to dodge it like nine times out of 10 so we have the boss down to about 50% this is when the phase is going to transition I am using CR blade although this is barely going to do anything um while the boss is transitioning he will spawn Fireballs as he flies around and you'll notice that I am locking on while the boss is doing this in Phase 2 while the boss is in the air highly highly recommend locking on because when he's up in the air you don't have to control the camera and then you're able to better time and position yourself for dodging so when he's in the air lock on otherwise don't bother typically whenever the boss has some sort of physical hit combo he's going to end that combo by looking down and breathing straight down this breath actually doesn't last as long as you think it might however the start up on it like that intro flame damage is very strong and you have to get out of there it is not something that you can really roll through so once you see the boss sort of get in that hunched over position and begin breathing you have to get out you have to get out even before he starts breathing this is really tricky though because like I said the general strategy that I'm recommending to you is to attack his tail and his broken leg when you're doing that you can't exactly see uh what the boss is doing and so you have to just kind of get used to the timing only go in for a few attacks and then sort of turn the camera around rotate it a little bit and then see what he's doing if he's about to start breathing then you want to move that ability right there that is really easily Telegraph that charge the way you uh can tell that that's happening the telegraph is he will sort of hunch on one leg face very straight and then go and you can either roll backward or forward uh to dodge that I actually recommend rolling backward if you can time it because that will put you in a bit of a better position to catch up with him the followup to that attack is a uh backwards tail swipe so he'll actually like step backwards and then swing around really fast you can dodge that in phase two I do not recommend following that up with more attacks instead just let him do it Dodge and then wait just get close to him and wait I do not recommend sort of trying for follow-ups in the same ways that you would in Phase One while in phase two cuz he's a lot faster in phase two in phase two he has a lot of these big major explosion attacks whenever you see the boss sort of sprout these white ghostly wings that means he's going to go up in the air or he could do some big explosion attack so just keep that in mind whenever you see those wings Sprout lock onto him and get ready for him to move or do some massive massive damage the big earthquake ability that can be jumped which is really nice you don't have to try to uh Dodge roll it you do have to time the jump however it's not too too bad so I am up against a wall here which I really do not recommend there's that backwards tail swipe that I was talking about I don't recommend getting near walls you can't always avoid it and I'm certainly going to be doing it in this fight however you want to try your best to stay in the middle of this Arena and give yourself as much room to work with the reason for that is because the boss can at times uh hunker down and prepare these big AOE explosions and if you're up against a wall you're going to have really really really difficult time getting out in time to dodge the damage okay so these lightning bolt attacks you don't have to run you can actually just walk as long as you manage to dodge the first one while walking away you'll Dodge the rest it's kind of similar to Elden stars and that once you kind of get moving in one direction it'll avoid void you for the most part that said uh if you manage to get hit by one of them it will knock you down you want to just Spam roll your way up and then you will avoid the rest this huge beam has a very specific Dodge timing you want to roll into the flame the first time for the second Flame the vertical slice you want to roll to the right as soon as it's about to hit you and then just keep holding right on the stick and then Dodge a second later you need to move Mo out of the way of the explosion and then roll away from it if you just roll twice if you just roll to dodge the vertical beam and then immediately roll again you're going to get lifted up in the explosion so what you want to do is you want to roll once to dodge the beam itself from coming toward you roll to the right and then just hold right on the left stick and then Dodge again so you got to kind of time that it's a little weird but it's very very reliable to do it that way all right so this is one of those big hunker down moments you see that he's near the wall so if I had been on his right side I probably would not have escaped that so again this is the beam one more time you want to roll into the first one sort of up and the left and then for the second one you want to roll walk to the right and then roll again and you'll Dodge it no problem this big slam with his uh right broken wing Talon thing when he slams that down you want to pay very close attention to the floor because there are uh geysers that will show up and you don't have to like go crazy you could literally just walk away from them but when you see that Talon about to slam down Pan the camera down and look at the floor very very closely this where you know where not to be okay so we are whittling the boss down here I am doing my best not to be greedy like I said I fought this guy for four plus hours before actually getting a kill on him that big slam attack you basically have to be ready for it as soon as you see him hunkering down you've got to run away if you're not at max distance by the time he even uh is about to explode chances are you're going to get hit you can roll through it I've done it once it is extremely difficult I never relied on that but you can dodge it if you have to just sort of wait for the dragon itself to begin to rise and sort of explode like the the floor explodes with him as he's Rising so wait for him to begin rising and then roll and you should be able to dodge it it's very very difficult though unfortunately the boss can repeat that phase transition flying around move the Fireballs that are part of that ability for me are kind of difficult to reliably Dodge what I was doing in some attempts was rolling to the right to dodge the first one and then rolling forward to dodge the second one and then just rolling to the right continuously and dodging the other ones so it's really just those first two that you really have to work on timing once you manage to dodge those two you can dodge the rest no problem they just to fall into time okay so we are again whittling the boss down here here's that big overhead slam I'm just watching the floor luckily all the explosions were behind me so I was able to get some good damage on the tail the interesting thing about the tail is that you can actually walk through a giant section of it towards the tip the base of it is solid but the sort of back half of it is actually Hollow it's weird you can see my model is just walking through the tail it still takes damage it still has a valid hit box and hert box but you can actually walk through it that's really nice for the lightning storms uh what I recommend doing though is just in case you are sort of at the point where that um that Collision is no longer there versus there like if you're at that midpoint jump over the tail to escape you have plenty of time with these lightning strikes the ones that trail you you have plenty of time with them and you can just jump and walk and you'll be fine so just keep that in mind you don't have to go crazy with it but feel free to jump over the tail to give yourself better spacing when trying to dodge things and that's it that is Bale The Dread again feel free to summon Egon he is very strong he uses a great bow and can deal some serious damage it can also get Egon off of you which is quite nice as well but if you're like me you want to solo it you don't want to use magic or Ash as a war you just want to go One D with a dragon go for it everything's valid though kill them how you got to kill them you get the same result in the end but that's it all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're

Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat the ghost flame dragon in graveside plane sort of in the northern Northwestern section of graveside plane pretty early on in the game and you don't need a fancy build to take care of this boss really anything will do although if you do have a holy weapon that will do a bit of extra damage to this boss don't forget to loot the great Katana that the boss is guarding it's a new weapon type for this boss it's more or less a typical dragon fight except for the ghost flame Edition that is the tricky part here and I know that sounds kind of obvious but it is a little tricky because it comes out in a few different ways the boss has a breath attack that it will just spit out a forward breath pretty easy to avoid same thing with the aerial breath if the boss is in the air and is about to start breathing and it's far away from you like it's it's sort of like popped up in the air and then it's it's starting to curve you want to just run to the left and then you'll be able to avoid that aerial breath the forward flame just run left or right and you should be fine but the ghost slame can also come out when the boss Stomps in certain scenarios so even though I do recommend doing this fight on torrent just attack its legs like you would any other Dragon you do need to be very very mindful of the way the ghost flame is spreading underneath its legs and with the the shadow of the UR tree dragons as you saw there they can breathe back and forth they don't always just breathe in One Direction so you need to pay close attention to uh the way their head is tilted and then run in the opposite direction in order to avoid it now the boss is doing another forward breath here but as you saw before the boss can also sort of erupt in ghost flame and then that can spread underneath it so you have to be very careful and mindful of what the boss is doing at all times you really kind of can't mindlessly just attack dragons and Shadow of the a tree they all have new gimmicks so you do have to be careful but more or less it is a typical dragon fight just with those added ghost slam abilities so just watch out for when the boss is um sort of erupting around its chest you want to get pretty far away from it in order for it to sort of get through that cycle and then just go in on it again I'm using a two-handed gargoyle's great sword at plus 25 here uh no infusion no Ash of War really nothing like no special affinities and it's managing to stagger this boss several times in this fight so I don't know if I was just getting really lucky with the head shot or what but this boss seemed to like to go down a fair amount so you saw there ghost flame can come out when it Stomps that one's a little hard to judge um it seems that when the boss stretches and then Stomps forward that particular stomp is going to be the ghost flame but it didn't always happen so you again just have the camera facing the boss and you should be able to tell what's happening luckily that ghost flame sort of spreads out in a fan so you can either jump over it or just find an opening and go through but that's it I'll let the rest of the fight play out but those are all the tips I have for you on the ghost flame dragon all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I my best to help you out if you're looking for more guid for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the join button below this video you can also leave a super thanks by clicking the heart icon below this video Don't for for get to join the community Discord link for that is in the description below as always I'll be Johnny Cage thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye-bye

Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat the furnace Golem down in elac River sort of near Cerulean Coast in order to reach this furnace Golem in this area in general you want to start at the gate front side of Grace and then follow this path that I'm tracing and then you will eventually find this little poison swamp area that's how you know you're going in the right direction and then just follow that route you'll go through a Cave System it's a river that just goes Downstream follow it and you'll come out the other side and there will be a furnace Golem now the difficult thing about this furnace Golem is because it agrs from a great distance it will do this big swirling tornado of fire and then erupt in fireballs and it may seem like they're just sort of falling around the boss but they are not they are actually homing in on you a lot of the time so you have to be very careful of those what I recommend doing is just making a big big circle around the Golem and then just keep heading in One Direction don't zigzag just let the Fireballs run past you and then once they all seem to be done with their business just go in on him and then he'll never do that again at least that I saw so this furnace Golem is just like the rest you just want to attack the legs you need to stagger it three times in order for it to fall and then you get a critical hit on its mask either on its left or right side so you heard the sound there that means that it's stunned temporarily but we're not done yet we have to keep going a few more times with those stuns in order to get it to fall and then two maybe three crits depending on how quickly you're able to drop it will kill it the trick to these and I say this in every uh furnace Golem guide that I'm going to make all you got to do is when the feet sort of begin erupting in fire all you have to do is double jump once it is about to Stomp and then you'll be able to jump over the flame it does have attacks with its hands but it really rarely ever uses them and as long as you're sort of constantly moving around the boss and staying uh behind it in general you're not really going to run into the hand attacks the tricky thing with uh with this particular furnace Golem is that sometimes depending on how far away you get from this River you can end up uh sort of along the Ridge and you may end up agroing some of the lightning Rams and you really don't want to do that so you have to be very mindful to stay in the River Basin and not go up onto the grasslands cuz there are some really big lightning Rams up there and even though the furnace Golem can kill them for you you really don't want to rely on that because they roll around and deal an absolute ton of damage so just do your best to stay in this River Basin with the furnace Golem keep attacking the legs eventually it will drop and you're good to go so here's the critical I'll show you this and then I'll stop talking cuz I really don't have any other tips for you but I'll let the video play out so this is another reason why I recommended staying in the River Basin is because you saw there even though I was seemingly aligned with the mask it didn't connect the critical because it was on a bit of a slope I had to readjust so that's why you really want to stay in this River Basin and try to fight these things on flat ground around at all times when he does a big jump it's the same thing it's just fire on the ground you do want to get further away because there's a bit more of an eruption and you can actually uh run into Fireballs in the air but other than that it's just a double jump same as always all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the join button below this video you can also leave a super thanks by clicking the heart icon below this video don't forget to join the community Discord the link for that is in the description below as always I'll me Johnny Cage thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye-bye

Title: Ghostflame Dragon (Cerulean Coast) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: GXItXzp5krI
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat the ghost flame dragon along the Cerulean Coast this dragon can be found just due south of the Cerulean Coast side of Grace you really can't miss it as soon as you get to this region and it's sort of near the map still as well so you're going to run into it all right for this particular ghost flame dragon it's a bit of a nuisance fight and what I mean by that is that there are ads throughout the graveyard and while the dragon can kill those they can still sort of harass you and deal damage and stun you but the boss can also summon its own Undead enemies throughout the fight so for that reason in particular I highly highly recommend bringing a secondary weapon that has a holy infusion on it something like sacred blade and the reason for that is because if you were to kill an undead enemy that would normally resurrect um and you'd have to like kill the white ior that comes out of them if you were to instead kill that enemy with an enchanted weapon that has a holy enchant on it such a sacred blade then you won't have to do that second part you'll just deal a lot of damage to it cuz it's weak to Holy but then you will also uh just kill it outright and it will not respawn now the thing that I'll mention is that in my successful kill here that you're watching that Undead Army never spawns and I think it's because I managed to get the boss close to this cliff and it really never adjusted and sort of figured out that it was supposed to do more attacks because it was constantly trying to get away from this Cliff however in other attempts it spawned it at least once per attempt sometimes twice and in those attempts all I did was switch to that uh holy weapon and enchant it with sacred blade it didn't mean that I had to get off of torrent in order to do that um but it's just sort of like the price to pay with it I still recommend doing it and maybe just like running away from the dragon to enchant your weapon even if you run away from the dragon and the boss health bar disappears is it doesn't matter it will still maintain its Health same as if you were to get really far away from the arena or the boss were to get really far away from its spawn area and then disappear and then go respawn at the start again it will maintain that uh that same Health pool that it disappeared with so you really don't have to worry about it but make sure you have that Holy weapon um with you and then just use it whenever the Army spawns or just use it on the boss I mean the boss is Undead it's weak to Holy other than that this is the same exact fight as the ghost flame dragon in the gravide plane watch out for the Stomps the Big Stretch Stomps where it sort of plants on one foot and then stretches and Stomps the other foot forward that one will have ghost flame attached to it so when you see it sort of rearing up for that just go through the dragon's legs get around it and just move out of the way wait for it to subside it also has a ghost flame breath but dragons in Shadow of the UR tree uh tend to sort of do a sweeping breath and what I mean by that is it will start in One Direction sway to the other side and then sway back so you have to run in the direction that it's starting in in order to get around all that as you see here the dragon is kind of getting confused on these gravestones it can never fully reset and so it's never going to spawn that Army for me I don't know what I did to make it go in this direction maybe I was just fighting it facing in this direction sometimes but I got pretty lucky here I do acknowledge that uh but again that Holy weapon should be enough for you I'll let the rest of the fight play out I don't really have any other tips for you aside from bring a holy weapon and be prepared to buff it with that Holy infusion uh once the Army spawns run away if you want to do that give yourself some space get away from the dragon buff it go back in um yeah that's pretty much it all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guyses go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily you can do so by becoming a channel member by clicking the join button below this video you can also leave a super thanks by clicking the heart icon below this video don't forget to join my community Discord link for that is in the description below as always on sweet Johnny Cage thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye-bye [Music] [Music]

Video ID: LrPaPYO8M5A
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat the furnace Golem along scadu alus this furnace Golem is within a big army encampment and can be very very annoying to fight so what I recommend doing is taking care of a few specific enemies there's this guy over here to the right of the camp entrance once you approach this entryway the furnace Golem will start moving once he starts moving you want to come over here and take care of this enemy that is sleeping in the grass you definitely don't want this guy bothering you because he's quite strong the furnace Golem uh does have friendly fire so it can of course kill enemies around it for you but you don't want to rely on that with all these guys there are also a couple of great hammer knights riding around in this area you want to take care of any that may come into your way on the main road here because again you don't want to have to fight them while dealing with the furnace Golem because the furnace Golem agros from a distance since it will do this big uh Fireball eruption so when that is happening you want to try to get kind of far away from the furnace Golem and you want to try to kite it back along this Main Road and out of the camp while it's walking towards you slowly but surely you want to then do a big circle to try to get out of the way of the Fireballs that hammer Knight on the left you don't have to worry about him he's not going to bother us but there is one or two more along these roads that you want to deal with once you get the furnace Golem down the hill you can start going in on him he's right near the map still so that's another really good reference point and nobody should bother you from this point on just don't bring him back into the camp because that camp has a lot of enemies in it other than that this is a standard furnace colem fight so there's not much to really learn about it the trick with these guys or what you're really trying to do is you want to attack their legs until they fall down you need to stun them three times before they fall so on the third stun they will fall you're going to hear that slam noise like you're you're going to have like a free repost or something you're going to hear that noise three times and then they'll fall now the frustrating thing about this particular furnace Golem is that unless you kite him all the way down the hill like all the way down this Main Road you're really never going to be able to fight him on a Level Playing Field what I mean by that is that the ground is literally not leveled and so this can be really tricky with his flame attacks or his Stomps cuz as you're seeing as he's stomping he may Stomp Like It may The Stomp May land like somewhat in midair and that's because it's stopping at the highest point that the foot is connecting to and so what then happens is the flame then spawns in midair so if you are on the lower end of that stom or the lower end of that hill then what's going to happen is that you are going to get a shot of flame in your face and so you got to be very very mindful of the slopes in this game but as long as you just keep circling around him and circling around the feet and then hitting them every once in a while uh he will get stun and then he will drop and then you need to drop them twice and get two criticals and then he'll go down permanently and you'll get a couple of Crystal tiers but that's it all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment i' my best help you out if you're looking for more guys for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new videos going live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily you can do so by becoming a channel member by clicking the join button below this video you can also leave a super thanks by clicking the heart icon below this video don't forget to join my community Discord link for that is in the description below as always I'll spe Johnny Cage thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye-bye is oh [Music] [Applause]

hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat the jagged Peak Drake on the jagged Peak Foothills so in order to reach this boss first you need to get to the Dragon's pit cave dungeon and then at the end of that cave dungeon there will be a door that opens and then that leads you right in front of this boss so this path kind of starts on gravide plane so to find the dragon's pit on the map and then just go through that and come out the other side and then you'll fight this Dragon my setup is pretty basic uh use whatever weapon you like this is a more or less standard dragon fight with some lightning mixed in I don't really recommend changing your build for like lightning resistance or you know anything like that um you really don't have to worry about it you have a huge Arena to fight this guy in however as you're about to see in this fight he is going to go downhill at one point and despawn any enemy can do this in the game this often happens with Dragons cuz they fly around if this were to happen Don't Panic instead take a minute to breathe heal up reset any Buffs that you want to use and then just go back to uh this sort of lake and then he will be respawned and he will actually have the same Health pool that he left and despawned with so you don't have to panic if they despawn it's fine just reset and then keep going okay so it's a pretty standard dragon fight um the dragons in Shadow of the earth tree however their breath attacks are somewhat modified and that they can do these like sweeping breath attacks so if they ever do a forward- facing breath pay very close attention to their head because it's going to sway to one side or the other and then what you want to do is you want to match that Cadence this way you can successfully avoid the breath so if the head starts on your left then go to your left and jump over the flame otherwise if you have enough of a head start you can go the other way and avoid it that way as well so as you see here the flame is sort of swaying and we ran to the left we've successfully avoided it got behind the boss and we were okay when the boss flies up in the air and you see its mouth uh sort of starting to breathe fire and it's a a fair distance away from you is going to do a sweeping breath attack all you got to do is always go to the left and then just fly uh ride in the opposite direction that it's flying and you'll be fine just go to the left whenever you see that flame attack sometimes the boss can go straight up in the air like this and it'll either stomp or um breathe flame down on you in either of those scenarios just follow the tail and move in the direction of the tail as quickly as possible and he should be able to avoid everything uh the drop attack or the stomp attack that is really easy to get hit by um so just as soon as you see him go up just run towards the tail and he should be able to avoid him so as you see here the dragon is beginning to go downhill we have all these lightning Rams around and now we have this lightning attack that is unique to uh this particular type of dragon however after this breath attack the boss is actually going to despawn and then we're going to have to uh go back back to the start but you as you see here its health bar is just below 50% HP when we restart this fight from the other direction it's going to start with the exact same amount of health so it's nothing to worry about so if you're using any Buffs or if you want to replenish your magic or something go ahead and do that and then begin the fight again and you're fine so I'll let the rest of the fight play out here there's nothing else to really tip you on it's a standard dragon fight with some lightning mixed in if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the join button below this video you can also leave a super thanks by clicking the heart icon below this video don't forget to join my community Discord the link for that is in the description below as always I'll sweet Johnny Cage thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye-bye a

Title: Ancient Dragon Senessax - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: ApU6nB5kwW4

hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat ancient dragon senax in the jagged Peak defeating this boss gives you an ancient dragon smithing Stone as well as a somber ancient smithing Stone so it's a pretty serious reward for a decent amount of effort I did this using a gargoyle's great swword plus 25 also have a UT Katana plus 25 in there as well um the setup more or less kind of doesn't matter because this boss can deal so much damage at once that you're rating is kind of pointless I wouldn't say do it naked or anything but um you're mostly going to be running away from this boss as you do it luckily even though you're technically inside of a cave you can still summon torrent and I highly highly recommend that you use torrent for this fight in order to reach this boss in the first place you need to first get through the dragon's pit in the gravide plane area which is the intro of the game so just follow this road that I'm tracing you have the road from the start you cross the bridge then you head south and then you find the dragon's pit you go through the dragon's pit there's a door on the other side and that leads to the jagged Peak and it's a fairly linear path from there up to Peak using jet streams and crossing a few Bridges you will run into this boss as You Adventure through this area it's on a straight line okay so from the stake America I am just running straight in the frustrating thing about this boss is that its lightning attacks all spread because you're fighting it in water it's really difficult to fight this boss Anywhere But the Water this whole cave has water in it you have to be very very careful with all this boss's lightning attacks so whenever you see it rear up on its H legs it will do a slam attack and it can sometimes do two of those sometimes it'll spawn swords and then it'll slam those into the ground it effectively does the same thing except the ripple effect of the lightning is even greater than just a hand slam for the most part I'm just doing my best to stay underneath the boss and near its legs and whenever I am in front of the boss or close to the front of the boss I'm try trying to get behind it as quickly as possible as you see here I am taking two hits in getting knocked off torrent torrent really does not have much health I'm almost wondering if it's a bug in Shadow of the UR Trey just because it feels like everything knocks you off of torren so quickly in this expansion could be wrong on that but you want to try to stay on torrent as much as possible the boss can also breathe fire through its legs that uh is also something that can be very very deadly because that flame breath lasts a long time so if you get hit by it once there's a serious chance that you may get hit by it twice my gargoyles great sword has a poison infusion it's not doing a ton of damage it's only ticking for like 40 damage per tick but I fought this thing for like an hour and I was getting so tired of it that I figured you know what anything helps at this point so let's just try a poison infusion and luckily it worked um but yeah it's it's a fairly standard ancient dragon fight very similar to lancs in alt's plateau in the base game there's really not much different about it it does have these uh Gale bursts these sort of wing bursts if you manage to get out of it you can just uh just back up and then wait for the fourth one and then go in it does not deal any damage so even if you find yourself getting hit by it it's not going to deal any damage to you it's just going to knock you over so don't panic while it's happening you can actually roll through the the wing burst hits themselves you can roll through them that said though since you're on torrent you're really not going to need to worry about that but just in case you find yourself knocked off t you can dodge them if you want it can be worth dodging them if you want to try to get a hit in if you have a quick weapon you can get one hit in per roll uh but it also does allow you to stay with the boss um after it finishes and then you're able to get some more damage so here are the lightning Stakes that get slammed into the ground again because we're fighting in water everything ripples out and the fight becomes very difficult but that's basically the fight it has no phase two it just keeps doing the same thing when it flies away you do want to watch out for uh another lightning slam attack so just keep your distance and then you won't have to worry about the ripple effect while it's doing that and once it's done just go back in and repeat the process uh also don't forget about Dragon wound grease that's really strong against dragons and can help a good deal the only downside is that it doesn't last very long when you enchant your weapon with it uh and you can't enchant while on torrent but if you want to fight this boss on foot go ahead and bring Dragon wound grease as well but that's it all right I'll let the rest of the fight play out and you'll see how it goes all right if you have any questions please feel free

Title: Where to Find and How to Kill Metyr, Mother of Fingers - Full Narrated Quest & Boss Walkthrough
Video ID: ks-5weTpMqY
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to find and defeat metor mother of fingers metor is available as sort of the quote unquote reward of a pretty long quest line that spans a large part of the realm of Shadow so I'm going to start off by showing you the actual quest line that leads to her but if you're just looking for the boss guide check the description for the Tim stamp and just skip right to that but I'm going to make this guide assuming that you have no idea how to find and then guide you through it we're going to begin our adventure at the mor ruin sort of smack dab in the center of the map to get to morth ruins from the start of the game it's fairly easy so the start of the game is this side of Grace here gravide plane you're going to follow this Road North you're going to get to this fork in the road at the three path cross near uh micholas cross you're going to cross this bridge which is the elak Great Bridge and then you're going to get to the castle front side of Grace Just in front of Castle enus this technically can be skipped however that's kind of a crazy route so we're going to assume that you do Castle enus you're going to end up on the other side of the castle in scadu alus near the high road cross and then you're going to follow this Road North to the fork and then Southeast at the fork to the mor ruins our mission is to go through Mor ruins which is just this small village that was sort of exploded there's a cave to go down into and then we're going to come up the other side in Bonnie Village which is a pretty Twisted place Bonnie Village uh is important because there is an emote on a corpse right around here so I'm going to place a marker here once you grab that emote you want to follow this path across these Bridges follow this road to the North and then West and then eventually it will fork and then you want to follow it South and you will end up at the Cathedral of Manis mettier there is an MPC in the cathedral and his name is Emir Emir is the NPC that you want to do everything with he his quest Line's already done for me so he's not going to be there however I will show you like you just want to keep talking to him you just want to keep talking to him and then he will give you the items you need for the quest you do the quest you come back talk to him again he gives you the next part you go you do that you come back he gives you the final part and then you can fight the boss so I will show you the quest but he's going to be gone so it's going to be a little different but anyway that's the mission get to Cathedral of Manis met here and I'm going to show you the path now starting at Mor ruins so this is the side of Grace for Mor ruins and then we're just going to follow this road we're going to ignore everything um there are those sort of karate guys the athetics here they are pretty tough so just be careful there's one or two of them lurking around but you want to come over here and then you're going to pop off torrent and then we're going to jump down here okay come over here and then there's going to be a cave right here there's going to be dogs you can just run away from them or kill them up to you so if you need pop on a lantern or take out a torch and then we're going to come down here and then come down here be careful of these enemies we're just going to turn around and we're going to keep falling going to this balcony fall again and then there's going to be a cave just up these stairs here and then this is going to lead to a really uh deep cave with a big ladder so I'm actually just going to warp to the top of this ladder but there's a side of Grace at the top of the ladder and now our next mission is to get that emote the emote is very very important so where you pop out is going to be this well right here this is the top of the ladder and the side of Grace is right here so to get this emote we're going to go to our marker which is north Northeast right here there is a ravine that you got to jump over if you fall into the Ravine it's not the end of the world just follow it to the end and then you'll come out and then come back over here okay okay so there is this gnarled and wilted tree and then there is an emote here on this corpse and this emote is called oh mother oh mother is very important because it unlocks another area of the game okay so when you get that emote go ahead and go back into Bonnie Village cross the two Bridges follow this path there is a furnace Golem uh guarding the path um you can try to run away from it but you can also kill it using fire pots by taking a Spirits spring up to a ledge and dumping fir pots into it um but eventually you will come to the Cathedral of Manis meter within the Cathedral of Manis meter there is an NPC named Emir and Emir is the person that you need to speak to so Emir will be sitting on this Throne right here you'll see the sanctuary icon pop up that means you can't attack while here and Emir will be on this Throne if you speak to him a bunch and agree to do what he wants he will give you a a map oops go the other way he will give you a map of ruins so he gives you the Ruins map and then if we look at it it shows us the general direction or the general sort of area of our first ruin so we now need to find a ruin that looks like this and luckily I got here kind of late so I had already found all the ruins um but you want to come down here to the finger ruins of Ria now the way to reach this can be a little confusing but you want to make your way to the Cerulean Coast which is down here it's this Blue Area the Cerulean Coast is reached via the elak river so the laak river runs along gravide plane this is the laak river you want to get down here then you'll eventually find a cave which is the elac river cave and you want to keep following it and then you'll get spit out right here and then there's a furnace Golem guarding this as well actually but you can take that one down normally and then you are going to follow this path here and then you're going to get to the Cerulean Coast side of Grace and then from here it's a fairly straightforward path you just want to follow this general direction here you're going to come out here and then you are going to get to this beach this beach if you look closely there's actually a path drawn on the map this is like a sandb the the water is very shallow you can just ride in it and then eventually when you ride along that Sand Bar you're going to come up here to this side of Grace right here which is the finger ruins of Ria then from here um this is just a really long journey so I'm just going to describe it on the map like the path is literally a straight line it just takes very long but from this side of Grace you want to follow this path here this finger down uh I have this marked right here if you would like there is uh a remembrance duplication mum here it's not the jumping Turtle mums it's just a bed with a corpse on it but it does the same thing um but you want to follow from the side of Grace go down this path and then you will get to the finger ruins of Ria in the dead center there will be a bell for you to blow into using the key item that Emir gave you blow into that you'll get a Talisman come back to the cathedral speak with Emir again so just come back to the Cathedral of manism here speak with Emir again he will give you the next ruin map which is Ruins map second so now we need to find a ruin that see seems to be coming off the outshoot of like a castle or a keep or something and is on a little Peninsula by itself and that is where we need the O mother emote this path is a bit more complicated so I'm actually going to show you this path manually so we're going to go back to this fork in the road uh to the church District High Road and then if you follow this road you'll come into a castle keep and then you will end up in the church District entrance this is the backside of Shadow keep Shadow keep is a really long Legacy dungeon that actually has two Legacy dungeons in it which is really cool when you arrive here it's going to look a little bit different it's going to be flooded with water now I have it drained I'll show you where to drain it I'll just tell you like the general direction to go you don't have to drain it for the purposes of this particular quest line but you do want to because there is a remembrance boss here that you want to kill okay so I'm going to show you the path to get where we need to go and it's the same path to drain the place as well you just take a right instead of a left all right so we're going to run along these rooftops and this will all be doable with it flooded so don't worry come over here to this window and then jump over come onto this wall here actually going to turn on my lamp because it's getting a little dark jump up here there will be exploding zombies you don't really have to worry about them come over here and then there will be a forget their name Mesmer monk dude he's going to be up here I'm going to try to kill him yeah these guys are are really annoying um just because they back up and then do the the fireball attack luckily that went over me okay got him great cool he's really annoying and normally I just run past every enemy in these guides but you need to make a really precarious jump and if he's chasing you or if he's got a fireball going it can be uh you can get hit by the fireball in midair and just die so do that jump come up here and then be very careful When approaching this top section of the roof CU it is bombed out but we want to fall right here onto this rafter there will be an item on that rafter over there uh there's a couple ways to do that you can just go down here and then go up the rafter on the right and get it but you want to jump down here and if you're curious how to unlock this door over here very quickly there's an NPC who will invade you here in Bell your rat I think it's like right here around um he invades you there you kill him and then he will invade you again in the Church of the Crusade after you kill him the second time he will drop the key that opens that door and then you will find him in that room okay but for our purposes we're going to continue going through here we have another Monk guy I'm going to run past him and to drain this place you want to go through here and then follow that path however for our purposes we're going this way so we're taking a left instead of a right right and then there will be an elevator here and we're going to take this elevator all the way up and if you've been wondering hey in the specimen Storehouse there's a bunch of floors that I can't reach there seems to be items and enemies that I can't reach now you can this elevator brings us back to the specimen Storehouse it's a very big elevator it'll take a couple seconds but it brings you back to the specimen Storehouse and then you can explore the rest of the place now the specimen Storehouse does have a second boss however that is not the boss that we need to kill uh we don't actually need to kill any bosses to do this um but we come back to the specimen Storehouse and then we're going to take a left and then there's going to be a side of Grace right here so I'm going to rest at it just in case I die I'll obviously cut out the death but I'll rest here just in case great and now what we're going to do is we're going to take this big old ladder and we are going to go up there are some Treasures over here along with another one of those uh fire monk guys or Fire Knight guys so we're going to take this ladder and this is the ladder that goes through that big bookshelf you saw earlier right now we're popping out the other side of the bookshelf there's the crucified guy crucified on a rune Arc and then we keep going up this big Snake Eater ladder okay now we are basically at the rafters so I recommend sneaking up on this oh we can pop him off no problem sneak up on him do a backstab we're going to come over here we're going to go up the staircase get his runes there they are go up this staircase keep going and then there will be some items over here that you can grab don't forget about those but our actual destination is to pop out this uh wall here so we're going to keep following this wooden path and then we come to yet another side of Grace right and once here there will be an elevator waiting for us and now it's time to have some fun on the Rafters there's quite a lot of treasure up here as well as a couple of different uh ways to go however for the purposes of this Quest I'm going to show you uh the most direct route so we're going to come over here and then we're going to ignore that bat but having a bow or something is super helpful or weapon art that can deal with them come up this ladder and then yeah this guy's not going to leave us alone great he's dead cool so once up that ladder we're going to come over here we're going to cross this diagonal here and then we're going to drop onto this bat cool and then we're going to jump over here great and then you're supposed to like take that ladder down right there but you could actually just fall it's no big deal also makes us you deal with less bats but you want to come out here back outs side and then there's going to be another elevator for you this is going to bring you down to another wooden platform and then we're going to follow this path to you guessed it another elevator however for that particular elevator I'm just going to warp so this door does not open this door actually exists on the other side but it doesn't open from either side it's weird um but basically just take this elevator down and then you're going to go right in front of the shadowkey back gate side of Grace that's where it's going to spit you out I'm just skipping the load cuz it's a very very long elevator but that's the elevator right there it's a dark but that's the elevator cool so there's going to be a boss fog here this is a boss fight that I have a guide for on my channel I'll leave a link to that in the description however where you want to go is this room right here and the statue will not have moved it'll be sort of blocking that passageway but this hint on the floor says have mercy for the Spirited Away shaman and so what you want to do is you want to stand right here and then you want to use the oh mother emote that we picked up before and then you just wait a couple seconds and then the statue will move I think the idea here is that Amica who this is a statue of although her head's missing America is mesmer's Mother and so you want to use the oh mother emote there and she was from the shaman Village originally right here cool so this is the Hinterlands and there is a shaman village now what I will warn you is that there are a couple of tree Sentinels wandering here so you're going to see one of them like your first time here is basically right where my helmet's pointing but then another one is hiding around the corner at that fork in the road what I recommend doing is going to that fork in the road aggroing the first one pulling it back to this area this sort of Ridge line here you can fight it there no problem it's not like a brand new tree Sentinel sort of fight it's the same thing you've always done kill that first one and then kill the second one in the open field it's way easier that way okay so our purpose here in the hinterland is now we need to get to this finger ruin this finger ruin again it's a straight path however it is teaming with creepy crawly hands and those alien dudes so you got to be very careful while going there but it is just a straight line and then once you're there you want to ring that Bell at the finger ruins of Deo and then once you've done that you want to go back to to the Cathedral of Manis mettier and once again speak with Emir Emir will then give you a third ruin map which we'll pull up here he gives you the third Ruins map and if you look carefully this looks an awful lot like the building we're standing in so it has that sort of J shape or backwards yeah I don't know what you want to call that like it's a j- shape-ish but there's no finger ruin here right like this is the building right this is the bridge that it's talking about this is the building we are in the finger ruin is underneath this building so what you need to do is after Emir gives that to you you need to reload the area either by Saving and quitting or saving or warping back here and using the side of Grace and then you will notice that he will be missing so what you then want to do is you get a new prompt in front of the chair called examine and if you look closely the bottom of his chair looks peculiar so if we were to push in that button the chair will move off of its plinth revealing a ladder so then you want to go down this Ladder into the final finger ruin ring the bell and then you'll be transported to the boss fight and now we can finally do the boss guide the build that I recommend for this fight is really bring any weapon that you can put a fire Affinity on so I'm using the flame art UI gatana plus 25 and the reason for that is because finger creeper enemies are all very weak to fire and this is the first time in a guy that I'm telling you to bring a craftable craft fire pots giant flame fire pot whatever doesn't matter as long as it's a fire pot you don't want to use the Hefty fire pots because they take forever to throw but bring a fire pot because the boss can spawn finger creeper enemies throughout the fight and if you just Chuck a pot as soon as they spawn you'll kill all three of them right away they just get hit you deal a bunch of damage and then they burn to death so it's really really important that you bring fire pots especially if you're not a magic user like me and you just use melee that's really really important the boss can do these slam attacks kind of opening up it also has these side finger flays the boss can also crawl to you so it's really really important that you do your absolute best to stay in front of the boss in front of its sort of open wound the eye up top the fingerprint eye that can shoot laser beams it has a sweeping attack and then in phase one it will just do a single burst laser and then in phase two it can do that burst laser several times in a row okay for this hand swipe you want to roll left and then right immediately you have to roll very quickly in order to avoid that for the sort of Slam attacks the boss does it can do them all multiple times so that's why I'm not immediately reacting to everything the boss is doing so right there that could have been three slams instead of one so you just want to wait a second before you actually react to any of those slam attacks whenever the boss uh sort of jumps over you it's always going to follow up with that laser and you see here as soon as the boss rips open its wound and spawns those hands I am immediately going to my giant flame fir pot and throwing it you can really use any fire pot just don't use a hefty one because they take a long time to throw use whatever small one you got and just throw it and they should burn and die I'm not using any sort of Jar Talisman to increase my jar damage nothing just use fire they will burn away okay so this is a multi- jump that could have been a third one as well so that's why I'm always waiting to deal damage and then around 60% HP the boss will uh transition the phase but I recommend doing there I didn't examplify it very well but you want to try to get out of the explosion but also still face the boss this way you can block once the phase transitions the boss can do some really crazy thing mother will start mothering so that move right there the spin can be ran away from this is from a failed attempt although the boss oddly has the same exact amount of HP but if you are far enough away from the boss when she starts spinning you can actually just run to the left and avoid all of it it's really really difficult to do but it is possible I just wanted to show you that it was possible to dodge that spinning top move you just got to start kind of far away that orb explosion attack I'm going to show it the next time it happens but the best thing to do there is actually unhook the camera and find a clear path through the orbs the reason I say that is because the boss can't actually do anything while it's spawning orbs okay so for this attack right here what you want to do is get as close to this Whirlwind as possible and then just let the beam go over you there is a tiny tiny sliver of space to stand in between so what I recommend doing there is holding up your shield and just walking towards the Whirlwind if you get too close you will get pushed out and it doesn't really deal a lot of damage to you it's the beam that deals a ton of damage so just tanking the one hit from the force field it will actually push you into the exact spot you want to be as long as you just hold block so you'll see it again in a little while it's going to happen again I'm just going to hold Block it's going to push me out I'm just going to keep holding block and nothing's going to happen to me okay so for this attack right here the explosion does fan out so if you're at a distance you will actually see a couple of spaces on the ground where it's not as pink you can just stand there and it will explode around you and you won't take any damage but if you're too close to the boss while that move is starting just get behind the explosion and you'll be perfectly fine so again I keep trying to run left it's not happening because it just starts so close to me but that is the way to do it and then just roll very late the boss does land after it spins and then after it lands it starts moving towards you so you don't want to roll as soon as it lands you want to roll like half a second later okay so the boss jumped over us uses the beam as always and then now it's going to do a slam however it's going to jump again it can jump a third time so I was waiting to deal any sort of damage so you see here I'm just holding block I get pushed to the exact spot it wants me after the third block and then I'm literally just standing here holding block and it just keeps pushing me to the very very edge of the force field and nothing is happening to me so if you're not using a shield build or something this is going to be a little harder for you you want to try to run back but if you just hold block it pushes you exactly where you need to be to avoid all the actual damage you just have to have a uh upgraded Shield make sure it's a plus 25 and a decent amount of endurance to uh increase your stamina load and you'll be fine and that's it that's the whole fight so things just repeat after here so this is the orb move you see that I unhooked the camera now I'm trying to find a way through those orbs deal a lot of damage as you saw earlier on in the video it can be really really tough to avoid them if you're just locked onto the boss but the boss will not do anything while spawning those orbs so you are completely safe to unhook the camera and just go run away so we have two jumps followed by the third jump that's why always always wait and then the boss will now slam again that's a big one typically doesn't uh get followed up that one but can be tricky so we're here the boss just lands on us we were blocking and I'm just going to end it with a flame Spear and the boss goes down and while that is it for the boss fight that is not the end of the quest I don't want to spoil anything so what I will tell you is if you were to reapo the chair in the cathedral the quest will continue after you do some more you will get a choice with a particular NPC you can either give them an iris of Grace or an iris of occultation if you have both if you give them the iris of Grace they will turn into a spirit Ash or a puppet if you give them the iris of occultation you will get their weapon now if you turn them into a puppet there is one extra step that you can do with that puppet you can go back to the shaman Village in the Hinterlands go to the very top and then carefully jump down the cliffs there and then you will end up at the top of the tower near the cathedral and there will be another puppet in that building that you can then combine with the puppet you receive so you get an even stronger puppet which is awesome and you can actually undo this choice but just by speaking with the puppet again you can unlink it and then go back to the single but having the double is just awesome and that is it for the quest line there's some rewards in the church for you but I'll let you find

Title: Romina, Saint of the Bud - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: B28yvhJy0OM
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat Ramina saint of the bud in the ancient ruins of rahu this boss looks scarier than she is however you do want to bring some boluses to cleanse yourself of scarlet rot I know Scarlet rot probably giving you guys some PTSD flashbacks in Millennia but it's really not that bad in this fight and you have a huge Arena to get out of any Scarlet rot clouds that may pop up okay the build itself really doesn't matter that much uh she doesn't seem to be weak to much um but having a bleed weapon like a katana is helpful she is susceptible to bleed so any bonus damage is good this area is really confusing but you will eventually stumble upon this boss this is a mandatory boss in the DLC so just keep adventuring through the ruins and eventually you'll stumble upon this okay so for the fight in phase one uh there's not a ton of abilities that the boss has that can build up Scarlet rot all of them are tied to her staff whenever it glows pink like that the butterflies are a key for Phase 2 so we'll talk about that more in a little bit this move right here where the boss balls up both the Scorpion tails and the I don't know centipede tail I guess that thing is um whenever she balls up you want to wait for her to hit the ground and then get close to you while rolling for this ability right here where she flies up in the air and hovers you want to look at her stinger and on that Stinger there will be a glow or a glint there's also an audio Q for it which I found easier to react to than the visual one but as soon as that glint happens or you hear the Ping of that glint that's when you want to roll to the side and you'll Dodge that move no problem she has a pretty high recovery time from that move so you should be able to get a few hits in that move right there where she Twirls the spear it's going to be a forward hit the most difficult thing about this boss is sort of the positioning she is what the camera targets however all of this boss is a hit box so you can always deal damage no matter where you're standing or what you're touching but the camera kind of doesn't really know how to deal with this kind of Boss um so it's a little annoying but as long as you stay like right next to her while you're dealing damage you should be fine that move right there is a grab and it's a pretty deadly one whenever you see the centipede head uh start to Clack its pincers it's very very slight it's hard to see it's not like a falling star Beast where you can hear it and the pincers are huge the pincers on that centipede are not big at all but whenever you see them clack get ready for it to Lunge toward you and then it's going to grab you so just be very careful with that move same thing with the Scorpion Stinger there that move right here that is also sort of a grab that will deal a lot of damage to you so whenever you see the Tails start to like stare directly at you that's when a grab attack is coming okay for this phase transition you want to back away from the boss and all these butterflies are going to explode as they fall and deal Scarlet rot damage so use the arena to your ADV Advantage get out of there and just get away from any butterflies that you might be near if you get hit by one or two explosions it's not the end of the world just make sure at full health when that transition starts and you should be fine and have a bolus ready to cleanse yourself of it the boss more or less does the same thing in Phase 2 she does seem to get a bit more aggressive however she now has these butterfly abilities this one all you got to do is just back out and then she has another one where she will send like a string of butterflies towards you and then you just got to like run to the side to avoid that she does have a combo where she will uh swing her Spear and then when you dodge it the first time there will be like a back spin on it and that one always always Clips me so it's really important that you Dodge in One Direction once and then another Direction the second time so either right left or left right and then you should be able to avoid it uh for that second hit so you saw there that was a string of butterflies I didn't avoid that one I just sort of ran into it so the the Scarlet Rod did start building up um but whenever you see butterflies try to run to the side you got to try to find an out from that sort of vicinity but it's hard to tell which one she's doing either the large batch of butterflies that almost fills the entire Arena versus just a string of them that you can kind of run out of it's very similar to Azel in the sense that uh she's just putting a cloud in front of her and sometimes that cloud gets bigger and then it explodes also very similar to ELD and Beast from the base game as well I just thought of that so again here's the grab just avoid that that slam it's it's tough to do because it it does have such a wide hit box but as long as you roll at the last possible second uh you should be able to avoid it no problem all right for this ability here she does a couple of sweeping strikes and then slams down in the end but leaves butterflies behind so that one can be tough to avoid this is the butterfly string you see that it comes sort of in One Direction it starts with a circle around her and then she pushes it towards you and then you got to run to the side and a little further away from the boss and you're good to go you saw there that was the glint followed by the audio Q you just got to roll out of the way for that no big deal this first sweeping strike has the back swing that's the one that I'm talking about it can be really tough to dodge that second hit that's the grab right there it does come back around a second time uh in phase two so be very very careful with that the tails are more active in phase two it seems so you really have to try to your best to pay attention to them along with everything else the boss is doing easier said than done I know that's the string again now we have the big one I'm kind of running into the string here but managed to get out of it uh in the end you don't want to follow the string like I did that was kind of dumb I was not necessarily panicking at that time but I was really trying to figure that out that back swing right there I always have a really difficult time dodging that that's why I saying you want to Dodge in one direction for the first one and then a second direction for the other one you should be able to avoid it no problem if you're doing that this sweep seems to just go right over my head so you don't even have to dodge that one I think it's more meant to just catch you if you're standing at any sort of distance but if you're staying really really really close to her like I recommended in the beginning you shouldn't have too much uh difficulty dealing with it a lot of this boss's abilities actually sweeping only the spear is actually active the rest of the boss really isn't doing much so it's not like if you touch the feet of the centipede or if you touch the tail of the Stinger or of the Scorpion you're going to take damage it's really not like that as long as you stay in the Middle with this boss or in the middle of her sort of Flesh body I don't know what exactly want to classify this thing as uh you should be fine you can dodge most of the physical attacks from her Spear and that's really just the tail you got to worry about and the butterflies that's about it so I'll let the rest of the fight play out from here on out there's really not much else to say she just kind of keeps rinsing and repeating from here and she will eventually go down all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for Elden ring shadow of the earth

Title: Commander Gaius - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: 0ZRMPsq-qTk
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat Commander gas Commander gas is a horseback mounted fight however it's easier to do this without using torrent and the reason I say that is because while you're using torrent you constantly have to be jumping over the boss and running away from it and you don't really get many opportunities for heavy sustained damage on the boss so doing this on foot actually makes it easier at least in my opinion if you prefer mounted combat go for it but I really recommend doing this on foot the build itself that I'm using really doesn't matter that much I'm using a sacred Yuji Katana plus 25 that's really just for bleed I'm not trying to get any sort of real Elemental damage on the boss he's not really weak to anything at least that I can tell but any sort of bonus damage will help uh for my flask I am using an opaline hard tier and a crimson Crystal tier I never actually use it in this fight though so bring whatever works for you um but the fight itself is a fairly standard 1V one however it's more like a 2V1 because of the bore right at the start the boss will always start with this big charge move if you don't feel confident uh with your Dodge timing and he seems to be getting very close just keep blocking if you're using a shield and he should be okay it doesn't deal any extra damage as long as you have a 100% physical block rating Shield you'll be able to block that damage no problem the boss does use gravity magic later on in the fight uh so you do have to be very careful of that um but again not too too much to worry about all the gravity attacks are like really really telegraphed such as that one so you really don't have too much to worry about with the gravity magic for the majority of this fight the boss is going to be running away from you and then charging into you he also has these really really long combos he also has a donkey kick so whenever you are behind the boss or a bore kick I should say whenever you're behind the boss you want to be very careful you don't want to do more than a couple of hits really quickly otherwise that donkey kick is coming this combo is really long whenever the board digs its head into the ground it's going to flip it back up and then gas himself is going to slam his spear down so you want to be very careful but once that combo ends you can get a couple of good hits on him so you saw there I blocked the charge and I'm also doing my best to pay very close attention to my stamina and there's a mechanic in Souls games that doesn't get talked about very often but your stamina recovers more quickly when you are not holding up your Shield holding your Shield counts as an action so your stamina is going to recover very slowly so if you ever block a big hit from the boss and your stamina gets Drop Like 75% as long as the boss is somewhat far away from you just let go of your shield and just kind of stand there for a second and your stamina will recover very quickly so that's helpful for pretty much any boss but it really comes in handy with this guy because he deals so much stamina damage whenever you're blocking him all right so this is the phase two transition happens at about 60% HP the boss will run away do this big flashy swirl in the air but in reality it's not that serious you can just hard block it and he's not really going to deal that much damage to you you can roll into him and then get very close and deal some damage if you can get the timing right I was only able to do that one or two times um I don't even think I did it in this attempt successfully but he can redo that move that sort of phase transition move if you're uh if the fight goes on long enough heble to start using it as a normal ability so his uh gravity spear lunge Attack Just gets a bit flashier does a bit more extra damage nothing to be too concerned about this move right here where he sort of like flies and hovers and charges at you kind of similar to redon almost uh The Story Goes that he was trained by the same guy as redon or the same person as redon so that's why he uses similar attacks um for that move again it's not that serious he just kind of slams in front of you and then just moves on like it's it gravity magic doesn't really deal a ton of damage in this fight so as long as you have a decent block Shield I'm using the brass Shield plus 25 you should be able to deal or deal with most of the attacks just by blocking them um but again you can roll out of the way of them the timing is just a little weird because he sort of slams and then there's an explosion so the timing is really tight on it so again I'm just waiting for the boss to kind of come to me I'm really not doing much um literally just like circling around the boss he's using the field I'm really not my only advice is to try to stay away from the walls especially in Phase 2 I don't go too far down into the field I never mount in this fight but there is a chance that he can end up pushing me into a wall so if that happens I will Mount up and I will just run into the center and try to reset the fight the problem with doing that though is then he will use those big charge attacks and if you can't get off torren fast enough you're probably going to get very close to death so just stay away from the walls and you should be okay but that's it all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides

Title: Scadutree Avatar - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: cNEwYvgGGQY
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat the scatter tree Avatar this boss is very weak to fire it is a wilted flower it's very brittle so it can set on fire very easily make sure you equip whatever weapon you have with a fire affinity and you're going to have a much easier go of it the boss can stack bleed it doesn't really deal much Elemental damage but it can stack bleed very quickly using its thorn attacks so if you have uh bleed boluses be sure to bring those in case your current build is very susceptible to bleed in order to reach this boss it is a little confusing but it is technically near Shadow keep but it's on the backs side and the way to reach this is kind of nowhere close so you want to start at morth ruins and then you want to look for sort of bombed out in there you could fall down into a cave you come up near Bonnie Village and then you just follow this road it will eventually fork and then you take the top path it will bring you into shadowkeep church District so the backside of shadowkeep and then eventually you'll be able to drain that area and then through that drain there's a cave uh near a side of Grace in a cathedral and then that leads directly to this boss okay so this boss is three phases it dies and then comes back to life uh twice so it has a total of three phases that attack right there can deal a lot of damage it will swing both limbs all you got to do is roll either left for the first one or right for the second one and you should be able to dodge everything you see here I have fire Affinity on my weapon and I'm dealing massive massive damage to the boss the actual sunflower is the weak spot you can hit the trunk if you can't get yourself into a good position but you will not deal the same amount of damage so similar to ur tree avatars from the base game the boss has this Starfall attack for the third hit you want to roll twice very quickly I mess up the timing there but for the first two you just roll normal normal speed you just wait for the stars to get close then you roll but for that third and final uh set of stars you need to wait for them to get very close and then roll twice in one direction very quickly I tried to roll forward there just as an experiment it didn't work you got to roll left or right okay so we're going to kill the boss the first time here and then you will get a critical and then the boss will go away however it will respawn in a couple of seconds so take this time to heal up maybe uh rebuff your weapon with fire if you're using grease or something go with that and then just look for where the boss is respawning the boss can deal damage as soon as it spawns you got to be very careful and then it will immediately start zooming around the room using this attack right here this happens three times and then you can go run and catch up you want to be very careful with that ability it is really really easy to get uh clipped by it I don't recommend rolling uh backward during that fight otherwise just going to drag you and deal tons of damage to you okay so you can see here I was hitting the trunk you don't deal as much damage hitting the trunk but it is still an effective way to deal damage the sunflower is deceptive it sort of like is constantly puffing its leaves whenever that's happening it means that an attack is coming but it's a little hard to tell just because of the physics on it but whenever it's sort of staring at you you can almost rest assure that an attack is coming so whenever the sunflower head like moves that's when the attack is coming so this is the grab attack here I rolled backwards like a dummy I should have rolled to a side and it would have gotten a lot better for me but that is the grab attack I think what I thought was happening was the Starfall attack I was just too close to the boss and I really couldn't tell what was happening very clearly so this is the zoom attack here if you notice that the boss is somewhat like a good distance away from you and it's just staring at you and then pulls its head back that means that that attack is coming all right so we have the Starfall attack here again luckily this is just one but because I was at such a big distance uh the first star kind of fell away from the pack and I ended up getting hit by one of the last ones so again just be very careful with your timing and make sure that you are uh rolling at the last possible second so we dodg the the grab there and now we have the second of three critical attacks so the boss is going to go away one more time and then it will come back so again heal up rebuff your weapon do whatever you got to do luckily this third phase the boss moves a bit more slowly it's very like damaged so it's weak however this is where it has some of its strongest attacks so this attack right here recommend just backing up and blocking what you really should do is when the ball is spawning get as far away from it as possible this way you can actually have a chance at rolling through that star explosion we'll see it again in a moment the boss can do that attack and when it does it throughout the phase it can actually get stronger so you have to be very very careful of that attack if you notice that you're running low on stamina while that thing is charging up just let go of your Shield let your stamina replenish and then block at the last possible second so he gets that uh you know swipe attack back here is the big explosion I'm just backing up and blocking it happens three times so you got to be very very careful with it however after that third explosion the boss basically just falls down and then you can put big damage into it so if you manage to stay close and roll through it then you're probably going to get a kill at that point but otherwise just wait for the boss to uh lower its head again and you should be okay to get the kill and that's it that is the final hit and it will die after the third one and there you go that is a scatter tree Avatar all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment

Title: Midra, Lord of Frenzied Flame - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: 65KCWj6EETU
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to take down midra lord of frenzied flame in midr man this boss fight uh requires a really interesting setup you got to be really really mindful of your gear you want to have uh a decent frenzy resistance rating and the way you increase that resistance is by increasing your total focus so focus makes you resistant to frenzy it's out in one of the uh Talisman descriptions it says that so you want to wear any gear that increases your frenzy while also having a decent block rating so that's why my gear is kind of very eclectic and all over the place and does not match the fashion Souls was not taken into consideration for this fight I am using the fingerprint Shield so my equip burden is very very high I do use the uh gr Shar Arsenal Talisman to increase my total equip load but I do not have any extra weapons or bows or staves or SEALS or anything equipped it's actually very very minimal to exactly what I need for this fight which is just a sword and shield okay so when the boss starts attacking in his true form he will typically do that attack that you just saw right there which is a frenzy flame explosion you can actually roll forward through that just be careful because if you roll forward he can sometimes do it again immediately and it's very hard to tell that that's happening because of how bright everything is all of his sword swings can combo sometimes he extends combos by either doing a third hit or just doing the same combo twice his frenzy flame abilities are not that hard to dodge although the phase transition one can be very tricky so that extra thrust there the way to Telegraph that specific hit is if he leaves his hand up in the air in that sort of backhand pose if he's doing that still after he finishes that stab combo he's going to follow it up so it's a really good idea just pay very close attention to his hand and what stance that hand is in before going in on him you really don't want to do more than two possibly three attacks except for very specific circumstances this is one of those circumstances after he does those really big wave attacks he is very exposed and sometimes you can get up to five hit combos off on him if you're close enough when it ends that jump grab attack is somewhat easy to Dodge I failed it there but the real tricky part is that he can still do the follow-up attack even if he doesn't grab you so it's very very important that you pay attention to what his uh stance still is and sometimes he does the explosion sometimes he doesn't it's a proximity thing if you are close to him when he finishes the jump and does not grab you pay attention to him because he's going to thrust his hand back into the ground and then the explosion happens anyway you can roll through it it's not a big deal but you got to pay very very close attention okay so here's the jump you saw there he thrust his hand again but he can roll through it without an issue you do have to watch out for the little dagger in his uh in his left hand it doesn't really do much damage but it's really just there to kind of try to break your Poise and deal uh block damage so just pay very close attention to that hand sometimes he can uh do that attack twice so you have to be very very careful I don't actually use them in this fight uh but you may want to bring some cleansing boluses uh to reduce the frenzy flame uh buildup I'm going to wish that I had them on my bar here in a second because I'm actually going to get down to one HP my red HP bar is not even going to be visible that's how close I'm going to get so for this transition attack here all you got to do is just run behind him and then you can dodge it it's very hard to do it's very hard to tell sometimes it looks like he is actually just doing his jump grab attack and sometimes you just won't be ready for it see there one HP don't know how I survived uh but when you notice he's sort of like hanging in the air like Jesus just run behind him and then as long as you're a decent amount uh away from him you should be okay I've never been able to run away from him and get uh to a safe enough position to where I'm avoiding the damage I always have to run behind him so that's why it's a really good idea to keep him in the center of the Arena as best as you can you don't want to fight him near any walls because if he does do that attack then what can end up happening is you can't get behind him and while he will go over you chances are you're not going to be able to get away from him quick enough all right so it's really really important that you manage your health his attacks no matter what your gear is it seems I've tried a few different setups his attacks just do an absolute ton of damage so even if you're taking just a couple of hits pay very close attention to your health bar and do not be afraid to like just expend your flasks once you're below 70% % HP don't be afraid to just use them this is the only phase of the fight there's nothing more after this so you have or you should have 14 flasks just use them as you need don't be afraid to just use them even if the the back half of the flask is wasted but that's it that's midra it's a really hard fight lots of damage going out all the time but give it a few attempts hopefully with these strategies I've helped you all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for

Title: Promised Consort Radahn - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: hBQUy6e12gU
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat promised consort redon which is the final boss of the DLC for my building using a heavy UI Katana plus 25 as well as the fingerprint Stone Shield plus 25 the reason for the great Shield choice is because you take less stamina damage while blocking with the great shield and in phase two especially this boss has a ton of follow-up attacks I've also brought Micha great Rune into this fight this is only needed if you get grabbed should you get grabbed you want to find an opportunity to use the great Rune it will drop the charm off of you this way the second grab should you get caught by it will not instantly kill you so you need the great Rune in order to get rid of the charm from the grab but if you never get grabbed you're not going to have a problem and the grab is very very telegraphed so you shouldn't be getting grabbed by it too often okay starting out the fight the boss generally Dives in with this gravity dive he spins around three times and just roll on the fourth time the boss as you saw there all of his like double sword swings that come from One Direction will be delayed so it's very important that you watch his hands I say that in pretty much every Soul's boss fight guide that I have always watch his hands because there will be a delay you want to wait for the hand to begin moving toward you for this gravity pole you can roll through the pole however if he gets sucked in just block and then immediately run backwards and you'll avoid the whole gravity well that forms and you won't take any of the damage so the boss has two form forms of that cross slash where he takes both swords and sort of throws them at you if he sets it up with two individual slashes you get full opportunity for like two or three hits right here you can hit him two three times there however if he just quickly does the double slash do not punish him it's a quick slash and he recovers very very quickly so here is a double arm slash you saw that he really delayed the swings there followed it up for this gravity attack here you want to just run backwards and then just as he releases the meteors just pick another Direction and run the attack during phase two of the same kind you want to try to run to the right because the followup comes from the left and if you're running to the right you can avoid it if you're quick enough that move that you saw just there with the eruption you want to get really good at dodging that to the left and the reason you want to dodge to the left is because during phase two the ability or all the hits within that ability get followed up by beams of light and if you are dodging to the right you're constantly going to run yourself into those beams of light whereas if you dodge to the left you'll just go right around them so this is the big sweep into an overhead slam again we're going to transition into phase two here shortly so he does both swings followed by a slam another eruption and then we'll transition to phase two he generally opens phase two with this ability here where he sort of puts his arms out begins hovering with Mika when he does that you want to run away from him as quickly as possible I recommend unhooking the camera I'll do it a few more times throughout this fight uh but if you don't unhook the camera just hold back on the stick and just keep trucking and you want to get out of that cuz unfortunately there is no way to dodge it without a couple of without the use of weapon art so should be very very careful with that ability as soon as he does it uh just do your best to get out of the way however if you're not able to get out of the way face him and block with your Shield you won't take too much damage if you're blocking but you really want to do your best to just get out of the way all right so this move right here can end in two different ways it ended the worst way where he follows up with another swing so when you see him do that attack where he Twirls back around you want to do your best to wait before following up because he can slam again and you saw there that was that really long combo that results in an eruption when that happens you need to do your best to uh Dodge the eruption and you want to keep dodging everything to the left when he does that slam attack after the meteors you have to pay very very close attention to him because even though we successfully ran out of the way he can follow up in a few different ways and so you want to pay very close attention to what he does after he finally lands but it's the same sort of idea when he's chucking the meteors at you or when he's summoning the meteors run backwards and then as soon as he lets go of the meteors and they start moving after you turn left or right 90° and then just keep running I recommend trying to run to the right because his follow-up attack will come from your left and so if you're fast enough if you have a low equip load you'll be able to just run right past him but it does put you in a better position regardless of your equip load to run to the right this way you can try to dodge the followup by Rolling so you saw there there's that big Jesus attack I like to call it where he just sort of hovers you just pick a direction run out of the ring and you're fine that ability right there is really tricky we'll see it again in a little bit but it does involve a really quick double roll to get through the last two attacks so here we go with the slam again when he pulls up the light beams go up with him you want to dodge that earlier than you did in phase one you want to dodge as soon as you see his hands begin to lift you don't want to dodge once you see the light beams it's already too late if you're doing that all right so here's the big twirl again he did not follow that up with another slam but I got put in a bad position so I wasn't able to get out of it so for the meteors we're running away as soon as he releases I actually moved a little bit too early but once he releases start running to the right and then you'll be able to get out of the way all right so here we have the two attacks again into a twirl he did not follow that up but that's why I didn't follow up myself cuz I was waiting and I ended up rolling into this attack cuz I waited too long all right so we got one slam one two followed by a backslash that backslash there it's deadly however if you just roll into him or roll to the left you'll avoid it you just want to roll twice to avoid it and then you can get one follow up in there that sort of uh Mirror Image attack you just want to either block and hold left this way you kind of get pushed out of the way or if you're able to see it quicker than I could if you're able to react quicker to it you could just move to the left and he'll avoid you so there is the overhead slam all these blood flame attacks I recommend trying to get behind the blood flame because he has a lower chance of following it up right away and you'll actually get a second to breathe so whenever you see him do that blood flame stab followed by Arc slash just back up and get out of the way for his meteor jump all you want to do is just turn around and run in a single Direction and do not stop do not stop until you see the actual flames of the explosion at the end then you can turn around and get back to work you do not want to stop running otherwise you will get clipped and you will take an absolute ton of damage another way to deal with that is if you're too close to a wall from the start just run along the wall and then try to get behind the wall and you should be able to avoid most of the damage but just block as soon as he lands and even if you're too close you should be able to block most of the damage as long as you're behind that wall and he ran into the wall so here we go again he throws the meteors I tried jumping just to get out of the way I managed to avoid most of those attacks there however I ran into a pillar and it stopped me so the environment kind of betrayed me but luckily he does this big AOE move I'm able to get out of it and heal back up and wait for him to come to me now you'll know notice in this phase things are taking a really long time that's because you really don't get many opportunities to deal damage to him he's really quite aggressive in phase two here and because some of his attacks have follow-ups some of them don't you kind of only have a couple of opportunities for like really clean damage and so a bleed weapon is really really helpful here because you're constantly stacking that bleed damage and it doesn't actually go away for a very long time so even if you're only getting one hit in every couple seconds you're still building that meter up and you're actually going to see right here he dies to a bleed uh proc and that's what kills him so a bleed weapon is really really helpful in this fight but of course bring whatever you like use whatever magic weapon art summons whatever can help you summons in this fight May betray you in phase two just because of all the AOE happening all over the place it's easier to manage when he's in your face and you know where the AOE is going to happen but if he's focusing on your summon or the person you summon to help you or even the NPC onbo to help you the AOE may get a little crazy for you but if it works it works do whatever you got to do to kill them and once you do

Title: Furnace Golem (Ancient Ruins of Rauh) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: kpmJ4i1z4bs
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat the furnace Golem in the ancient ruins of rahu this furnace Golem is just like the ones that came before it at least so far if you've done this exloration in the same order that I have they do eventually change but this one's the same as always so for this one you want to just approach it very carefully because it does have a really big aggro range what I mean by that is that it will wake up basically as soon as you hit this bridge and then as soon as you start moving towards it it's going to start lobbing fire at you so you got to be very very careful as you approach it once you reach the end of the bridge turn right and then if you need to feel free to hide behind any of these pillars to sort of avoid this gigantic cone of fire but it should start using the cone of fire on the first bridge and then when you drop down to the second bridge it should be okay if you'd like you can come back here there's a little cavernous room with a bunch of animals in case you need any of their drops but for the most part you just want to head right for the Golem once the Golem ceases venting a gigantic Cyclone of fire in your general direction you want to come out of that cavernous room and then you can get to work so I am going to poorly demonstrate the general strategy here in the beginning it takes me a couple minutes to kind of like get myself situated in this area this is my first time seeing it so I really wasn't sure where I was going but you want to double jump over the Stomps and then avoid the claw attacks by staying behind the boss I accidentally got on the side of him here and so that left hand clipped me but as long as you stay behind the boss you should be fine with those claw attacks the rocks in this area tend to mess with the boss's elevation and what I mean by that is it's really easy to accidentally jump into fire because you're not technically on the same level as him when he's sort of clipping onto those rocks he's elevating himself just ever so slightly and so your double jump can end up uh just pushing you directly into the fire and when he does that big big jump attack there's going to be an eruption of fire along with the ground getting coated so it's really important that you get far away from him this way you can see where that fire is going and if you'd like if the fight feels like it's getting out of control and you don't have any stamina or you want to just sort of reset you can duck back into that cavernous room the boss should reset after a couple of seconds and then you can get back to it additionally there's another way to get here and that's actually to go through the side of Grace up the hill to the left of where I'm facing right now so to the left of these waterfalls there's another side of Grace that you can start at and it'll give you a little bit easier time to get a jump on the boss this way he doesn't do that Cyclone ability but like I said the general strategy just jump and then double jump whenever the boss does a stomp or if he uh if he does his own jump you want to try to try to get far away this way you don't also get clipped by the fire and then just keep hacking away at his legs and after the third stun he will drop and then all you got to do is look for the mask with the glowing eye and then get a critical on him and rinse and repeat two criticals will drop the boss and then you get your tears so I'll let the rest of the fight play out but that's a general strategy there's no more real tips to give good luck with it all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best help you out if you're looking for more guid for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted with new guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the join button below this video you can also leave a super thanks by clicking the heart icon below this video don't forget to join my community Discord the link for that is in the description below as always I'll be Johnny Cage thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye-bye [Music] what he [Music]

Title: Death Knight (Fog Rift Catacombs) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: d1M2JUZ-Fvs
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the UR tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat the death knight boss in the fog Rift catacombs to get to the fog Rift catacombs you want to start at the castle front side of Grace Just in front of Castle Enis and then follow this Ravine slightly to the Northwest and then just north and then you'll end up right in front of the catacombs in this foggy little Ravine area this boss fight is just a 1 V one duel with the boss that can literally heal himself almost too full at any time via his grab attack so you want to be very very careful not to get grabbed let show you what the grab attack looks like when it shows up so this particular Death Knight has dual axes and as you saw there he also has access to some lightning incantations but he is extremely susceptible to backstabs his attacks have long cool downs and you can literally just run up behind him get yourself a backstab and just rinse and repeat the process he's not particularly weak to backstabs you'll notice that it's not doing a ton of damage to him but it's so reliable that that's kind of the method that I suggest employing if you're a magic build or maybe a martial arts build that may not work for you so much but you still have to dodge the attacks just the same before you find your opening to go in on him so you can just employ the same general strategy okay so his grab attack will typically start to come out right around 60% 70% it's right there he does this explosion of lightning damage sort of gets covered and missed and then just Rees his hand then he will Zoom towards you as soon as you see him move toward you just dodge and any direction except backward and you should be safe from it so here it is again Dodge right into him and he has such a long recovery time that he can actually follow up with a backstab if you do get grabbed by that it will deal a ton of damage to you and also heal him I'm not sure if it's for the same amount but it is a lot you do not want to get grabbed by that otherwise it basically resets the fight and it is very very frust to have to redo this guy because his combos can be quite long and extend the fight even more you don't really want to do that but that's basically it just avoid the grab every other attack is very manageable he does have those lightning incantations but he didn't really seem to do it unless I had uh distance on him so if you're a magic user you may have to deal with that a bit more but they have a decent travel time so you should be okay just dodging once they come reading another spell and then going in on them with something else but that's it that's the whole fight all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the join button below this video you can also leave a super thanks by clicking the heart icon below this video don't forget to join my community Discord the link for that is in the description below as always I'll sweet Johnny Cage thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye-bye

Video ID: N6T15mD03DI
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat Black Knight G in the fog Rift Fort fog Rift Fort can be reached via scadu Altus there is a specific site of Grace it'll show you on the map in a second that is in front of a few Cliffs that you can fall down and then get into this fort this is the Fort that overlooks the Ravine that leads to the fog Rift catacombs so if you've been wondering how to reach the enemies on top of that bridge that are just chucking bombs at you this is how you reach him so you want to go to the scadu Altus west side of Grace so basically from The High Road cross just go around the uh the ridge line there and then right in front of that side of Grace you'll see some Cliffs to fall down and then you jump into the sport the boss just sort of hilariously stalks you out of the the keep I think it's so cool that these games do that and he has this really interesting incantation with a frog tongue where he tries to lick you with it I never got hit by it so I can't exactly say what happens but I'm sure you take damage so whenever you see that Crucible incantation begin to come out just go ahead and roll to the side and you should be able to dodge it this boss uses a great Shield slam so he is really susceptible to backstabs if you are a magic user you might have a bit more of a difficult time with him because he's going to keep his shield up the whole time but just equip basically any weapon and you should be able to deal with his shield slams if you are familiar with the Bell bearing knights from the base game very similar Vibes with that great Shield except he doesn't have the follow-up explosion attack when he does the shield slam so it's pretty basic you can just get in on him once he does it for this great hammer you do have to watch out because he has some of rigan's moves where he does a sort of wind up incantation slam you want to be very careful his attacks have a lot of delay on them so what you want to do is just pay very close attention to his hand as it holds the hammer and then once the hand starts moving toward you that's when you want to roll you don't want to roll before that otherwise you're going to end up rolling into whatever attack he's winding up so just always pay attention to his hand and that's a general rule of thumb for Souls games it's more important to pay attention to your opponent's hand than it is their weapon because sometimes their weapon is gigantic like in the case of this great hammer and then you're just going to end up rolling into certain attacks so always pay attention to the hand for the shield whenever he plants it down he's going to again delay the attack just like all the others and then slam it into you the major purpose of this attack is to deplete your stamina bar if you were to block that attack it's going to deal an absolute ton of stamina damage and likely break your stance unless you have a high endurance rating but that's basically it after a few hits the boss goes down and you have no more to worry about there are some items behind his building that he came out of so be sure to go to the left break some crates and you can get up on the roof and get some items but that's it all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll best help you out if you're looking for more guides for Elden ring shadow of the a tree please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested and supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the join button below this video you can also leave a super thanks by clicking the heart icon below this video don't forget to join my community Discord the link for that is in the description below as always I'll swe Johnny Cage thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye-bye

hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to take down the chief blood fiend boss in the rivermouth cave along the elac river I found this boss kind of late in my adventure I had already done a few Legacy dungeons as you can see here on my map I did quite a lot I even had bail down at this point so this guy went down pretty quickly for me but I'm still here to tell you how to do it so this boss can overwhelm you very quickly the reason I say that is because he has a tendency to actually walk into you and you're going to see him attempt it in a little bit but basically if you have any distance on the boss even just an inch he can begin this walking animation where he just sort of Stomps over you and Deals a ton of damage luckily for me he was doing a lot of these leaping attacks which you can just roll directly underneath but that's the walk animation I was talking about right there if you get hooked up by that that's like 70% of your health right there and it's really tough to recover from he does have a couple of moog's blood flame abilities such as that rake however because he's so big and if you're just sitting in front of his stomach you can literally just stand here keep wailing on him and that blood flame ability will never even touch you as long as you stay very close to him and that's it that's the fight shouldn't be too hard the cave is harder than the boss in this in this particular instance all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the join button below this video you can also leave a super thanks by clicking the heart icon below this video don't forget to join my community Discord the link for that is in the description below as always on sweet Johnny Cage thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye-bye

Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat Black Knight edad in the fort of reprimand in scadu alus the fort of reprimand can be reached in a couple of different ways I reached it from a back route however you can just get to it from the main road you just go south on the main road in Scot alus and you'll just reach it no problem as you can see here just go south on that road you go through a cave you'll find it however there is another way to get there near the pillar path cross back in graveside plane you want to hop down some Mountains go through a poison swamp follow that sort of path and then you'll find a spirit spring that is uh sort of locked by a pile of rocks pile of rocks is like right where I put that marker so should be able to find it break the rocks and you can take the spirit spring up to the fort and you actually get a hidden treasure that way as well okay for the boss fight itself it's a twin blade Black Knight it's not necessarily like a fog door sort of boss as you can see the boss just sort of appears the bosses in these for tend to all do that okay so this boss has uh Crucible Powers so you got to be very careful with that the most devastating attack is that leap right there the boss jumps up spins his twin blade and then Falls even if you are like directly underneath the boss the camera can kind of betray you so just be very very careful when the boss leaps up you do not want to roll until you actually see him start falling he's going to spin his blade in an attempt to freak you out so just don't let him freak you out and as long as you wait to roll roll before he lands or before he actually starts dropping you'll have a much easier time with it the boss is susceptible to backstabs so if you ever find him in a position where his back is exposed you can usually just run behind him and get that backstab and you'll deal quite a lot of damage to him if you have a backstab Talisman that's also really helpful as well this big combo sequence if you just back up and circle him to the right he'll just spin around you and you don't even have to worry about it you do want to have a decent shield for this fight if you're not typically a shield user his twin blade can meet out a lot of damage very very quickly so unless you're okay blocking with whatever weapon you're using then you do want to bring a shield this way you can better manage that sort of combo sequence of damage it gets a lot easier with the shield for The Crucible uh incantation that you see here basically flies up and then flies into you with the twin blade spinning you can just roll past him and he should just fly right past you very similar to what you've done for The Crucible knights in the base game you should be fine with that and then just wait for his combo sequences to end finally they're all very long then you should be able to get the final hit on him but that's it all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the join button below this video you can also leave a super thanks by clicking the heart icon below this video don't forget to join my community Discord the link for that is in the description below as always on sweet Johnny Cage thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye-bye

Title: Divine Beast Dancing Lion (Ancient Ruins of Rauh) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: 3l6LMwCrDP8
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat the Divine Beast dancer boss in the ancient ruins of R this boss is really frustrating because it can breed death blight and it can also spawn enemies or basilisks that also breed death blight so you want to bring armor that has high death blight resist lat's set from the base game is one of the best in the game to have for death blight resistance and then also bring any uh resistance Talisman that you can to further increase that resistance also craft a bunch of rejuvenating bises you're going to need them to get rid of any death white buildup because once the bar fills you die it is not a poison it is an instant death just like curse and dark souls okay to reach this boss we have to take a specific path through the ancient ruins of Ralph if you were like me and you did not have the map fragment while trying to find this place this can be very frustrating but if you did get the map fragment from the base of the ruins this will get a little bit easier but I made a mark on my map and that is our destination so from this side of Grace here on the bridge I'm going to show you the full path to the boss and the reason I'm doing this is because like I said before this whole area can be very very confusing because there's no topographical map available meaning that no matter where you are if you're inside of a building it doesn't matter like you're not going to be able to see anything so I wanted to show the entire path your first time through this area there will be a furnace Golem you can take care of that it is a normal one so just chop at its legs till it falls and then get the critical hit in the mask do it again get another critical hit and it should go down Okay so we're going to come up this hill and we're going to get to another side of Grace I didn't want to start the guide at this side of Grace just in case you hadn't even gotten here yet wanted to show the entire path so from this side of Grace we are going to now go inside the ruins and we are going to take a very specific path through these ruins let's come up this staircase watch out for this bouncing Fireball it is there to interrupt you and get you off of torrent so we're going to come through here then we're going to turn left and then we are going to go through this section here you do want to watch out for one of those martial arts aesthetic guys he is lurking in a corner so you don't want to get jumped by him but go ahead and take this elevator up and then from this elevator we're going to go outside and we're going to drop down in a very specific place I keep saying very specific because there's literally only one way to get to this place so turn the corner here and then we're going to drop down onto the roof of the structure and then we're going to follow the walkways in this direction now you don't actually need to follow this entire path but I did want to show you a hidden treasure that's here because this is kind of your only opportunity to get it while you're in this General vicinity but the elevator that we want to reach is right there if you're not interested in the Treasure just jump over to it and take it up and then resume the guide in a couple seconds but for the treasure which is a Talisman you want to come through here go through these little trap doors and then there's a chest right here and inside is the Talisman and then you just come through this trapo and then you're back at the elevator so really quick DeTour for a good treasure okay so we're going to take this elevator up and this elevator is going to bring us to the area with the boss it's also going to bring us to the area with the stone Golem Archer that was probably harassing you uh earlier on throughout your adventures in the ancient ruins don't forget to light this side of Grace this way you don't have to go through all this anymore and then you just continue on so be very careful of the stone Golem Archer it can shoot basically homing arrows if you're not careful so use the terrain to block it as best you can I'm not going to kill it in this video but you just hop up there through the back of the the cliff there and you can take care of him no problem and then you can more freely explore this area but you don't even have to kill them to face the boss although if he's harassing you during the boss fight I've never actually tried this but if he is harassing you during the boss fight try to get him to kill the boss for you sometimes that works out with these sort of uh I call them Discovery Channel type bosses where you can get the environment to kill the boss for you that's always a lot of fun okay for the boss fight itself changing back to the actual kill it is basically the same exact fight as bellat Tower settlement however we do have the addition of death blade so since this boss is outdoors we can ride torrent and because I personally always found this boss pretty annoying only because the camera gets very frustrating but also in his lightning phase it's just nuts and there's just so much going on that you can actually use torren to get away from the boss sort of line of sight him block his vision this way the lightning bolts can hit you but also just kind of like waste time and get him to uh transition the phase you want to be careful whenever you're behind him cuz he can very quickly spin around and do more attacks I'm very much looking forward to the model viewer of this to see what these guys controlling this thing look like um but they are literally doing a lion dance like from a Chinese parade which I think is really really cool okay so for the backflip you can either roll backward or forward for that recommend rolling forward this way you can get in some extra damage once he lands but be very careful because he can choose a follow-up attack very very quickly after that all right for this breath attack you want to stay very close to him and then once you see the breath coming very close to you you want to just roll to the side and then push further into him as best you can okay so now we have the basilisks and from here on out I'm just trying to do any sort of range damage that I can do to these things but you'll notice that I'm just getting on torrent and trying to get as far away from possible or as far away as possible from the boss now you can't always control this because here he is the boss is so aggressive and will always track you so you have to be very very careful somehow I didn't die there but there's also it seems to be that he doesn't spawn the same number of basilisks every time at least in my experience sometimes he spawn three sometimes he spawn four it differed based on the attempt not exactly sure what controls that but want to do your best to use the camera as a tool and lock onto him and then try to tap the stick left the right to see if there are any more bass lisks around because the last thing you want the last thing you want is to be fighting him and then a basilisk shows up and fills up the remainder of your death blight bar and you just die when the boss is about to die as well so you don't want that to happen so just do your best use the camera to find any additional basilisks kill them as they appear if you have pots or any sort of ranged weapons or magic use that to kill the basilisks you want to get rid of them as soon as humanly possible it is easier said than done but you want to get rid of them quick this way you can just focus on the boss that death blight phase is easily the most annoying thing in this fight other than that is it is the exact same as the bellat version he just has that added death blight phase so he's got four elements he's got death blight Earth or wind and then Frost and lightning everything else is the exact same aside from the death flight so when he's in this earth or wind form his back flip can shoot a tornado at you so it has a bit more range it's the same Dodge timing but you do have to be careful of that extra tornado he can summon a big tornado the way I personally choose to deal with that is to just walk into it and block it doesn't deal any damage you just take stamina damage it just counts as physical uh damage nothing to worry about I noticed that uh in this version he changes elements a lot quicker so what you may want to do if you find yourself running up against more Frost bring boluses to reduce that I'm never terribly concerned about Frost myself but it can lead to a lot of damage so if you find yourself uh constantly having to deal with this Frost phase just go ahead and bring Frost bises along with the rejuvenating bises and he should be okay oh I actually think I see what happened now I think he spawned uh basilisk and they fell off the cliff cuz I only see three now I guess that's what happen so maybe try fighting him outside he may u run into less basilisks but in any event I'm doing my best to keep the boss in view while also poorly trying to guess where the bass lisks are this way I can deal with a little bit better so we have one remaining to the right there so I'm going to get on to torrent do my best to get around to that while trying to bait the boss outside to buy me a little bit more time it's not really working the boss is very smart a lot smarter than I give him credit for so the uh the basilisks luckily followed me but the boss did not so he was able to kill them and then we're just going to defeat the boss from here on out so the breath abilities as the boss is standing on its back two legs that can be really really deadly in the frost phase because the frost seems to linger around for quite a while so what I try to do in those instances is I actually try my best to get away from the frost breath I don't actually stay with him to try to deal damage if I can help it it's a lot easier said than done because sometimes the boss just immediately follows up whatever the previous attack was with that frost breath and you can't always help it but that's basically it so I'll let the rest of the fight play out here it's the same thing just keeps rotating elements no big deal as long as you can manage the basilisks and the death blight buildup you should be okay all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree please

hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to take down the ghost flame dragon on Scot Altus this is a Discovery Channel fight and what I mean by that is that you're going to start this fight by watching the dragon kill everything else and everything else try to kill the dragon so the enemies in the area are going to do a little bit of work for you however I do not under any circumstances recommend getting too involved in that battle and the reason for that is because you can very easily aggro all the enemies onto you and the dragon is not going to deal much damage to them in one shot so you can end up dying before the fight even really starts so when you reach this area just wait a while and then the dragon will kill everything for you and then you can actually start fighting the dragon all right for this fight you see here the enemies even though it's like a whole Army of them really didn't do much to the dragon itself so that's why I recommend just waiting and not getting involved a holy weapon is highly recommended for this Dragon it is Undead so you're going to do a ton of bonus damage really no matter what weapon you have as long as you have some sort of divine incantation on it or Divine Affinity you're going to have a really good time with this boss now you are going to fight it on a slope so you're going to have to be chasing it all the time highly recommend doing this fight on torent the nice thing is that because the boss has such a wide area to fly around in whenever it lands it's going to tend to do a breath attack in your general direction and so you can actually just very quickly ride underneath it and get an absolute ton of damage off now if the boss isn't too interested in chasing you which luckily this one wasn't for me sometimes I run into dragons that never want to leave me alone but because this one really wasn't that interested in chasing me I was able to jump off torrent really quickly and then rebuff my weapon with the Divine and then go right back in on I'm dealing a ton of damage you can see that I'm dealing over a th000 damage per hit with this Weapon It's a Uchi Katana plus 25 with the sacred blade enchantment or Ash of War sorry so deal a ton of damage to this thing and it goes down really quickly I have had ghost flame dragons in this game summon small armies of Undead enemies to help them out luckily that did not happen this time but I have seen it in the past especially with the one on the Cerulean Coast seemed to happen every single time except the one time where actually killed it so I'm not sure if this dragon can do that but if it does that Divine weapon is going to come in handy even more because if you kill Undead enemies with Divine weapons they don't get that white ier that comes out of them that you have to then hit for a second time to actually kill them if you kill an undead enemy with a Divine weapon you're fine or a sacred weapon you're fine but that's it all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guid for Elden ring shadow of the a tree please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the join button below this video you can also leave a super thanks by clicking the heart icon below this video don't forget to join my community Discord the link for that is in the description below as always on sweet Johnny Cage thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye-bye

Title: Ralva the Great Red Bear (Scadu Altus) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]

Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat rala the great red bear in scat alus this is a bit of a world boss you get to fight it in a big field so it's not like the Rune bear fight from the base game where you're stuck in this tiny cave and you can't really move around you can even do this fight on torrent if you wish although I don't really recommend that like I said this is a bit of a rune bear fight however RVA now has bear incantations which apparently in the lore are seen as a little bit of a joke which I find kind of interesting but you'll be able to find this boss where I've marked on the map uh in scadu alus in this little Lake area and then you can just get to work so very similar to the Rune bear fight you have to watch out for a few abilities most notably is when the boss just sort of stares at you for a second it will then charge dead ahead and knock you on your butt even if you're blocking it can deal a ton of stamina damage aside from that there are a few incantations and Roars that you have to look out for most notably is that one there that results in an eruption or an earthquake effect for that particular ability what I recommend doing is just getting behind the boss as it is beginning to rip up the ground and then you can either jump or roll to avoid the earthquake the other ability is very similar to grank um in the base game where it could use the beastclaw incantation and just sort of rake the ground and then throw stones at you you that one's fairly easy to avoid you can just roll through it you do want to pay very close attention though because the uh it's not an instantaneous toss there is a bit of a delay from when the bear actually rakes its hand through the ground and then the Rocks come flying at you there is a bit of a delay there so just pay very close attention to its hand and once the hand sort of comes out of the ground that's when you want to roll other than that this is basically a bear fight so I don't really have any other tips uh there is a roar that the boss can do right there uh that really just blows you back it will deal damage if you're not blocking but it doesn't really seem to empower the boss in any significant way um maybe it'll deal a little bit more damage I never really got hit by anything you know as it was roaring or shortly after that so I didn't really notice a buff but it could be buffing the boss if you're not careful that's it all right I'll let the rest of the fight play out here there's really not much more to say if you defeat the boss you will get a pelt which is a pretty cool headpiece and it does increase the potency of bare incantations should you choose to use them but that's it all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily you can do so by becoming a channel member by clicking the join button below this video you can also leave a super thanks by clicking the heart icon below this video don't forget to join my community Discord the link for that is in the description below as always I'll Johnny Cage thank thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye-bye is

Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat the furnace Golem in scadu alus just outside of Bonnie Village this is a bit of a strange area it's technically scadu alus but it's nowhere near where you get the Scot alus map fragment so wanted to classify it as both in order to reach this area what you first need to do is you need to reach morth ruins which is just outside of Castle ensus not far to the east at all Mor ruins is a bit of a bombed out Village there's going to be a hole for you to fall down in morth Ruins follow that hole go through the linear cave there's only one path to go follow that cave you'll come outside the other end at Bonnie Village through a well in the village and then from there just head in this general direction from Bonny Village to the whipping Hut cross the bridge again and then you'll find the furnace Golem along this path this particular furnace Golem has to be defeated using fir pots and most notably you want to bring in Hefty fire pots any variation of Hefty fire pot will do could be a hefty furnace pot doesn't matter Hefty pots are needed though so make sure you have a few if you run out while fighting this thing then what you need to do is leave the area craft more and come back its health will stay uh whatever you dropped it to as long as you don't teleport out or die its Health pool will stay now you want to come up onto this Cliff but when you do so you want to be very careful because of two reasons one you need to kind of wait for the boss to like come near you and that's not always going to happen very quickly so you will need to deal with the Fireballs that it unloads on you to you know Dodge these just keep running away you can try to get behind this little Ridge there you won't take any of the blowb but you'll still take some damage but just be careful about it and then eventually the boss will begin to approach you more closely to the cliff however you still need to be careful because the boss can actually jump and swipe at you as you're about to see here so I'm somehow only going to get a little bit of damage from that but I did get knocked back so just be very careful when you see the boss begin to like Crouch or whatever that means that the jump is coming but as long as you lob Hefty furnace pots into this thing three or four should do the trick you'll deal about 50,000 damage and it goes down very quickly it's just managing those fire attacks and getting away from it and making sure you have a decent amount of Hefty pots on your person again you can't craft while in combat so if you run out you're going to need to run away for a while until you fully disengage craft more and come back and then defeat it but that's it all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the join button below this video you can also leave a super thanks by clicking the heart icon below this video don't forget to join my community Discord the link for that is in the description below as always I'm sweet Johnny Cage thank you so much for watching and I'll see you see you next time bye-bye

hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to challenge and defeat dry Leaf Dane dry Leaf Dane can be found in Mor ruins however you need to get the May the best win emote from The High Road cross s side of Grace just outside of Castle Enis once you get that follow the road north then Southeast to Mor ruins and DNE will be just in front of that side of Grace So in front of the high road cross side of Grace you'll find the monks missive alongside the May the best win emote with the May the best win emote in tow you want to go to the mor ruin side of Grace and then you'll find DNE standing in front of michelos cross you then want to stand in front of him and use the May the best win emote to challenge him to a duel just like the note says he will never speak to you he does not speak he is a silent monk but as long as you do this emote in front of him he will then challenge you to a duel and you'll just fight him in the area that you find him however there's no more enemies around and it's a bit of like an Ever jail fight okay so dry Leaf Dane has some of the best martial arts abilities in the entire game and he can be very very challenging this sort of 1-in punch ability here does a ton of stagger damage so if you're blocking chances are you're just going to get completely stance broken however if it does hit you and starts dealing damage to you you're going to take a lot of damage so whenever he breaks your stance he will try to grab you or do that sort of repost attack as you see there that 1in punch just took half of my endurance or half my St stamina and I have a really high endurance rating on this character he is really really tricky whenever he jumps up in the air he can kick once and then kick again on the way down that also deals a lot of damage and a lot of posture damage you got to be very very careful with that and whenever he starts a combo he will try to end it with that 1-in punch so you got to be very careful and try your best to only hit him once or twice and then get out of the way because you do not want to get hit with that 1-in punch luckily his armor rating is really low it's light armor so he's very susceptible to bleed so bringing a katana or some sort of bleed weapon is highly recommended but after you defeat him that's it you'll get your rewards from his corpse be sure to reload the area for more rewards right in front of the side of Grace all right that's it if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the join button below this video you can also leave a super thanks by clicking the heart icon below this video don't forget to join my community Discord the link for that is in the description below as always I'm Johnny Cage thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye-bye

hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat the tibia Mariner within Charro's Hidden Grave Cho's Hidden Grave is a somewhat hidden area although it is very prominent on the map it's this big red area just above the Cerulean Coast the way to reach this area is to find the dragon's pit cave dungeon which is in gravite plane just above the scorched ruins you want to go through that that cave and then once you defeat the boss of that cave which is the ancient dragon man just go straight as you leave the cave past the jagged Peak Drake and then you'll follow this road straight on and then you'll gain access to the Zone it's just past the big dead Dragon corpse okay so this Tibby Mariner is more or less the same Tibby Mariner fight from the base game however instead of an army of Undead soldiers this one can summon a Revenant and you'll notice that I have a seal in my left hand and the heal incantation equipped you do not need a high Faith rating to use heal however healing does massive damage to Revenant in the base game one heal will completely stun them for this one I needed two heal casts I do not have a high Faith rating uh so you may be able to get it stunned if you have a higher Faith rating but no matter what just wait for them to spawn hold the heal cast and then once they are sort of vulnerable let it go you'll deal half their health just cast it again really quick and you're good to go quick heal is another incantation that you can use there uh I don't recommend wasting a greater heal on them just because the uh the FP cost is kind of high and chances are it's not going to one-hot them so you're going to need to cast two sort of heals anyway after you kill the Revenant the tippy Marin goes down really quickly I just wanted to make this guide to show you how to better deal with revenants and this strategy works in the base game and is incredibly helpful for that terrible Alleyway with an lale brace of the Halo tree that is just teaming with Revenant all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted with new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the join button below this video you can also leave a super thanks by clicking the heart icon below this video don't forget to join my community Discord the link for that is in the description below as always I'll s Johnny Cage thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye-bye I

Video ID: gOb5k5J51K0
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat the death right bird in charo's Hidden Grave Charro's Hidden Grave is a somewhat hidden area on the map however on the map itself it is very prominent it's the Red Cliff area just above the Cerulean Coast so if you were like me and you hit the Cerulean Coast pretty early in your playthrough you've been wondering how to get up here the way to do it is to go through the dragon's pit cave back in gravite plane go through that and then and as you exit that cave through the back you'll be at the dragon's pit Terminus and then just follow the road past the jagged Peak Drake boss and then you will end up in charo's Hidden Grave so it's somewhat hidden to get into but once you're in you're free to explore it and there's a lot there okay for this particular fight I recommend bringing a sacred weapon with you the reason for that is because that does a lot of damage to the boss any sort of Undead enemy is weak to Sacred the annoying thing about this fight is is that there are a few death Birds within this area these sort of gargoyle enemies and you're going to have to deal with them first so luckily the boss does have Friendly Fire especially with its uh Roar that move right there before the grab that Roar will deal damage to the other death birds in the area however they've got to be pretty close to the boss what I recommend doing when you first get in here is try to stay near the walls of the entryway this way you can try to snipe out some of the Lesser death Birds birds or the Gargoyles and get them to come to you this way you don't have to deal with them during the fight this is a lot easier said than done because the boss spawns almost immediately when you approach the area so it can be really hard to get him to not uh start summoning everything around him and AGG gring everything around him but as you saw there he does have friendly fire so on the off chance that you're able to get something in front of him you can use that to your advantage once you're really ready to start fighting the boss you want to buff your weapon with sacred uh sacred blade is really really strong this works in the base game as well on anything that uh can do death blight generally or any sort of Undead enemy will be very weak to Sacred the boss's weak point is its skull you can't really do too much that unless you're more of a magic user or if you have some sort of Ash of war that will let you uh get damage onto the head but as you saw there my last hit did like 500 extra damage just cuz it hit the head other than the enemies in the area this is your bog standard uh death right Bird fight there there's nothing new to this that said these fights can be really hard cuz this boss deals a ton of damage and seems to for some reason ignore armor although I'm not sure that's even true it just does so much damage after the explosion you just saw there you got to be very careful because as you can see on the ground it leaves behind a lot of Frost fire that Frost fire can deal huge amounts of ticking damage so you got to be very very careful whenever you see that on the ground you do not want to stand in that uh whenever possible you want to try to get out of it as quickly as you can it's a lot easier said than done sometimes but that's kind of the idea it will leave that behind with almost every sort of empowered attack that it does it leaves behind a little bit you got to be very very careful with that explosion right there even if the boss stabs the ground next to you and it seems like it's going to go off in your face you can roll and Dodge it it's just really really strict timing if you don't feel like you're going to be able to dodge it face the center of that explosion and block you don't want the damage hitting you in the back otherwise that's a critical and you're probably going to die from it so either get that Dodge timing down or just face the center of the explosion and block and you should be safe but that's it all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily you can do so by becoming a channel member by clicking the join button below this video you can also leave a super thanks by clicking the heart icon below this video don't forget to join my community Discord the link for that is in the description below as always I'll speak Johnny Cage thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye-bye [Music]

Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat the furnace Golem in Charro's Hidden Grave this particular furnace Golem is located near a cliff that has a spirit spring in front of it and that Spirit spring is very important because the way to defeat this is actually by chucking Hefty fire pots into the furnace itself not by hacking away at its legs and hopes that it's going to fall down the legs are reinforced I don't believe that'll work if it does I'd be surprised just because the spirit spring is here and there's actually a note on a decommissioned furnace Golem back in Scot alus outside of Shadow keep that says to use fir pots on them so that's how I need to do this it was that note uh if you haven't found that already it's near a bunch of furnace vages which are used to craft uh certain Hefty pots so at the start here we're just going to run past the furnace Golem you want to be very careful though because this one does erupt with fireballs and those do chase you so what you want to try to do is get them to Chase you and then go up the spirit spring and they should just all Collide into the cliff however the boss is going to continue erupting at this point so what I recommend doing is coming over to this large gravestone and then letting the remaining Fireballs that are chasing you from the next explosion collide with the trees and this gravestone and it'll keep you safe now you want to come into this fight with probably like five or six Hefty pots crafted if you do not have have that amount of Hefty pots available to you what you're going to end up needing to do is running like expending your pots using them and then running really far away disengaging from combat which is tough to do with these things because they can see you from so far away but you want to disengage from combat and then begin crafting even more now you'll notice that I am Hawking these Hefty fir pots at the Golem but the initial ones really weren't doing much damage and the reason for that is because they weren't actually going into the furnace you need to be very very mindful of where the pots are going and do your best to aim them so they actually hit the inside of the Furnace if they hit the outside walls or anything on the uh exterior or even the hands that are sort of hovering over the furnace itself then you're going to run into a problem where you're not dealing enough damage you have to use Hefty fire pots for this you can use the normal size pots but that's going to take you forever so I ran out I had to run away disengage from combat and then begin crafting again and as you can see here I've got five more we're going to take it down really quick so the hardest part of this whole fight is aiming those Hefty fire pots but that is the way to go and once you Chuck in five or six of them it should go down and you'll get your Crystal tier INF furnace vage but that's it all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for Elden ring shadow of the UR tree please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the join button below this video you can also leave a super thanks by clicking the heart icon below this video don't forget to join my community Discord the link for that is in the description below as always I'll beet Johnny Cage thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye-bye

hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat the lamenter boss within the Lor's jail Lor's jail can be found in charo's Hidden Grave which is that red area just above the Siran coast and Below gravite plane the way to reach that as always is to go through the dragon's pit cave in gravite plane and then just follow the path out of that cave straight and then you'll find a giant dead Dragon alongside a church of dragon communion or Goblet of dragon comedian I should say and then right in front of that you get into Charles's Hidden Grave and then from there just follow the ridg line to the Northwest and you will find the Lor's jail the lament boss is one of the most creative bosses in the DLC being 100% honest with you I'm not exactly sure if the way that I chose to kill this is necessarily consistent however it seemed to work every time I tried it so I hope this is helpful to you when the lamenter uses the lamenting V Lantern it will whale and then the boss will disappear when he does this I recommend putting your back to one of the gates and then facing the center of the arena and then the boss will tend to spawn pretty close to you now for some reason when I killed that first one they all died and then I was able to just focus on the boss I'm not really sure why it was that one that died right away it maybe having to do with attacking it from the back and never actually letting it see me before I killed it that could be why again I'm not 100% sure but after realizing that that worked I did the exact same thing and it worked again but this time it just died without me even touching it not really sure why that happened because now the rest of them didn't die I had to go chasing them this is somewhat normal for the fight I tried this like five or six times before figuring out this particular method but basically the more enemies that you leave alive for longer when the boss does this lamenting whale any of the ones that are Left Alive will debuff you and sort of curse you and when you become fully cursed which is when I believe you have six heads rotating around your head you will die immediately so it's really important that you try to kill the Clones as quickly as possible but for some reason starting with my back to one of the gates and then facing into the arena seem to work best now if you find the boss you can just go after him and try to kill him how however dealing damage to him does not kill any of the Clones so you still have to be very very careful when dealing with them but for some reason they all died right there as I hit the ground so not 100% certain on what actually caused that but the actual strategy of putting your back to a gate and then facing the center of the Arena seemed to put me in the best position to deal with them as quickly as possible so that's it all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the join button below this video you can also leave a super thanks by clicking the heart icon below this video don't forget to join the community Discord the link for that is in the description below as always on sweet Johnny Cage thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye-bye

Title: Tree Sentinel Duo (Hinterland) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: s0zwS0HZvJI
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to take down the Double Tree Sentinels in the Hinterlands which is technically still scadu alus or scadu view but it's a pretty separate area and requires the mother emote to be used in front of the America statue at the backside of Shadow keep just in front of the commander gas boss so here are my stats the build really doesn't matter that much these are standard tree Sentinel fights just like in the base game there's nothing new to them however you do want to separate the two this way you're only fighting one at a time the way to do that is to approach this intersection and then that will cause the first Sentinel with the Sentry torch and the Lance to come at you you do not have to worry about the second tree Sentinel as long as you fight this one in this area he will never aggro and you won't have to worry about it so that's basically the strategy to separate them and fight them like you would any other tree Sentinel the way to do that is to pay very close attention to the tree sentinel's hand the horse itself can also sort of check into you luckily the left side of the boss which is the one with the torch really doesn't do that much damage to you if he sort of checks you with the horse that can de a lot of damage but the torch itself often misses you if you're very close and even if it hits you it's not going to deal much so you want to be very careful not to go really any further down the hill than this if you try to bring the boss back up to the side of Grace it will disengage and sort of run away from you so you will need to re-engage it you can't bring it all the way up and fight it near the side of the grace at least that didn't work for me the boss didn't seem interested in doing that so luckily this fight is very similar to the double Sentinel fight outside of lale capital city which means that this one does not have a shield so it doesn't get any of those crazy leap attacks like the one outside of Fringe folk Hero's grave at the very beginning of the game game other than that there's really not much to say here just avoid the big sweeping attacks from the spear and you'll be able to easily easily Dodge the remainder of its big damage attacks you see here it doesn't get interested when I want to fight it uh close to the side of Grace it starts walking away and it tries to get the attention of its friend but able to bring it back up a little bit with my uh sacred blade beam just to kind of reago it but other than that again there's not much else to say about this one so I'll cut the commentary here and come back when we fight the second one but enjoy the rest of the fight and I hope it helps [Music] okay for the second one what's really nice is if you die to the second one after killing the first one the first one will stay dead so even if you mess this up or if you fall off a cliff or something you don't have to worry you won't have to fight the second one again this one is identical to the one from the very beginning of the game outside of the French folk Hero's grave near the Church of Kay in limb grave what I mean by that is it has this big Shield so you can't really use magic against this one it will reflect it back at you or it will sort of carry it and turn it into Glenstone uh faanes and that can be really tough to deal with so you kind of have to melee this one or use much more powerful magic that it can't necessarily Parry back at you so unfortunately even if you were to stagger this thing you don't get to repost it I've always found that a little bit frustrating about the tree Sentinels but what you can do is use a big charged R2 and the reason I suggest that over just continuously whing on it with r1s is because as soon as you hit it once after it's been stunned it will fully back away way out of range of basically any melee attack so you don't want to waste a few swings and any more stamina than you need to so just use a charge R2 and you'll be okay this gigantic Shield slam here he gets two forms of it one The Shield just kind of comes at you the other one he slams a shield into the ground both of those can be dodged however the timing is a little strange because it feels like the hitbox extends behind the shield and can deal damage even when you're rolling so what you want to do is wait for the absolute last second of when that Shield is about to get close to you or from when it's about to hit the ground and then roll into it and you should be able to avoid the damage and that's it all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guys for Elden ring shadow of

Title: Fallingstar Beast (Hinterland) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: fTRDKzmhMWw
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat the falling star beast in the Hinterlands which I think is technically still scat alus or scat VI this boss is your bog standard falling star beast fight that we all know and love from the base game the only tricky thing is that it's located in an area that requires the oh mother emote to access the oh mother emote can be found just outside of the northern outskirts of Bonnie Village it's on a corpse use that emote in front of the America statue just before the commander gas boss fight and you'll gain access to the Hinterlands and all it has to offer all right so to start the fight you just want to approach this crater and then the falling star Beast will appear through the void and then immediately begin charging at you if it's been a while since you fought a falling star Beast don't worry I'm here to help so that back and forth charge will happen three times the boss will end that charge with a sort of uh upswing with its head it'll dig its head into the ground and then fling some rocks at you the gravity magic you can just run away from as it's happening I was sort of re getting used to the falling star Beast fik cuz I had done it in a while but all the attacks can typically follow up or end with the falling star Beast digging its head into the ground and then flinging rocks at you whenever the boss jumps up in the air and curls up it's going to do a dive at you all you got to do to avoid that is wait for it to get very close to landing and then roll to the right it will Arc to the left and avoid you and then you can go in for a couple hits of damage the the interesting thing about falling star beasts is that they do technically have a weak point it is this white fuzzy stuff on their face that is their weak point the only tough thing is that you can't really get to it a lot of the time because it's made of rock and it's constantly running around so if you can get any sort of targeted damage on the head you're going to find yourself stunning it a lot more often than I am for this charge this is the back and forth three times charge just roll away and then on the third attempt you can try to deal some damage if you're quick up or if you have a quick Ash of war or weapon art should be able to deal some damage but I wouldn't recommend chancing it if you don't have a high Vitality rating because you're just get end up getting chunked for all your damage when you see the boss clicking its pincers that means that it's readying a grab attack so you want to just pay very close attention wait for the head to actually begin moving in your direction and then Dodge don't just start spam dodging when you see the pincers clicking it you will get grabbed almost every single time if you do that so luckily this is not a full grown falling star Beast this is just a regular size falling star Beast which means that you don't have to deal with the crazy Phase 2 uh eyeball attacks where it's doing this whole Doctor Strange mirror Dimension stuff you don't have to deal with that it's just you know standard gravity attacks like this the fourth hit of this attack will generally be a big AOE field you do just have to run out of that but that's really the most you know technical or crazy ability that it has and that's it those are basically all the tips for the falling star Beast if you need any additional help I'll leave links to the other falling star Beast guides uh on my channel in the description but I'll let the rest of the fight play out and I hope this has been helpful to you all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for Elden ring shadow of the UR tree please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the join button below this video you can also leave a super thanks by clicking the heart icon below this video don't forget to join my community Discord the link for that is in the description below as always I'll sweet Johnny Cage thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye-bye [Music] [Music]

Title: Red Bear (Northern Nameless Mausoleum) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: CqGqwnfqTgI
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat red bear in the northern nameless Mausoleum red bear is a PVP style fight with an enemy that uses Beast claws or bear claws as well as has access to bear incantations so these things are like Roars some swipe attacks and a lot of these attacks can build bleed so you need to be very careful when going in on him because sort of has a lot of poise and can just come right back at you with these bleed stacking attacks you can reach the northern nameless melum by going to the row base section of the map and then where I have the flag marker on my map just to the northwest of this location that is a spirit spring that you're able to jump up there's rocks nearby to sort of Break the Barrier around it they're very close by and then just come up to this cliff and then you'll get to the northern nameless Mausoleum so you get here via a cave on scat alus near that lower Lake that I showed just a couple seconds ago okay so for the fight itself it's not terribly difficult but again a lot of these attacks do stack bleed you have to be very very careful of that and of course because it's his a PVP style fight the boss can heal however you just saw there that his armor rating is pretty low so he's going to be susceptible to bleed and any sort of katana is going to deal a decent amount of damage to him his sort of big swipe attacks uh end up allowing him to evade a lot of your attacks so you got to be very careful when you're choosing to attack when he sort of switches uh his hands he's going to typically do a roar attack as you saw there he's taking out his uh maybe his beastclaw seal to try to do some Roar attacks on you so be careful of that but other than that he just kind of spams his L2 weapon ability uh with the bear claw and then can kind of come flying in at you but this might be the easiest of all the maum fights in my opinion any weapon will deal a lot of stagger damage to him because his armor rating is so low so you really won't have too hard of a time on him just pay very close attention to your bleed meter uh bring some boluses if you find yourself getting uh bleed stacked quite a lot you don't want to accidentally take that bonus damage if you don't have to so just use a bolus to get rid of it and you'll be okay but I'll let the rest of the fight play out here and I hope this been helpful to you all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best help you out if you're looking for more guides for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree please please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the join button below this video you can also leave a super thanks by clicking the heart icon below this video don't forget to join my community Discord the link for that is in the description below as always I'll be Johnny Cage thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye-bye

Title: Rugalea the Great Red Bear (Rauh Base) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: gv7xmaDAxm0
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the UR tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat regalia the great red bear in Ru base this is more or less a rune bear fight however this particular bear has access to Bear incantations which in the lore seem to be taken as a bit of a joke but they can deal quite a lot of damage if you're not careful this boss can just be found in an open field uh just be aware that there are smaller lesser bears uh around this field so it's worth scoping the area out for any other bears and then killing them before you fight this one cuz you definitely don't want them interrupting you so you saw there the boss basically opens up with one of those bare incantations it also has access to some of the beastial incantations that gank has so it can rip up the ground it can use Beast Claw on you and sort of Chuck rocks at you but you do need to be very careful of its Roar attacks those are the new bear incantations so you saw there that I was able to get out of that grab without taking too much damage this is a universal I believe mechanic that's hidden in every Souls game with the exception of maybe Dark Souls 2 if you mash L1 and R1 while being grabbed or left bumper right bumper you will get out of the grab early you just have to mash those two buttons and Alternate them just Mash L1 R1 L1 R1 and you'll get out of the grab early this works with basically every single grab attack with the exception of one on the final boss that's for a different reason but any stand standard grab attack that's going to deal a ton of damage to you just Mash L1 and R1 and you'll take a lot less damage and the animation of you getting dropped will be different and you'll actually be able to act again more quickly if you've sort of mashed out of the grab that doesn't mean Mash R1 as soon as you get out of the grab you're still very vulnerable but you're going to recover a lot more quickly than you would normally okay so you've basically seen at this point everything the fight has to offer you got to be very careful of the boss's forward claw swipes those can be empowered with a bar incantation and can deal a bit of like a whirlwind type of damage which is sort of aoe's out in front of the boss however you can just roll behind the boss to avoid that it's not a huge deal with beastclaw right there that ability has always annoyed me I'm the weird one who finds maloth easier than gank I have a really hard time dealing with a lot of these beastial incantations but just pay very close attention to the trail of rocks that that's beginning to fly towards you and then roll forward at the last possible second and you should be able to avoid that damage now just like the Rune bear this boss can stare at you for a second and then immediately begin charging at you that move is pretty difficult to avoid consistently so you got to be very careful just pay very close attention to the boss's face and if you notice that he's staring at you for a second be very ready for that boss to come charging at you and that's basically it I'll let the rest of the fight play out but you've seen all that it has to offer at this point if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for Elden ring shadow of the UR tree please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new guides go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the join button below this video you can also leave a super thanks by clicking the heart icon below this video don't forget to join my community Discord the link for that is in the description below as always I'll speak Johnny Cage thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye-bye for

Title: Death Knight (Scorpion River Catacombs) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: igiKlj2G3Tc
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the UR tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat the death knight boss in the Scorpion River catacombs this boss is more or less the same as the death knight in the fog Rift catacombs however this one uses a two-handed axe or a great Axe instead of the twin axes so just a bit of a different move set but the boss is susceptible to backstabs just the same and you're more or less going to employ the same strategy to reach the Scorpion River catac homes you have to get to raal base and the way to get there is via a cave in scat alus near a small Lake just Northwest of the uh main side of Grace there you really can't miss the lake and then just go through the cave and you'll end up in ra base okay for the fight the boss typically opens with those lightning incantations I do recommend putting on a lamp for this fight just because his hands can be kind of hard to see with the dim lighting so a lamp is really really helpful just put on your quick bar I've always had it on there since the start of the base game so just really really helpful like I said before this boss is very similar to the other death knight in that it is extremely susceptible to backstabs the only difference being that this one's move set uh kind of puts him in different position so you kind of have to run for the backstabs and you can't get them uh necessarily as easily the boss always seems to finish his combos facing you more or less so you do have to try your best to get behind him quickly and and then just keep rinsing and repeating on backstabs if you have any Talisman that increase uh damage from backstabs or can restore your health from backstabs go ahead and use that the boss still has his grab attack where he can heal you it's right here I'm going to get grabbed by it this thing is like the worst thing to get grabbed by because even if the boss is down to like 50% HP he can basically restore himself to full health and he can do this grab at any time it's always available to him I think except maybe at the very start of the fight I haven't ever seen him use it right off the jump but he always has it available so you got to be very very careful he also has this sort of like lightning shoulder charge ability basically as soon as you see the boss spark with lightning get ready for him to charge toward you as long as you don't see um any sort of like runes appear around him when you do see the runes that's basically going to be a lightning spear attack but for everything else once he crouches and then explodes with lightning that's going to be the shoulder charge you got to be very very careful of that particular attack because even if you're blocking it will deal a ton of stamina damage to you and then he will try to break your stance with a very quick follow-up attack so you got to be very careful once you see him Crouch just roll into him and you should be able to dodge that shoulder charge so even though the boss is very susceptible to backstabs they don't necessarily deal a ton of damage to him so even if you are choosing to exploit that strategy it's still going to take you a little while so I wouldn't recommend only going for backstabs do your best to attack him normally whenever you get an opportunity but backstabs are just so so reliable against this boss if you're a magic user you're going to have somewhat of a difficult time just because when you are far away from the boss the boss is going to use his own incantations and start throwing lightning a lot more often than he would if you were in his face so for that reason if you're a sorcery user maybe try using caran failinks or any sort of magic that you can quickly get off while in someone's face similar to a melee timing that's my one suggestion for like a range build is try not to do it from max range otherwise you're going to have to deal with his own lightning attacks but that's basically it you've seen all the fight has to offer at this point so I'll just let it play out and I hope this has been helpful to you all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guys for Elden ring shadow of the UR tree please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the join button below this video you can also leave a super thanks by clicking the heart icon below this video Don't don't forget to join my community Discord the link for that is in the description below as always I'm sweet Johny cage thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye-bye

Title: Furance Golem (Castle Watering Hole) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: jCapb4g329w
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the UR tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat the furnace golum in the castle Watering Hole section of the map this can be reached via a coffin near The Domain of the dragon's painting in Shadow keep so once you find that painting there's an elery wall in that room it's between two torches just go ahead and roll through that you'll find a coffin on the other side that takes you directly to this area it's the only way to reach this area you have to use that coffin okay this is a fairly standard furnace Golem boss fight this is not one of the ones where you Chuck uh fire pots into the furnace Golem instead for this one you just uh fight it normally so what I recommend doing is trying to clear the area out of all the furnace visages this way you get you know a bit more of a cleaner view you don't have to worry about the items on the ground and you're not tempted to pick them up while fighting the boss so as always you want to do your best to stay behind the boss and under its legs this way you can deal as much damage to its legs and get it to fall over you need it to fall twice or three times depending on how much damage you can do and then get that critical hit um on the mask so all we're doing is double jumping over the flame attacks whenever it Stomps once chances are it's going to stomp twice and then really the only other flame attack that the boss has in this form at least if you're close range is a big jump attack with that attack I I recommend trying to get as far far away as possible because fire will lift off the ground and start coming toward you if you're not careful you can get hit by that and I'm going to get hit by that in this attempt here um the reason I say be careful with getting far away from him is because if you get too far away he can use this fire Cyclone attack from the furnace itself and sort of chase after you with it if you notice that the boss is starting to do that try to ride in as quickly as possible that flame vent attack actually has a pretty big wind up so you should be able to get back near the boss before it actually can sort of push those Flames toward you but be very very careful when trying to get away from this boss because that attack can deal a ton of damage and more or less one shot you if you're not careful and then you'll just have to redo this but other than that just employ the same strategy you've been employing on furnace Golems the whole game chop at their legs after three stuns they'll fall down look for the mask with the critical hit marker on it plunge your weapon in there there and then do that one more time and the boss will go down I'll let the rest of the fight play out but there's no more tips all right if you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when new videos go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the join button below this video you can also leave a super thanks by clicking the heart icon below this video don't forget to join my community Discord the link for that is in the description below as always I'm sweet John Cage thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye-bye I

Video ID: ZK8tMqhu3jA
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to defeat Rock shasa in the Eastern nameless Mausoleum this Mausoleum can be accessed via the recluse river which itself is a hidden area that can only be accessed by finding the secret coffin exit from Shadow keep if you know where the domain of dragon's painting is it's in the same room there's just an elus wall in that room roll through that elery wall and you'll be on the other side with the coffe I will leave a link in the description below for how to reach that it's it's the guide for the painting but it shows you the route to take uh in completion so from start to finish it'll show you the route to take and you'll be able to reach this area and the mausoleum the build that I'm using here really doesn't matter too much did this at level 204 with a level 16 scattery blessing using Yuji gatana this boss herself uses a gray Katana which has a pretty big range it's sort of like a gry katana version of rivers of blood doesn't have the same weapon art but it does have the same amount of uh very very large bleed stacking even while blocking so you got to be very careful with this particular weapon the boss loves to use the sweeping strikes uh weapon art that is on this weapon and you'll get the weapon at the end of the fight however as you can see here the boss is extremely susceptible to backstabs so if you can get in close you can very easily backstab the boss over and over just again be very careful of the bleed buildup it's not a bad idea to bring bleed boluses with you to drop that bar back down to zero if you ever get too high you never want to take accidental bleed damage that could have could have been prevented so bring bises if you find yourself uh getting too close to the Limit with that bleed bar okay so unfortunately the boss like sort of backed me off a bit and when it's using these sweeping strikes even for the second hit it can spin back around and retarget you instantly it is very much locked onto you while it's using those sweeping strikes so even if the first one misses and you're behind it you got to be very very careful uh to not get hooked up by the second one so you saw there my bleed bar got really high I didn't have bleed bises on my quick bar but I was able to menu to them really fast and uh managed to get myself healed up so because this is a PVP fight the boss herself can heal you got to be mindful of that there are ways to pressure the boss over and over and over and this same goes for any PVP fight there are ways to pressure them over and over to prevent them from healing but it's unreliable and you often end up having to be in their face all the time which just exposes you to other abilities so you do have to be careful of that you're better off just letting them heal and then just sort of treating that as like part of their life bar but other than that youve basically seen all the fight has to offer be very careful with those sweeping strikes feel free to use any uh sort of Ashes of war that you have that may stun the boss but she's susceptible to backstab so just keep fishing for those and you should be fine all right if you have any questions questions please feel free to leave a comment I'll do my best to help you out if you're looking for more guides for Elden ring shadow of the UR tree please subscribe to the channel so you get alerted when you guys go live if you're interested in supporting the channel monetarily please consider becoming a channel member by clicking the join button below this video you can also leave a super thanks by clicking the heart icon below this video don't forget to join my community Discord the link for that is in the description below as always I'll be Johnny Cage thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time bye-bye [Music] [Music] for [Music]

Title: Jori, Elder Inquisitor (Darklight Catacombs) - Full Narrated Boss Guide - Elden Ring [4k HDR]
Video ID: nPek-1jLwBY
Transcript Text:
hey everyone sweet Johnny Cage here back with another guide for Elden ring shadow of the earth tree this time I'm going to show you how to take down Jory Elder Inquisitor the boss of the darklight Catacombs the darklight catacombs are somewhat hidden in the game they are probably one of the last things you're going to do if you're looking for map fragments because you have to go through the dark light catacombs in order to reach the Abyssal Woods the dark light catacombes themselves are somewhat hidden they are along the recluse river section of the map which itself is also very hidden the way to reach this place is via a coffin inside of Shadow keep I will leave a link in the description for my guide on the domain of dragon's painting the domain of dragon painting is right in front of the elusory wall that you need to break in order to get into a coffin that brings you to recluse River so from the main gate Plaza just go up the stairs look for a ladder along the right side that'll take you down to sort of like the the sewage area and then just find the painting and you're good to go but I'll leave a link in the description for that and then as you go through the reck loose River you will find the dark light catacombs at the end and then defeating this boss will give you access to the Abyssal Woods which is probably if you're like me the last major section of the map that you haven't gained access to yet okay so starting off in this fight the boss will cast these incantations where she's just sort of throwing Rune arcs at you you also need to be very careful of the spir ability that she can use luckily though she seems to cast it for a very long time then you can just run up and get a back stab now you may think that the boss fight is going to be easy and that's all you got to contend with but no she can teleport and then she can also summon more uh Elders to help her she will summon a group of Elders at a time uh usually two or three lesser ones along with a giant one and that giant one is going to be a problem the reason it's a problem is because it can constantly try to push you back and then you're not going to be able to get to the boss so what you want to do is deal with the Lesser ones very quickly and then try to give some distance between the boss and the giant one and then deal with the giant one luckily uh Jory is very weak to bleed she has very light armor so you don't really have to worry about it too much but as you can see here we've got a full Squad of four Elders along with the giant one I'm just do my best to deal with them try to get them in front of me this way like one slash will kill the Lesser ones they are ghosts so luckily they die in just one hit but for the the bigger on you got to try to do your best to get it separated from the boss while you're dealing with that the boss will continue to cast spir so if you can get some distance between the big one and the boss go Rush the boss hit her so she stops doing that spir ability and then you can focus on the ghosts you'll also notice that the ghosts just disappear after a while the Phantom ones so what you could do is just constantly run away wait for them to fade away another thing you can do is equip the the Brier armor the Brier armor deals damage when you roll into things I'm not sure if one roll will actually kill the ghosts but it seems like they don't actually have a health bar so they may just have one HP and all you really need to do is deal any amount of damage to them and then you should be able to uh get them to go away that's another strategy that you could try I was using the death knight armor cuz it just looks so cool and then yeah that's it so basically the fight goes on be careful the teleport it does deal damage on its way out very similar to rigan when he teleports into you uh you can end up taking a bunch of damage from that that's no good so just be very careful the teleport do your best to roll through it and of course the giant Elder can really just come out of nowhere like a wrestler and just jump on you so it's very very important that you try to whittle the boss down very quickly and then when the boss dies all of the ghosts die along with them so if you're like me and the boss was at one hit just chase her down hit her she'll die everything dies and you're done and that's it all right enjoy the Abyssal Woods the math fragment is just all the way at the end of the road just keep following the road and you'll find it in a church and that's it all right if you have any questions please feel

Title: How To Defeat Tree Sentinel (Golden Halberd Location) - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: -kjDtMwjjOo
Transcript Text:
hey guys welcome to a boss guide I don't know how to do this it's unscripted so it is what it is uh basically I'm doing an eldering playthrough where I'm going to be teaching people how to fight every unique boss in Elven ring I know not a lot of new players just got the game for the holidays as well as just a lot of people that are struggling with bosses in this game I did just start this brand new character as you can see I started as a warrior because I have two scimitars and I have the base stats so we're gonna defeat the very first boss that we find in the game which is the tree Sentinel over there now you do not have to fight this boss at the very beginning of the game if you do not want to you can level up and come back here later but I always like to fight at the very beginning of the game because this just kind of helps me get warmed up for the rest of the game and also helps me understand the move set of the type of weapon that I'm choosing to use on this playthrough so as you can see he's on a giant golden horse and he has a giant golden Halbert and a golden shield now we're talking about the moves that the tree Sentinel will do while he does them the very first one is that charge slash you just gotta roll through it very easy to dodge and then you have this jump attack and that jump attack actually will go into two different directions I'm almost dead already so as you can see the very first one is when he does that jump attack he'll actually be able to poke you with the top of the halberd as well what you want to do there is just roll out of the way of that and then you have this one and then he does the underhand attack and then the overhand slam after the overhand slam you can land a good three to five basic attacks depending on your weapon there and then just kind of run away afterward sometimes they'll walk up to you and do a basic halberd swing and then he does this charge again so basically you just want to make sure that you play carefully you want to make sure that you're not just kind of going willy-nilly and attacking non-stop that's not what Eldon ring is about it's more about attacking at the right moments after the boss does their moves it's more about reacting than acting I would say for a good ninety percent of the gameplay as you can see I'm really capitalizing on the uh the big combo there after he slams down the halberd I'm able to land a good 3-4 attacks without any any risk so let's Dodge that again so far I was hit twice but that's okay we're just getting our legs that's the Poke I'm talking about right there with that one you can attack once or twice after he does that because most of the time he'll run away but if he does not run away there you want to make sure that you do because he can attack and do a lot of damage really quick as we've already seen so we're just gonna hit him twice here he's gonna run away so we're good and we already got him down a quarter of his health Dodge through that once again Dodge through that once again now generally speaking I I know this game well enough to where I can I can find a lot more windows of opportunity to attack because this is going to be a very basic guide I do not want anyone to take any unnecessary risks so that way you can just kind of get through the boss in the easiest way possible now we did see the horse stand up on its hind legs and then slam on the ground with its front legs that attack will do damage to you so you want to make sure that you're not near it when it does that you can dodge it last second if you choose but I would recommend just getting away from it all right we're at the point now where the tree Sentinel is going to do the shield slams onto the ground when you see those uh when you see that Shield come out and you need to back away immediately you do not want to be anywhere near the boss when it slams onto the ground it has a massive area it's actually rather deceiving so make sure you back way up away from it get those attacks in there's that ground slam we rolled out of there comes the swing now you see uh the music just changed so this means that tree Sentinel is going into phase two you'll be you'll often find a lot of bosses in this game have two phases and a lot of the time you can see there's or hear their second phase by the music or you'll see a physical change in them there was another Shield slam as well as the halberd swing we're able to dodge that we have this here comes the poke we dodged for the back attack twice I got hit by the shield slam because I dodged too warly you want to make sure that you're not panicking your dodges like I did there let's back it up here comes the jump attack here comes the Poke we attack [Music] we Dodge The Shield slam we back it up there's another big Shield slam that has the widest range out of all of its attacks that Shield slams specifically you need to be nowhere in the vicinity when the tree Sentinel does that now if you are using projectiles like magic or arrows like some of the classes can start with you need to be aware that the tree Sentinel can deflect with his shield he can deflect magic specifically and when he does deflect it he'll actually send a holy attack back at you so make sure that if you are sending projectiles towards him that you are very ready to dodge after you cast your spells there's the horse slam there's another Shield slam you can attack after the shield slam if you get in quick enough but I recommend just staying away it's just not really worth getting in close to that because it does so much damage there's this there's the coke the attack twice there's a shield slam we back up let's get a quick running attack there's the the horse lunge and there's another overhead slam so as you can see a lot of this is just about the the pacing of it dodging most of the attacks and just taking advantage of the open opportunities that you as a player will have after the tree sandal finishes his own combos specifically when he does the overhand slam attacks with the halberd is the ones that you want to capitalize on the most we're gonna get one attack there because he's gonna Spin and shield slam or no that was the horse slam and then a shield slam the biggest attack of opportunity is when he does this attack but it's the underhand scoop into the overhand slam with the halberd I'm actually gonna wait to kill him until that specific moment so that way you can see what I mean jump attack there's the Poke we do not want that one the attack I'm talking about is the widest opportunity you'll have to land a ton of damage and specifically note my positioning I try to stay behind his right leg while he's doing the uh the attack so that way he'll do the uh specific scoop and then overhand attack because that gives you the biggest opportunity to land your damage I messed it up that time when you do get behind his leg is when he has more opportunity to do the screw part of that combo so we're gonna try to proc it here on this next leap attack sometimes it can be hard to roll into like right here this should be good it's not good my mistake stay away from him Dodge the basic swings here comes the jump why aren't you doing the scoop tree Sentinel you're making me look bad man stay away from the shield slams those things hurts a lot that's a basic poke avoid that guys he won't do the scoop he won't do the scoop I need him to scoop me up I need him to do it so bad scoop me guys he won't do it yeah he knows he knows that I need it right now what the heck tree Sentinel I'm waiting until he does it I'm waiting until he does it all right this should be it right here there it is now wait see how we stay to the back of this horse while he's doing that slam I'm able to land a good three to five hits in that moment and that's the moment that you want to take to land as much damage as possible but do not get greedy if you get greedy he will punish you with a follow-up swing or horse lunge or maybe even a shield slam if he's in phase two so after you land between three and five attacks even if you do think you have time for that fifth attack if you're cutting it close you're best off just getting out of there okay and that is how you defeat the tree Sentinel even as a brand new character again my character is only level 8 which is the very base level of the Warriors starting class in Elden ring and we defeated him with no weapon advancements whatsoever you can see my weapons are plus one uh everything is very minimal I have no talismans and I have just the basic starting stuff and that is our guide for the tree Sentinel at the very beginning of the game thank you so much for watching thank you for leaving a like comment and subscribing to my channel and I'll

hey guys thank you for tuning in for another Elden ring boss guide video this time we're taking on a Geo you can find that agile is spawned in over there now I this is the second time I'm doing this as I you know I died on the first attempt making this guy don't judge me uh but there's actually a bonfire with a bunch of Aristocrat Nobles on the ground there and a Geo will crash land on top of them spawning in for the very first time you'll see that it is right there right in front of us not hard to see at all in this bit of land right here in the middle of the lake what you want to do is basically just stay out of the way when it's crashing down and then you can commence the fights let's go ahead and get in there we'll discuss the moves that the dragon can do and I'll show you how I attack it you'll see that I do choose to fight it from horseback as I find it easiest for mobility in this type of fights the dragon will always start to fight off by screaming as well so you'll have a moment to land some attacks and then you'll see that you bit my horse's ass but that's okay we can heal it up he does swing his wings sometimes but the main focus of this fight is getting in hitting his leg and then getting out I call it the toe strategy you can see that the dragon does jump away there and then follows it up with a fire breath you want to make sure that you go around the fire breath I choose to go to my left because I find the easiest Dodge but as long as you don't get hit by the fire you can get around him really quickly and land some free attacks there's a big bite do not let that hit you early game it will one shot you and then of course there's the stops the dragon will stop with both feet very often while you're underneath and behind us so be aware of that okay so this time the dragon's flying up in the air and stomping on the ground what you want to do is basically try to stay directly underneath it and ride around in a small circle because then it will basically go in One Direction or the other allowing you to not get hit by it there's more Stomps the strategy for attacking it underneath in between its own attacks is making sure that if you see the dragon's feet moving You're Not underneath the dragon at all the dragon is taking steps or about to stop you get the heck out of there outside of that you just kind of stay underneath it and keep keep hitting those toe beans man there's another jump attack but this time he unleashes fire on the ground you want to make sure that you're not in that fire just like any other fire it hurts there's another dragon breath let's hit the toes the toe strats very good there's a Stomp here's a bites after the bite you can often attack it in the face for increased damage so that's something to consider as well all right the feet are moving we get out of the way the big stompage a lot of the time as long as you're very consistent about your attacks as well you'll actually be able to knock the dragon down for a critical hit too so that's something to watch out for but as you can see the strategy is just basically staying underneath it into the side of it all right this is its main attack that's the one that's a lot of people fear the most but it's actually pretty easy to dodge you know fly up in the air and then do a big spray of fire in a straight line the good news is when it does that it'll always it always face its left and if you're facing the dragon at that time it'll go to your right so basically you just want to go to the opposite side to get out of the way you don't have to worry about it much at all you can see that the main ticket here is mobility and that's why I choose to do this from horseback as long as you're moving around constantly the dragon has a really hard time hitting you and so that's the that's the strategy that I like to teach people here Mobility is key in this fight against the dragons I'm not sure if we're gonna get a knock down here or not that's okay let's boot the snoots has hit the legs all right there's a Dragon Breath Again let's get underneath it there's the wing swing back those toes kill that dragonfly on accident very good here's a stomp again waiting for stamina to regen hit the toes more oh there's that knock down as you can see if you hit it enough quickly enough you'll actually break the dragon's Poise you want to ride towards its face and attack the glowing eye for a critical hit that's the Dragon and this Dragon will give you right around 5 000 runes look like it's 5250 and a dragon heart that you can use to learn some incantations at the Cathedral of dragon communion which is pretty cool a lot of cool spells there anyways guys that's how I defeat a Geo of the uh the lake here and I hope this guide helped you thank you for leaving a like a comment and subscribing and I'll see you guys soon for more

Transcript Text:
[Music] hey guys thank you for tuning in for another Elden ring boss guide this time we're taking on an erdtree Watchdog uh this one you can find specifically at stormfoot catacombs very close to the beginning of the game so you will likely stumble upon this while you're exploring for the first time now this uh the Watchdogs have some pretty interesting moves that can catch you off guard if you're not ready for them so let's begin the first thing you want to watch for from these guys is they will do pretty big ground pounds and they'll often combine a bunch of these to make it so they do it anywhere from two to eight times it gets pretty crazy there's the third one the next thing they'll do is a bit of a sword lunge let's see if we can pull that out of them there's the sword lunge you want to dodge to the left or right do not Dodge backwards on that because it has surprising range and unless you're already very very far away then it will hit you you want to make sure you're you're ready for that let's see if we can get him to do that attack again so we can talk about it you can see that by the fact that his tail is on fire I thought it away the fact that his tail is on fire means that he will do fire breath sometimes you'll notice that he does the fire breath most most of the time after landing a bunch of attacks on him okay so now that you see that he's on his back legs what you want to do is he's he's going to swing the sword at you in a very quick fashion just like that you can uh run away from him constantly but he will catch up a lot of times you need to make sure you're ready to dodge if you need to what you want to do is if you see his arm go up you want to dodge right away at that moment dodging while the sword is already up in the air should guarantee that you won't get hit by it and so you want to wait for that moment specifically to do so all right watch this watch How I dodge once the arm goes up see that from there he does a lot of basic sword swings now you can see right there just a basic ground pound there's another sword lunge he'll also do some horizontal attacks if you see that he puts his sword flat to the ground you want to just run away or Dodge away from him at that moment because it does a surprising amount of mobility in which I'll try to show you I'll try to pull that attack out of him in a moment here's the fifth one of those let's Dodge when the arm goes up boom land some attacks here there's a basic sword swing you see it's pretty easy to get away from those attacks specifically so realistically the only threat is his ground pound and then the one where he gets on his hind legs and comes at you those are the ones you want to watch out for the most here's the fire breath when the fire breath comes out you want to just move towards his tail and stay behind his tail the longer he does the fire breath the faster he moves there's a horizontal attack we had to dodge away another sword lunge let's Dodge when the arm goes up land some attacks you can land a good 2-3 attacks with most weapons at that moment so that's when you want to strike the most sword lunge we can land a couple attacks here there's the horizontal swing you see how we actually swung twice there with that spin it can catch you off guard really quickly so you want to make sure you are ready for it here comes the ground pounds again sword lunge we attacked a couple times oh we got hit by that another sword lunge let's get in a quick attack here comes the fire breath we stay behind him now keep in mind if you do cross the threshold of the uh the tail it'll actually turn the other direction so you want to make sure you're ready for that and then if you're still behind him after the fire breath he'll often ground pound with the tail there it's not often you see that attack so you don't worry about it too much but just be ready for it and there you go that's the Earth tree burial Watchdog now you will find several of these throughout the games including a different variety one with a staff that can cast a couple spells we'll make another video based on that one later on when we find it but until then guys thank you for watching thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I hope this video helped you I'll see you soon for more [Music]

Title: How To Defeat Stonedigger Troll (Roar Medallion Location) - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: EJifjkx0UR4
Transcript Text:
hey everyone welcome to another Elden ring boss guide this time we're taking on the stone Digger troll that you can find in Lim grave tunnels you can find this tunnel just by riding through the water here and you'll find the entrance to it you go through the dungeon you'll eventually find yourself fighting this guy right here this giant troll now he does have a giant hammer that can do big damage so I'm gonna be talking specifically about how to avoid that damage now this boss is going to be easiest I'll be honest this boss is easiest if you have a weapon that can do strike damage like a club or a hammer or if you can cast spells okay so here's this main attack The Stomp and then he Swings with the club a whole bunch of times while he runs around you can see by the way I'm dodging I'm basically just trying to like avoid him for the first few swings and then roll under his legs for the final part the next thing you want to watch out for is he does a whole bunch of Stomps like basic swamp wow basic Stomps which are really fast and hard to get out of the way of so be aware of that as well let's go ahead and land our first attack you can see that based on my sword it being a slash weapon the sword basically bounces off then it still damage but it bounces off so if you are using a slash weapon you want to make sure that you're doing jump attacks like so because the jump attacks will not bounce off they don't do as much damage as they probably should but uh all the same that's just the nature of this boss because he has very hard skin you can see that it's a lot of his attacks are based on his Feats he does a lot of stomping and then smashing of the hammer on the ground swing and a big pound we do some jumping attacks and then we get out of the way here comes his big attack he basically just throws a temper tantrum and hammers the ground like five times okay that was four times and then he'll have a moment to recover when he takes that moment to recover is when he wants to land your attacks now that big smash right there is something I find difficult to avoid even to this day and but he does have another attack like that as well where he'll smash the ground and then he'll actually have the hammer inside of the ground and it'll do damage after he pulls the hammer back up as well I'm sure he'll be doing it before too long here so keep an eye out for it ouch as you can see because I'm using a slashing weapon the most effective thing that I'm able to do is just jump attacks they do the most damage with a slash weapon there's that attack I was talking about where it does extra damage after the pull outs you can see that the jump attack is very effective there's that high speed stomp that I mentioned and that's the game to basically avoid his feet as much as you can after you land your attacks you just need to get out of there watch out for the range of the actual ground pound attacks because it's not just the club that hits you but the wave of the like the the shock wave that goes out from the club from there you just want to avoid that damage but also the big thing you need to keep it out for is when he throws his tantrum and then hits the ground really hard and then pulls the club out of the ground for the extra attack you need to watch out for that it does big damage early on in the game and I just I cannot stress enough how important it is to get out of the way of that again if possible make sure you bring strike Weaponry here or magic as it is the most effective against him but I wanted to Showcase specifically using slash Weaponry a lot of people think that slash Weaponry just cannot be used here but it absolutely can as long as you're doing jump attacks or heavy R2 attacks you just dropped the roar Medallion as well which is pretty cool if you're using any type of Roar stuff yourself with that said I'm out of here guys thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

Title: How To Defeat Bloodhound Knight Darriwil (Bloodhound's Fang Location) - Elden Ring Gameplay Guide
Video ID: MGdp5ASqvpw
Transcript Text:
hey everyone welcome back to the channel for another eldering boss guy this time we're taking on Bloodhound Knight Dara will which you can find at the forlorn Hound error jail in Lim grave it is likely the first ever jail that you'll attempt in your playthrough um is either that of The Crucible night essentially but all you have to do is go Southeast from the first step where you start the game you'll find it right there a lot of people like to take on this fight early on because it gives you a very large curved sword that is effective throughout most of the game so let's go and get started in this video I'll be teaching you how to dodge parry and counter-attack the Bloodhound Knights now to make him spawn you'll you have to go towards the glowing purple stuff on the ground right there when he does spawn you'll have a couple of moments to land two or three attacks depending on what he does so you want to make sure that you open up the fight swinging away uh there is going to be one specific attack that I'm going to teach you how to Parry which is his claw attack where he'll try to uppercut you with the claws after dragging them on the ground it's incredibly easy to time parrying and it's one of the easiest to Parry attacks that he has so that's the one that will focus on parrying there from there the entire fight will be dodging and counter-attacking so let's get started like I said you can land a couple attacks there to really get the fight started now you'll see that he has Bloodhound staff that's where Bloodhound step comes from he'll he'll Bloodhound step towards you and then do often a three attack combo which you just want to make sure that you get out of the way of that right there I messed it up though let's go ahead and try to get his claw attack out you'd see that he drags a sword around and just kind of tries to hit you with it but it's easy to dodge you just want to make sure that you're out of the way of his horizontal swings mostly those are the ones that'll hit you with the most you'll need to dodge two or three times to avoid them and also make sure you stay out of the uh the foliage there he also willed lunge at you sometimes as well and do like sword slams and swings like that you want to make sure you're out of the way of that okay there you go there's the Perry basically once he gets right in front of you just Perry you don't have to worry about timing it or anything it's literally just once he's in front of you hit the L2 button to Parry and it's good to go it's incredibly easy to Parry you don't even have to think about it he once he closes that Gap and he's right in front of you hit L2 and it's done from there a lot of this is just a matter of waiting patiently for the right moment to strike it's that one up but that's okay you can see that if you missed the uh the Perry on the claw attack he'll follow it up with a overhand sword attack so you want to make sure that you dodge out of the way of that one as well and overall you can see he doesn't actually have that much help even very early on in the game you can see I'm only level 19 at this point in the game and he's really not hitting me for too much damage that's unrealistic and we are doing a ton to him let's go ahead and Parry that claw attack one more time so I can show you guys how it's uh how easy it is to Parry hopefully I don't fail it again and make myself look like a fool [Music] come on man do it for me here it is you see just do it just Perry once he's in front of you it's super easy all right from there let's talk about counter-attacking you can see that he has a lot of attacks that just kind of he goes crazy with Once he's done with his three swing combo he'll basically jump up like that but before he jumps up you can land an attack and then if you dodge after he does the fourth part of that combo you'll have another moment to land another heads I'm going to show you how to do that again as I didn't do it well the first time but this time I will do it better let's get him to do it again we Dodge we Dodge we Dodge we attack he jumps we Dodge we attack again then we back off it's that easy you can basically repeat that same cycle over and over again until he's dead we'll do it one more time attack oh sometimes he'll follow up with that attack I forgot he does that but basically if you see him doing like a Charged attack just get out of the way of it you know pretty straightforward here's the claw I missed the Parry but he's dead anyway so as you can see that I did mess up a few things here but that's okay because he doesn't really do all that much damage and you get Bloodhounds Fang for defeating him the main idea is just making sure that you parry at the right moment if you're choosing to Parry and then from there you want his main combo if he does anything other than his main combo I would say don't attack at all I would say your best bet is to wait until he does that combo where he swings three times you attack once he jumps up in the air and does a sword slam and then you attack again and back off even if you have a very basic weapon no extra levels to it you'll still do a lot of damage with that base idea anyways guys thank you for tuning in for another Elden ring boss guide thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

Transcript Text:
hey guys welcome to another Elden ring boss guide this time we're talking about patches patches you can find right here in the Merck water cave towards the beginning of the game in Lim grave you basically just uh ride your horse up the river here and then you'll stop right here just outside this gate outside of this cave you'll have to fight an Invader named bloody finger narius after you defeating Arius you'll be free to enter this cave and make your way down to the boss room in this fight you are able to leave patches alive if you choose to but in this playthrough specifically I'm going to show you how I defeat him he's actually very easy despite him having a tower shield with a long-range spear to make him spawn you have to enter the room and then open this chest when you open the chest he jumps down from up there after talking some smack as you can see right here yeah now there's one key attack they need to watch out for that patches will do he'll take a moment to blow some reddish brown stuff at you when he does that you can run at him and attack him for free you get in there you attack you roll out now you have to be careful because this reddish brown stuff does decrease your attack as you can see on the top left uh side underneath my stamina bar you'll see this sword with the down arrow that means my attack is down and every time he does it you're able to land a free hit on him and then back off he's very easy for that reason alone outside of that you can just roll out of the way of his attacks just completely avoid them wait until he does that specific breath attack roll in hit him back off now if you do want to get crazy you can backstab him if you want a critical hit there's nothing wrong with that but halfway through the fight he'll ask for mercy you don't have to be merciful if you don't want to but if you do have mercy you'll have a quest you can do with him later on this playthrough I'm not doing that so basically you'll see I'm gonna attack him it did change up the dynamic of the boss fight a little bit he no longer has like the boss health bar but the strategy Remains the Same after the facts it's very easy to kill him you just gotta wait for that attack and then hit him I would not recommend going up and against his Tower Shield or his spear his spear is actually plus seven as well so if you are using thrusting weapons or Spears in general killing Patch's early game will give you a huge power boost early on I'm just gonna keep doing the same tactic I'm gonna actually try to backstab him if he does the breath attack again he's holding off on it for a while sometimes he'll do this where he'll just stop doing it all together which can be pretty annoying there it is he went to heal oh do the breath attack patches do it do it there it is get behind him oh he rolled out of the backstab you see that crazy there's the breath again we backstab and as you can see as long as you keep abusing that specific attack he's not hard to kill at all now the good news is if you do choose to defeat him he does drop his Bell bearing which means you can give this Bell bearing to the uh the Crone at the round table hold and you'll be able to buy the same items that patches would normally sell like the stone sword key um I think he has uh Margaret's shackle stuff like that so you'll be able to buy stuff from that specifically still if you do so as you can see as well there's the spear plus seven you get his leather armor sets and that's pretty much it thank you guys for tuning in for my guide for patches I appreciate your company thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

hey guys welcome to another Elden ring boss guide video this time we're talking about the Mad pumpkin head that you can find at the Waypoint ruins in Lim grave this is an enemy that will be considered a non-boss for a lot of the game later on but you'll find this one and a couple other ones are considered bosses at some points in the game this is the likely the very first one you'll come across the Mad pumpkin head now on the other side of this room you'll find a an NPC named selin but let's discuss how to defeat the Mad pumpkin head before we talk about selling you'll see that the Mad pumpkin head has a flail and he has a giant pumpkin brass pumpkin on his head it's either it's either brass bronze or copper one of those three based on the coloring but I don't know either way that's not that doesn't matter its head has a very large amount of uh damage negations you want to try to avoid hitting it as you can see dodging his flail attacks is very simple you just wait for the flail to come out and you avoid it now keep in mind that he can punch with his left hand and his left hand is something you can Parry another thing to keep in mind is you cannot Parry the flail flails are a non-periable weapon in this game no matter how many times you try you will never Parry a flail no matter where it's coming from whether it's coming from other players or NPCs you'll never be able to actually Parry it so keep that in mind when you're playing now I'm going to show you how to Parry the fist you'll see that he does this ground pound and then punches if you parry the fists you can land a big Critical Strike and then you can basically just get right in front of them and then do a heavy R2 to land some extra damage you'll also sometimes just flat out punch which is okay too but outside of that you can just kind of avoid his flails and get behind him attack him like so sometimes they'll head pound like that it's very slow and very easy to dodge you can see overall that he's not too bad to fight specifically if you're dodging or parrying no matter what you're doing it's easy and if you're casting spells it's even easier because the uh the Spells will generally just hit his main body as you can see it's very nuts it's very very simple to just kind of Harry if you're pairing or dodging if you're dodging now keep in mind that you don't want to hit the helmet you see how I do only to 26 damage by hitting the helmet there you want to avoid that whenever possible do not hit the helmet if you can avoid it it's just kind of a waste of your stamina and your attempts there you go mad pumpkin heads are not too bad to fight guys they're not too bad anyways I hope this video helps you thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

hey everyone welcome to another Elden ring boss guide this time we're going to be taking on a Golem the one that we find here in high road cave in Lim grave you do get to this High Road cave by going down this path and then getting to this bridge with a mad pumpkin head on it what you want to do is jump off the south side of the bridge where the Wellspring is the Wellspring will actually save you from taking fall damage and then you can just walk up the uh the river here and you'll see the entrance to the cave right there when you get to the end of the cave you'll find this giant doorway leading to a Golem let's talk about how to kill this Golem now you'll see that there's some glowing red parts to the Golem or orange parts that's where you want to attack those are its weak point when standing up you can just walk up and hit it for free but they need to you need to immediately back away because they'll start pounding the ground with his with his halberd and then when you're standing away they'll charge up some different attacks this time he did his running attack where he puts it on the ground and then throws rocks at you now the best way to fight him is wait for him to do a Charged Albert attack like this one right here and then Dodge when you dodge you can just walk up to his leg hit it a few times and then back off make sure that you don't do you'll get crushed by that on repeat now we're gonna wait for him to do another charged attack so he can walk up to his legs if you do attack him enough you'll be able to knock him down and get a major critical hit on his chest we'll do which will do massive amounts of damage I was out of stamina there so I wasn't able to run unfortunately here comes another charge attack now something to keep in mind is because it is a guardian Golem he also can spray fire like this right here so if we start spraying fire you just need to walk away the fire will do a lot of damage and knock you over so you need to make sure you walk away from him and then once the fire is done you can walk up slice his ankle and then walk over and stab him in the chest now if you look you can see that the uh the critical attack did over 2 000 damage depending on your actual critical scaling you'll be able to do even more than that there's been some instances where I've been able to do over 20 000 damage with a single Critical Hits now this is one of the few boss versions of this in the entire game but this applies to all iron golems that have the halberd and even the ones with the bows you can walk up to them hit them in the ankles knock them over even if their ankles are not glowing orange you can walk up to them knock them down eventually stab them in the chest for a ton of damage with the critical hits if the critical hit doesn't kill them I guarantee you they'll be under a quarter health and they'll be easy to kill from there with that said I'm out of here for now thank you so much for watching this video I hope the guide helps thank you for liking commenting and subscribing driving and I'll see you next time

Title: How To Defeat Crucible Knight (Sword Variant) - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: 42y8mXGgL4U
Transcript Text:
hey guys welcome to my channel for another Elden ring boss guide this time we're talking about The Crucible night the specifically the sword and shield wielding Crucible Knight that we can find at this ever jail here the storm Hill ever jail likely the first or second ever jail you will discover in the game that you can fight in Lim grave towards the beginning of the game I'm gonna teach you how I defeat it both by dodging and parrying I generally fight these mostly by parrying but I'm going to show you guys specifically how I go about it with dodging as well because a lot of people think that it's not possible and it very much so is it just has very tight timing so what I'm going to do is I'm going to do nothing but parrying in the first half of the fight so you see what I mean by you know the Parry windows and then I will focus on meleeing it without parrying in the second half of the fight so you can see that it is possible even with the tail whipping going on like crazy with that said let's get started foreign as always when you open up a fight with the ever jail you can get in two or three attacks really quickly something to keep in mind with The Crucible Knight is most of its attacks are payable every single sword strike outside of when it's wielding the swords with two hands is completely periable so you don't have to worry about much of anything there the only thing you need to worry about with The Crucible Knight is the shield attack and then the stomp with the uh the rock waves going out if you dodge those everything else is pretty simple in fact I would recommend if you want to learn to Parry this Crucible Knight will teach you a lot this is exactly where I learned to Parry pretty well there's the rock attack that I'm mentioning you can Parry that one as well you want to make sure you not do not get hit by those ground Stomps because they can cause a little bit of a stagger which means they'll be able to follow up with a sword attack and it does devastating damage once I get into phase two you'll see that you'll see his transformation you'll see him do like a stomp on the ground he'll glow gold and he'll grow some wings and start flying at you at that moment is when I'll teach you how to beat him with only dodging you can do the dodging in the first half as well but a lot of people talk about how difficult it is specifically in the second half of the fights so I'm going to do it specifically there so that way I can teach you guys those moments you should Shield strike for the next attack Here There It Is roll out of the way of that do a quick sword strike and back off this is one of the two-handed attacks he'll stop and then slash the sword onto the ground if you're far away he won't follow it up with another attack but if you are close it'll actually follow it up with a 360 horizontal attack Swinging The Sword twice do you want to be aware of that be very careful of it all right he might go phase two here nope all right now we should phase two when he does that we'll put the shield away so there's no more parries here it is phase two now he's gonna grow go grow wings fly up in the sky and then lunge at you you can jump over him at the apex of the uh the rush there but you can also Dodge through it now from now on during phase two you see that tail attack whenever your melee range he will do that after every single one of his attacks if you're close enough so we're gonna teach you exactly how to attack in these moments here's another one of these I'll show you the Dodge roll you can dodge towards him or to the side but never Dodge backwards against that wing attack because it will hit you the hitbox the theory is is you want to make the hitbox as small as possible by passing through it so as long as you pass through it by jumping or dodging to forward or to the side it will never hit you now let me show you how I attack through the uh through the tail you basically just want to do one or two attacks after the tail I generally stick to one because it's safer just like that you can jump over it and oftentimes as well after he does the uh the flying attack he will do a tail attack if you are close enough but when he gets about a quarter Health he'll actually do two tail attacks one of which has a very long range so keep that in mind when you are uh fighting against him in these moments it has very long range and it will hit you from pretty far away I'll try to show that to you guys as well all right there's the attack we attack once and then we Dodge it's a slow fight it's laboring but it's very possible to do it without uh without dying and without parrying the same stuff will apply to casting spells and using arrows all right there's that big tail attack like I said we got him to do it he can hit me from the other side of the rock that's how far range it is you need to make sure that you're ready to dodge twice when he does that another tail we attack once we back off another tail here's a jump you should tail attack again oh he did not [Music] that attack right there is a moment to get a pretty free double attack in if you're able to time that well I do not recommend it as it is a little bit more risky but it is something you can still pull off if you choose to and then when he does the double tail attack here you can actually get two in it two attacks in without much uh without much risk so if you're able to pull that off that's something I would recommend as well but again that's a more advanced tip so be aware of the risk you're taking with it there it is another post tail attack we back off here comes the lunge here comes the tail we attack again we back up very safe very clean another uh lunge attack with the wings we Dodge here comes the double tail we strike them twice we roll We Roll we strike We Roll very clean just assume that all of his attacks will have its hail coming out afterward even if he doesn't actually do it it's best to assume that he will for the sake of keeping your health up you don't want him to hit you with it because it's not small amounts of damage you saw what damage it did to me earlier you want to avoid that whenever possible attack twice we roll We Roll We Roll roll attack Here Comes tail attack so it is completely possible to take out a crucible Knight with nothing but dodging you don't have to worry about parrying I'm just going to squash that rumor right here right now you do not have to Parry to get through this fight there's plenty of opportunity to land melee attacks with nothing but dodging you just have to time it properly with that said guys I hope this Crucible night fight guide does help you out this is applicable to every Crucible Knight that uses a sword and shield this is not applicable to the ones with the spears so keep that in mind but that is strictly just the sword and shield variant including ordovus himself anyways I'm out of here for now guys I hope this video helps you thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

Transcript Text:
hey guys welcome to my channel for another eldering boss guy this time we're going to talk about I call them boat necromancers they're they're basically necromancers inside of boats but they are technically called tibia Mariners now when you first walk up to them they will teleport and then start rowing around with their horn slash ore you can just kind of stay on your horse back and just keep slicing at them with whatever your weapon is when you start to see him cast a spell or move his uh his uh horn in an aggressive way you want to back off because he does a lot of stuff with magical water or magic induced water where he basically just splashes it around you'll see that he like he had like the wave attack he's got the splash attack he'll even go as far as throwing going to throw water at you with the ore he also has a couple attacks where he'll actually blow into the horn there's one attack specifically that'll actually help you out in a big way the first one is the horn will glow red and when he does that it will summon some skeletons in the area around you now when he does that you want to make sure that you're able to avoid the skeletons if you need to stop for a moment to take out the skeletons that is okay there's nothing wrong with that in fact in that moment I would recommend that you do so so that way you're not getting hit by a bunch of different sources all at the same time it can do surprising amounts of damage so that's the one I'm talking about where it's glowing red you now see skeletons rising out of the water that's why I call them the boat necromancer he has another attack as well where he blows into the horn but instead of the glowing red it'll have like a blackish gray glow when it does that I mean it's gonna do a giant AOE attack this one right here what you want to do is walk up and hit him when you do so it does a huge AOE shock wave that damages him and all the skeletons around him which is very very important for damage all around you can also see that the boat Necromancer or the tibia Mariner will actually be able to do Splash damage against his own summons so what we want to do is just kind of let that happen walk away and then we'll come back and keep slicing them up this one specifically is the very first one in the game so it's not very difficult at all and once it's dead it's dead all the all the all the summons will die at the same time so you don't have to worry about it and every single one of them in the game will drop you a death route which is important if you're going for the special incantations or weapons that you can get from garank you'll all sometimes they'll also give like special spells or uh summons like this and so if you're into like death Magics or you know Undead based ashes of War you want to make sure that you're taking these these guys out they're very they're very easy but can be very rewarding if you're going for that specific play style anyways guys thank you for tuning in for another Elden ring boss guide this time for the tibia Mariner I hope this video helps you make sure you leave a like and a comment and subscribe to the channel and I'll see you guys soon for more

Video ID: vJMSragAHe4
Transcript Text:
hey guys welcome to the channel for another Elden ring boss guide this time we're taking on the demi-human chief Duo that you can find down here at the coastal cave in Lim grave now there is a way to make it so you can fight one at a time and I am going to attempt doing that here as long as you keep the first one closer to the door that we're at right now it might be it might be possible to just fight one at a time generally the second one will come out if you'd go too far into the cave or if you take too long to kill the first one so we're gonna try this out and see how it goes either way we will get through this and I'm going to teach you my tactics as to how the biggest thing that I like to do is just focus on the chief itself I basically ignore all the smaller demi-humans because the chief realistically is the only one that'll constantly attack you the smaller ones will attack you sometimes but most of the time they just kind of stand there and scream at you like little little screamers I don't know how else to say it little screamers so they just yell at you a lot and allows you to kind of focus on fighting the chiefs with that said let's get started the first one is over here to the left so it's gonna run right over there and get some big attacks on it unfortunately the other one did hear the screams already so let's try to finish this one as fast as possible what you want to do is uh just kind of be aware that the demiq and Chiefs will swing Non-Stop so you want to make sure that you take down the first one as fast as possible now you can see that these weapons dominated him in a very quick fashion so we're able to take him down without much effort where's the other one oh the other one actually didn't come out it just shows the health bar you can see the other one hiding over there in the cave you see him over there so let's go ahead and clear out the rest of these smaller guys here and I'll really focus on talking about the tactics of how I fight them individually with this next one you could see by the first one we took out they do a lot of jumping and stabbing so basically you just want to make sure that you avoid these attacks because they can kind of stagger you easily I like to just kind of roll through some of their basic attacks counter-attack them really quick do a quick roll hit him with a jump attack so it staggers them the good news about these guys is they in fact they are very easy to stagger even with very light weapon rate so as long as you're getting those staggers on them you'll be able to run in hit them and then back off and then avoid their uh their little flourish attacks their spin attacks their screams whatever it is that they're doing to you you can see that they're pretty basic to avoid the big thing is just making sure that you can fight one at a time if you can pull off one at a time they're really not bad as you can see they're both dead the problem is solved and then you get the tailoring tools and the sewing needle which you can use to give to Bach for his quest if you're doing it and also another thing to mention is when you do kill off the Chiefs the rest of these guys will pretty much stop attacking you they'll just stand there and like they look like they're surrendering if you do kill them Unfortunately they do not give you runes after the fight so that's a little bit of a sadness but either way the the demi-human Chiefs aren't really all that bad if you can pull them off one at a time like I did if you just kind of jump into the room and immediately cut left you can focus down the first one extremely quickly even with basic Weaponry you can see that my sham sure is only plus one and my Scimitar is plus two by this point in the game if you're fighting these you can make your Weaponry even stronger than this so you don't have to really fret about the actual damage you're putting out because these are very basic with that said guys I'm out of here for now I hope this guide helps you thank you guys for tuning in thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

Title: How To Defeat Erdtree Avatar - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: FmJDxgV0FV0
Transcript Text:
hey guys welcome to the channel for another boss guide in Elden ring this time talking about ERD tree Avatar there are two different variants of the earth tree Avatar but I am talking about the the normal one here that you can find down in Weeping Peninsula this is likely the first one that you will find in front of the minor Earth tree down here there are many of these throughout the game so this same strategy is going to be applicable to all of them my first bit of advice would be to bring fire weapons and spells or Frost magic and weapons um either way Frost and fire both highly effective but they're most effective if you couple them together because when you frostbite them you can instantly use fire to reset the frost and then hit them with the frost again if you only have fire they're actually taking extra damage from fire because they are made of wood so they take extra damage from it keep in mind when it is raining like it is in game right now your fire spells will do 10 less damage but that's not really a big deal because they're already pretty weak to it now I will not be using Frost or fire in this fight I'm just using a couple scimitars with lead on them but they're immune to bleed so that does not matter the big attack that you need to watch out for when it comes to the archery avatars is when they slam the head of their staff into the ground and you'll see a bunch of holy missiles spawn and then they'll send themselves at you what you want to do there in that moment is when you see the head of the staff going to the ground you want to run away put some distance between you and the Earth tree Avatar and then run at a 90 degree angle and when you're sprinting at a 90 degree angle these holy missiles will not hit you and you don't have to worry about the actual archery Avatar hitting you himself with that said let's get started you can very much so easily Dodge these very basic ground slams and uh these heavy attacks from the staff they're pretty basic to dodge if you know how to dodge in this game whatsoever then you can handle this as well make sure that you're not expending all of your stamina at once though I would say to keep things safe you want to make sure you keep at least one quarter of your total stamina so that way you can have enough time to dodge or run if you need to anything like that it's very important to have stamina when whenever there's a panic moment an archery avatars can create quite a few Panic moments when it comes to uh specifically this spell right here so you can see that I'm running away from them when he slams the head of the staff into the ground and then I run at a 90 degree angle you see how I'm not even dodging but they're still missing if you do that right you'll never have to actually worry about that and then when you're getting close you just kind of do your thing again I did get hit by the stomp because I got greedy in the moment but that's okay that's all right we're just doing our thing again as long as you keep some stamina available so that way you can dodge the uh this attack right here you'll be good to go you'll have nothing to worry about run at a 90 degree angle and they all Miss and then we getting close again Dodge at the last second so the melee weapon doesn't hit you Dodge so the role or the stomp doesn't hit you dodge shows us the body slammed up can't you and you're good to go let's let our stamina go up there's bats run at a 90 degree angle we're good to go you do hit it fast enough and enough you'll be able to get a critical hit here after the Stagger and then boom archery Avatar down now again this strategy is applicable to every single archery Avatar in the game including the putrid ones but the putrid ones have a couple special attacks that we'll talk about in that video later on with that said I'm out of here for now I hope this video helps you thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you guys soon for more

Title: How To Defeat Ancient Hero of Zamor - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: CBwWeqUKUB8
Transcript Text:
hey everyone welcome to the channel for another eldering boss guide this time we're taking on an ancient hero of zamor that you can find at the Weeping ever jail down here in Weeping Peninsula likely the third ever jail you'll come across in this game it does require one stone sword key to activate so make sure that you have one available the ancient hero of xamore features a lot of frost attacks and you can get frostbitten so you need to be very very careful this uh this boss as well has a lot of fluidity in its movement so you need to make sure that you're choosing the right moments to attack as well as the right moments to counter attack there's not a whole lot of things to say other than to just watch closely Because the actual embellishment of the attacks that the ancient Heroes zamor has can make it very confusing to find the right moments to go in you can Parry the ancient hero of xamar as well but I generally only wait for one specific one during phase two where it does a pretty long distance lunge at you that's incredibly easy to dodge so I'm gonna try to show that in this video I hope I don't miss it and make myself look bad but if I do it is what it is anyways just like every other ever jail you can land a couple of attacks for free right at the very beginning when it spawns don't be afraid to swing away here we go there we go easy 300 damage now this fight is a bit of a dance because the ancient hero of zamor will do a lot of fluid movements like I said whenever it does that uh frost breath attack make sure you run up and hit it once because it's pretty free as you can see the attacks are already kind of crazy there's a lot of double and triple Swings with this boss so be ready to dodge like crazy in those moments you're gonna need two or three Dodges for a lot of these combos like that right there and that right there uh a lot of these attacks are luckily horizontal though so you don't have to worry about a whole lot of vertical stuff let's walk up hit it the guy hit once ourselves but that's okay oh not okay now we're taking a lot of damage now when it does this little kneeling thing it does mean it's entering phase two when it is transforming you can run up and hit it a few times for free if you do stagger it at the right time as well you'll be able to uh reset the animation make him do it again that's the lunging attack that I mentioned that is very easily periable don't be afraid to hit it in that moment and then be make sure you do hit it when it stands back up again as well Here Comes This you wanted to run in hit it again back up watch out for the AOE Frost attack there comes the lunge again nope you did lunge okay here's another winter storm type attack another little blizzard now when it does the AOE blizzard around you it'll often do the ice wave attack afterward your best bet is just kind of Run and Jump to the side not a whole lot you can do about that otherwise got hit by the other Appel there let's heal up [Music] he though that the movement is very much so like uh it reminds me of the dancer from Dark Souls 3. here's the parable attack very easy to Parry it just hit L2 as soon as it's in front of you and he hit it for free and then when it stands up hit it with a free heavy unlike myself I missed and then finish it off again the biggest thing about the ancient hero xamore that gets a lot of people is just the incredible fluidity and movement that it features it makes it very difficult because it just it's dancing all over the place it's doing two or three hit combos that are very difficult to time the Dodges on and so you just want to make sure that you're capitalizing on the right moments when it's casting it's Frost spell like the frost wave that is its weakest moment to attack in its second weakest moment is when it's doing the uh the lunge attack that's very easy to Parry it did it twice in that fight you can see that it's pretty easy to time so if you know how to Parry at all I would recommend doing it in that moment but if you're not able to Parry you can still counter-attack after that lunge when it does the lunge it'll generally just kind of give itself a moment to stand back up you can hit it for free after a Dodge anyways guys I hope this video helps you thank you so much for tuning in and watching uh thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

hey guys welcome to the channel for another Elden ring boss guide this time we're talking about the scaly must begotten that you can find in morne tunnel down in Weeping peninsula in this tunnel there's a whole bunch of smithing Stone so it's a really good place to go to get early early game weapon upgrades but the scaly must begotten has some pretty delayed attacks that can cause a lot of issues for people when it comes to dodging so I'm gonna see if I can do this without getting hit too much but I will say that I struggle with this type of enemy even the non-boss type variants just because the way it swings the ax you can tell by the size of the ax that it has a massive amount of range so basically you want to try to wait until that last second to dodge but also you need to you need to realize that it will do two to three swings and then it'll start doing weird jump attacks like that the jump attacks aren't too bad to dodge right they're not too bad so if you want to you can actually just maintain your distance wait until it swings the ax twice run in and hit it but watch out for that third strike that it does sometimes like that right there you see how much range it's getting it's actually almost hitting me this far away that's quite the range to it luckily it doesn't have a whole lot of attacks to it otherwise you could you saw the uh the third hit that it can do in some of these combos outside of that it does have another jump attack where It'll like it'll roll at you and then spring up but that one's pretty easy to get out of the way of you see you mean by the by the delayed attack though where it's just so easy to get hit by it it holds the uh the stance for so long and then suddenly swings out of nowhere it's really hard to not get hit by it so my recommendation is to just play it patience try to stay out of range and then run in for an attack after that swing you can see there's the jump attack with the ground slam and then the roll the roll there luckily doesn't do a whole lot of damage so we have that on our side and then from there you just kind of slowly poke it down and take care of business it does drop the Rusted anchor which is a pretty cool weapon it does both it does Pierce damage not no I was gonna say it does Pierce and um strike but it's actually only pierce oddly enough despite being a giant club which is pretty interesting anyways guys thank you for tuning in for another boss guide that was a scaly must begotten be aware of those delayed attacks just keep your distance and then run into strike for some easy damage and then just play it safe I'm out of here for now thank you all for watching this video and thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

hey everyone welcome back to the channel for another Elder ring boss guide this time we're talking about the death birds that you can find throughout the lands between there is one right here in Weeping Peninsula which we'll be using as an example for this boss guide but you can find Death birds and death right birds all over the lands between this video specifically covers the death birds as they are a little bit lesser than the death right Birds the death ripe birds have some unique ghost flame animations and attacks going on where the death birds do not they're just strictly melee with that said let's get started on the fights I did try another take of this and I rolled a little bit early and got insta killed by him so we're gonna try this again there are some bats in the area so we need to be careful about that a lot of people like to fight this from horseback but I do not I prefer to fight it on foot the big Focus if you can make it happen is you want to try to hit the death birds in the head if you can hit them in the head you can knock them down a lot faster plus do a little bit of extra damage so that's why I like to focus on just doing a lot of jumping attacks against the skull of the death bird you'll see here that I'm just kind of doing a lot of jumping attacks just focusing on trying to not get hit by him as much as possible the big thing you need to watch out for is that jumping attack right there that is its single most damaging attack if you can dodge that you'll generally be okay I would say overall though the hardest thing about this fight is probably the camera because you can see I'm locked onto the head here but you can also Target the main body like so you can change the Target by using the right analog stick here I like to Target its head like I said so we're gonna keep on doing that and hope that we don't get killed there's that slam again when you are underneath it you'll see that it will try to Peck you with its beak if you do see it starting to pack you need to get out from underneath it outside of that I prefer to stay underneath them for the majority of the fight as it allows a lot of the attacks to just simply miss you to get in do another jump attack don't roll early like I did just stay alive and also enjoy the music the music for the death Birds is really great I really enjoy it you see though uh how I'm just focusing on hitting the head in between its own attacks just rolling out of the the range of all these attacks as well as the pecs and just Landing those jump attacks where possible the death bird does have some pretty good Mobility as you're seeing for a larger enemy the good news is though is as long as you know the timing of the Dodge it gets better and better with time here comes a swing plan that jump oh it hit the slam but the damage did not apply it was only the actual AOE now that right there that lunge is a command grab you see this you see that command grab I just did it twice in a row that I was waiting for that to happen whenever you see the death bird scream you need to make sure you're ready to dodge there's about a 50 50 chance that if it does scream that it will do that specific command grab attack if it does grab you it will do absolutely massive damage and there's nothing you can do about it if it does grab you once it grabs you the damage is applied and there's nothing else that can go on right here so basically once it screams wait a second and then roll as long as you roll at the right time it will not hit you outside of that the rest of the fight is pretty basic for these death birds you can see I'm kind of toying with it at this point just because I know the Dodge timing I'm trying to show everyone the right moment to dodge all these attacks as much as possible let's go ahead and uh finish this up now shall we GG that's our first deaf bird of the game as long as you watch out for the ground slams and that command grab with its beak overall the fight won't be too bad you do get the sacrificial ax with this which is actually a really interesting ax because every time you kill an enemy with it or an enemy dies around you you regain 4 FP or Mana the blue bar so if you're a spellcaster this ax might be a pretty good main weapon for you anyways guys I hope this video helps you thank you so much for leaving a like comment and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

Title: How To Defeat Margit, The Fell Omen - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: EeUP-ASNY8Q
Transcript Text:
hey guys welcome to the channel for another boss guide of Elden ring this time we're taking on Margaret the fell Omen this boss is a major test of player patience and skill and so I'm hoping that this video can help you out I'm going to talk about a few different ways that you can take on markets specifically with focusing on dodging and then another focus on potential parrying now if you are a spellcaster you can cast your spells like crazy in this fight just be aware that market will become hyper aggressive if you do so so while that is commonplace for Elden ring when you do cast spells or shoot arrows at enemies it makes them more aggressive just be aware that Margaret the fellowman is not excused from that idea if you try to cast spells on him he will just rush you like crazy so be aware of that first thing I want to talk about is right here you do have a summon his name is Roger he's also a uh he's a spellblade type he's got a sword uh and a uh I think it's an esthetic and then he casts spells as well if you do need help he's a good a good little bit of help in the fights as well as you can summon your own ashes during this area too if you do have access to that already at this point in the game so let's get this fight started you just run up to the gate here and then you see this cut scene I'm gonna let the cutscene play out [Music] emboldened by the flame of ambition foreign all right so the first thing I'm going to talk about is how to Parry Margaret the fellow men he does have a couple of very periable facts so let's talk about which ones are not this one you cannot Parry any jumping attacks in the game so don't try that he'll have a this attack right here he he'll charge his weapon when he does that he's gonna swing at you twice basically you want to roll around the back of him if you try to roll away from when he does that you'll find that his Cane has extremely long range and will likely hit you because of the actual hitbox size of it so be aware of that I'll swinging him to Perry so that attack right there that just missed the perion it is it is very periable but I parried a little bit late a lot of his overhand attacks that he'll do are very periable and if you are parrying those are the ones you want to focus on he does do a little bit of a scoop attack right here and then follows it up with the slam that slam is the one you want to try to Parry and then that backhand attack is also periable but keep in mind that in order to uh in order to actually get her a pause on him you have to Parry twice it does save so once you get the second one it'll it will work out but you will not be able to get a repost until that secondary specifically so be aware of that let's see if we can get this to work here it is I buried late again there's the scoop here's the slam and there's our repost so I wouldn't recommend actually parrying him this is something that if you if you really want to challenge yourself for this fight that is a way to fight him but I would recommend just sticking to dodging as because he does take two parries to get a repost on unless you're using daggers it's just not really worth the effort so we're gonna fight him normally by dodging now you'll see that he has a couple of slower attacks one where he jumps up in the air and then slams the ground with the staff and then another one where he just slowly raises the weapon like he just did and then stabs the ground with the staff those are the best moments to strike if he does that those are your moments where you want to swing your weapon as much as possible without being greedy so we're gonna try to lure that out of them again so I can show you what I mean this right here he does this we can attack twice and then back off for safe for free we're not taking any damage slow and steady wins this race let's back up here's the slam you can attack him there with that too but I will say that uh it's it's likely best to just kind of not if you're a little bit if you're unable to time it well let's go ahead and try to get more of these slam attacks out [Music] Here Comes one right here oh I lied that's not right there he changed it up on me here it is right here once he stabs it in the ground he can land two or three quick attacks and then roll away you see how much damage I was able to land there without much effort those are the attacks you want to capitalize your damage on because he's unable to move so you can just hit him for free here's this attack again we Dodge around the side of him for both of these attacks and swing once we back off once he goes phase two he pulls out a faith Spirit hammer and then slams the ground with it this is when the fight gets real these weapons are unparriable and can also be very hard to dodge based on the combos that he pulls off with them the same rule applies though same rule applies with the staff when he stabs the staff into the ground you can hit him two or three times then back off and take minimal damage and so that's what I'm going to keep on doing to really show how much you can take advantage of that moment you can also hit him once or twice for free after he uh does the jump attack with a hammer but you need to be careful because if you time it poorly like I just did he will hit you with a follow-up attack which is just it's just devastating thank you can also follow up behind them like that if you're uh if you feel comfortable with that attack right there so you need a couple of free hits in here's this attack them three times we back off see this is the way you want to take advantage of moments where he stabs the staff into the ground that is when he is at his weakest and most free to take damage in the meantime enjoy the music as well the music of this fight is pretty great I could have attacked him once there but I wasn't close enough to capitalize on it so I didn't get greedy this fight is all about the endurance and patience and like I said before this fight is going to be a litmus for the rest of the game for you so if you can get through this fight you'll be able to make it through the rest of the main bosses of this game it's very important that you just practice your patience don't be greedy take advantage of his weakest moment right there and just do it again on repeat again we get behind them we swing we back up free and easy and now we go for the Finish one more time he does it it's game over now keep in mind that you can do this with summons again as well but that's something that it does change the dynamic of the fight because he'll actually change the targeting and it will change up his actual combos if he's able to remain close range to an enemy and there we go when you defeat him you get a Talisman pouch which means you can equip a second Talisman which is a huge which is a huge upgrade for your character you can equip another Talisman and become that much stronger and then you're free to play the rest of the game you can move on into Stormville Castle which is one of the best areas in the entire game so much to explore so much to do it's exhilarating thank you for watching this video I hope it helps you get through Market the fellowman thank you for tuning in for it thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

Title: How To Defeat Godrick The Grafted - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: 2JBUiheiXJA
Transcript Text:
hey folks thank you for tuning in for another eldering boss guide this time we're talking about godric the grafted or the golden whatever the hell his name is the man with a million limbs that's what I like to call him he has a big ax that causes earthquakes and stuff like that he's actually a pretty cool fight one of the better ones in the game if you ask me now for this fight you do have the capability of summoning nepheli Lou if you speak to her in a room just to the South just to the south of this path here you'll find her standing over the body of a banished Knight if you speak to her there and exhaust her dialogue she'll be able to spawn here and help you out with the fight if you so choose now I'm gonna let the um the cutscene play so everyone can watch it is pretty cool and then we're going to discuss the tactics and how I defeat Mr godrick let's do this oh Kindred deliver me unto foreign I am the Lord of all that is golden all right let's do this thing now the first thing we need to talk about with godric he does have some pretty crazy combos as well as some good range so this fight is another one that's all about patience and dodging at the right time he'll drag his ax causing a bunch of Sparks and then he tries to uppercut you with it he'll jump attack like so that one's very easy to dodge but generally speaking he has a couple of combos in the first phase where you can really capitalize on making a window of opportunity to land some good attacks when you see the Whirlwind go around them make sure you maintain your distance from there when he does the Whirlwind he will pull off one of two attacks one he'll roll and then jump up in the air and do a slam the other one who actually sends some wind at you you'll have to make sure that you dodge to the side or you know through it in general to make sure it doesn't hit you this is the same attack I'm talking about right here this one he's rolling he's jumping We Roll we attack twice and then we back off very safe very effective turn on the music a little bit there sorry about that he can lunge you like this I meant to dodge that I'm trying to get him to do the other Whirlwind attack so let's see if we can pull that out of him before we go phase two okay here's a whirlwind and then he'll swoosh and then swoosh keep in mind that the first one will go a little bit curved and that's why I got hit by it I forgot about the curved aspect but that is both Whirlwind attacks here's his main combo as well where he swings like crazy at you I think it's total of six swings five or six swings right there you can actually capitalize on the moment from the last swing as well to dodge towards him and be able to land a couple of pretty big hits and then of course he has his earthquake attack during phase one he'll do it twice and during phase two he does it three times in phase one I like to wait for him to do the first earthquake and then jump time or time to jump to where I'm in the air over the second part of the earthquake and then allow myself to get a big jump attack against him here's the roll the smash the free double attack we back off slams The Ground we attack again we back off again because Here Comes This Big combo I'll show you what I mean by b trying to get close to him you can time this here so that we can land another couple attacks for free that is a possibility as well um I like to do it just because it's you know it's a pretty easy window to understand because I've done this so many times but if you are newer to the game I would say take your time be a little more patient try not to rush too many attacks and just learn what he can do and learn to dodge time or you know time your Dodges more effectively you land those attacks now I'm going to show you what I mean by jumping his earthquake I'm gonna wait until he does the earthquake before going phase two so I can show you what he what I mean what you want to do is when he does the first earthquake is back off and then jump when he's about to do the second one I'll show you what I mean hopefully here do it here it comes there's the first one I know we go in we jump we attack and then there you go now when he goes phase two he actually chops off his own arm you'll be able to watch the animation here where he basically plugs his arm into a dragon and gets a dragon hand I think of the old Glade plugins every time he does this plug it in plug it in and then all of a sudden you have a dragon hand it's pretty neat I wish I could do that truest of dragons now right away in phase two he's going to spray dragon breath at you and it has a very good range what I like to do is once phase two starts I Sprint at him immediately because if you get close range the fire can't hit you because his arm passes over you which gives you a good opportunity to land it released three attacks which is pretty massive I'll show you what I mean once the cutscene ends just Sprint at him and you'll get right underneath him and he can't hit you [Music] see what I mean that's very big damage for free now you just want to make sure you maintain your distance watch for what a taxi is going to use he has three different fire breath attacks with the dragon hand he just pulled off the second one or I should say four sorry this one here is just an extension of what his F his Whirlwind attack from the first part this time it just has extra fire on it the other a dragon fire attack is this one right here where he just does the uh the horizontal spray you can land a good three or four hits there and then the other one is he does like the mid-range mortar type attack where he just kind of sprays Fireballs everywhere and then he has another one where he basically sprays the fire in a straight line right here this is the one I'm talking about this one has insane range and is very difficult to Dodge in fact I'll likely get hit by a ear because of the range I got very lucky and somehow didn't get hit but I'll give him some more opportunity to use more of his Dragon spells so you can kind of see what I mean like an extension of his first phase Whirlwind including the fire of the Dragon this time there's the horizontal Dragon spray very easy to land a lot of attacks on that one let's even get him to do the mid-range one here it is you can see it's like a mourner where it's just a bunch of little fireballs going everywhere causing Splash damage and then he has the uh this one right here perfect whereas basically just a very long range Flame just want to back way up from that one because if you get too close it just it just hurts you knocks you down and can cause unreal damage early on in the game with that said let's finish off the fights now that we have seen his entire move set also I will say as well for his earthquake during phase two your best bet is just completely avoid him you can time the jump as well on the third one but I consider it not worth it because it's extra delayed and it can cause a lot of timing issues for for people that might not be able to time to sew out like myself from there we just go up we hit him a bunch we really capitalize on those moments where he's at his weakest his most vulnerable and we defeat godric the grafted now when you do defeat him you get access to your first great room so make sure that you can activate that alongside with some Rune arcs you can go to uh the tower over in the Southeastern side of Stormville Castle to activate it and then use your Rune arcs to make it so you get basically 40 levels of free stats from activating it and with that said guys I'm out of here for now thank you so much for watching the video on godric the graph that I hope it helps you thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

Title: How To Defeat Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: 5Lm1KCjxeoY
Transcript Text:
hey everyone welcome to another Elden ring boss guide this time we're fighting ranala Queen of the moon or queen of the full moon or whatever her name is ranala the generally speaking it's Mo it's the second great boss the great Rune boss or remembrance boss rather that you will fight an Elden ring we are here for the first time on this character specifically I'm using curved swords with bleed on them we're going to talk about the best moments to attack and what attacks you need to look out for that deal the most damage with that said let's get started now there is a cutscene here and I am going to talk over it to give you a premise of how you do this very first phase as ranala is a two-phase fight during the first phase ranala is going to be floating around in the center of the main room and there's going to be a bunch of uh children crawling around in their robes when you are walking around amongst all these children you'll see that one of them specifically has a golden glowing Aura to them you need to attack that one specifically in order to remove that aura to break the spell that's protecting ranala you need to do that three times in order to knock her down to the ground and then when you do that it'll give you a few moments to attack her to lower her health and then she'll bring that Shield back up after a short explosion and then you have to repeat that cycle until all of her health is gone you do need to be careful as the kids on the ground will be throwing Magic books at you as well as trying to grab your ankles and using flame attacks so make sure you are careful when you're running around during that moment so you don't take too much damage um also you'll know which one has the glowing Aura as you'll be able to hear them it'll give you a bit of a directional cue I got very lucky and this first one was right next to me notice how I attacked it but I did not need to kill it to break that that aura on it here's some of these books we Dodge the books we attack and we go for the next one if you listen closely the game will tell you the direction of the next one by the singing whichever kid is singing is the one that has the aura so if you're having a hard time finding it that's what you need to pay attention for [Music] and now that we've broke her Shield she's down on the ground we can attack her let's get more stamina going we attack again we got her to about 1 3 HP on the very first go there it might take you a few times depending on your build but you just basically repeat that same cycle now you want to make sure that you do it quickly because after you knock her down for the first time if you don't do it quick enough again she'll actually take a bunch of the kids and throw them at you yes I'm not kidding when I say this she picks up a bunch of these kids and throws them at you like they're rocks I'm not exaggerating that's exactly what happens you need to make sure that you knock her down quickly so that doesn't happen it's kind of terrifying all right first phase Ronaldo Queen of the full moon is down and now we go on to the more difficult Parts okay this is the part that a lot of people struggle on during the second phase Ronaldo will open up by casting commodizor at you she will charge it but if you time it right you can actually get right next to her and land a couple of attacks for free and I'm going to show you exactly how I do that her next big attack that she does is she curls up into a small floating ball turns into a full moon and then throws the full moon wow sorry for the stutter Rose the full moon at you you need to make sure that when you went to the full Moon's coming at you that you dodge it because it does massive damage to you and will basically end the fight most of the time so you need to make sure you avoid that damage the third thing that she does is she can do summons she can summon a dragon she can summon wolves she can summon a bloodhound uh Bloodhound Knights and she can summon a giant troll the only one you really have to worry about is the for me personally I've only ever struggled with the Wolves as the dragon the troll and the Bloodhound Knight go away pretty quickly and you can most of the time just ignore them in fact that's what I recommend you do just run away from them until they go away our next attack that she can do is basically a bunch of different Glenstone style of attack she's got Glenstone Comet she's got Glenstone shards she's got uh Pebbles you just need to make sure that you're dodging them all in the right way and you will see during this fight how I dodge them there she is Ronaldo and then she also has the uh spinning blade attack so if you're standing next to her for too long then she will often spin her her staff in front of you which will do a lot of damage and then she will also be able to throw it at you which can do a lot of damage too so you need to be careful of that okay so here's some of these uh Glenstone spells that I mentioned you need to just kind of Dodge around them there's the spinning blade attack the good news about this fight is that she has very low Poise which means every time you hit her you can interrupt her as you can see here it'll actually interrupt her in the middle of her spells which is pretty important to know there's comets all right now she's gonna start summoning here's the dragon now you'll see that the dragon's not really a problem it's actually kind of weird the dragon will blow fire at you you can just back away and then it'll try to fly at you but if you're far enough away already it can't hurt you you see it just lands short and then it goes away it's very easy to dodge and now she's going to be taking care of us with the Giants the giant will do some ground pounding some stomping some running at you but you can just kind of run away from it and not have to worry too much you see what I mean I'm just kind of running away just basically ignoring him like he doesn't exist you just kind of take your time try to get close to Ronaldo as much as you can land your attacks and repeat that cycle the Wolves can be problematic as I they often last the longest as far as summons go but as long as you're running away and getting closer to ranawa attacking and then rolling as you can they generally don't have a whole lot of opportunity to hit you so as you can see and that's pretty much it for the fight I'm surprised she hasn't done the whole film full moon thing yet but a lot of people find the issue with the summons but if you do it right you don't have to really worry about the summons too much [Music] as you can see as long as you can just pace yourself understand that there's more of a bullet hell fight than anything else you're able to kind of get close stagger her take your time back off recover your stamina and go in again the biggest issue that people have is they get desperate they try to run in and stay close all the time you need to let ranala have her distance just like a relationship if someone feels that they need their space give them their space right we've all been there right if you give her her space and recover your stamina you're able to go in and do a lot more over time and so that is what I recommend for this fight take your time pace yourself give her her space and then attack with that said I'm out here for now thank you all for joining me for another boss guide for Elden Elden ring this time taking on ranala Queen of the full moon I hope this video helps you thank you for liking

Title: How To Defeat Starscourge Radahn - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: XRgvzXEBIoI
Transcript Text:
hey guys welcome to another Elden ring boss guide video this time we're talking about radon radon is a pretty feared boss in Eldon ring a lot of people see the size of him his swords and his movesets and they just kind of they have a really hard time fighting him and I will admit that he can be tough for for both new players and old players if you have if you just don't know how to really tackle his moves so what I'm gonna do is discuss how to open up the fights and then my choice in kind of tackling him I will be doing this with no summons even though there's a bunch of summons on the battlefield and I am using Frost and bleed on my weapons now I do recommend that you use some type of Elemental stuff against him so that way you can burst him down faster I think everything in the game affects him everything from frost to bleed to Scarlet raw and poison across the board can take him out I do recommend using something there though if you do want to take him down without it that is cool too you can use heavy weaponry and light Weaponry anything across the board magic you can do whatever you want but my tactic is to use Frost and believe need on fast-winging weapons to build it up as quickly as possible and we just try to stay underneath them as much as we can with that said let's get started what I like to do at the beginning of this and I don't know if this still works I don't know if they patched this out or not what I like to do is once I load in I walk away from radon while he's firing his arrows at me you want to make sure that you roll at the right time but once you see his actual body disappear you can start running towards him again you'll see that he'll fire an arrow off in the distance either to the left or the right and then pull out his swords and immediately charge you that's the easier way to just kind of get him to fight you and I do recommend doing that so that way you don't have to deal with all the arrows from his bow now what he'll likely do is he'll do a big ground attack where he'll just like crawl around and just start swinging his weapons at you like so and while you're underneath him you can just swing away now it is going to take some time for a lot of players to understand like the pattern of his swings and there's really not much I can do to describe how to dodge it aside from just practice there's nothing wrong with getting hit by his weapons I mean I'm still getting hit now and I would recommend just taking time to practice and don't be afraid of dying but anyways if you can get underneath them even when you're swinging his weapons you can just land so much damage so quickly make sure you're avoiding his uh ground slam there so you're not getting hit for free and even when he is charging up his spell to leave you can hit him a punch as you can see I got him all the way down to about a third of his health before he even jumped away because of the frost and bleed now during phase two he jumps away and then comes in like a wrecking ball here a literal asteroid when he lands you can just jump at him and just start swinging away you want to make sure that you're not getting hit by a sword so do the same dodging patterns you did before just be aware that he does have a couple of extra moves on his hands now because he's in phase two they will involve a lot of gravity magic you'll see him pull rocks out of the ground there and he will sling these rocks at you before too long specifically when he gets lower Health you'll see him run away and then he'll just throw them at you let's see if we can get him we'll get him to throw the rocks at me and then he'll start going all crazy I'm just gonna avoid him for a minute until he does this Joe's gonna avoid him because I'm actually killing him far too fast oh make sure that you roll that at the very last second if he sends the wave at you okay here comes the Rocks he's gonna throw the rocks on the left and then the rocks on the right you want to dodge and then Dodge and then he's gonna jump at you you need to dodge at the very last second and then you get a quick moment to attack him in return and then he flies up in the air and Spins at you and then he turns around and Spins at you again he needs a Dodge at the very last second in order to not get hit by that you want to hold as long as possible literally do not Dodge until the purple is in your face and that is the way to dodge it if you dodge too early or too late it will hit you and the curve to it will actually throw you for a loop every single time until you get used to it so don't be afraid if you get hit by it don't be afraid to practice it and just let it happen Keep Calm Dodge accurately and finish him off with that said guys I'm out of here for now thank you so much for watching my radon my radon boss guide I hope this video helps you thank you so much for tuning in thank you for leaving a like a comment and subscribing and I'll see you next time

hey everyone welcome back to another boss guide in Elden ring this time we're taking on the Knox swordstress and the Knox priest that you can find here in the Celia town of sorcery after you activate a bunch of fires in some Towers nearby it'll unlock this door as well as several other doors nearby allowing you to fight a boss here now the basic strategy to this to this boss is there are two of them so you want to focus one at a time if possible so what I'm going to do is basically just take on what everyone gets closest to me and deal with them as quickly as I can now their attacks are not payable because their weapons are weird they're very fluid they're liquid they're almost like whips that guy has a club and this lady over here has a curved sword as you can see they kind of play like whips a little bit so it makes them a little bit weird to fight as they are very good from close and mid-range so we are going to focus on the swordstress first as she's the one that attacked us first and now that we have her cornered we're able to just kind of get in there and beat you're up as you can see she has very low Poise both of them have low Poise which allows you to basically just interrupt their attacks constantly the main key here is to run in on them and hit them with a running attack whenever you're able to get in there between their own combos so you want to run close get them to attack a couple times and then when their combo is done you'll be able to go in and land your damage you need to be aware that the other guy will hit you a lot of people think that uh Duo bosses like this will basically take turns fighting you when they actually change that not too long ago and one of the more recent patches you want to be very careful as they can surprise you with the amount of damage they can do as there are two of them well you can see I'm just running in here in between their attacks and able to just land my own and finish them off don't be afraid if you do take some hits here and there as you're trying to get in there close as that's just kind of the way it is but Duo bosses like this now now that we killed the first one the second one is pretty much the same premise but you don't have to worry about any outside sources of damage so get them to do their combos get in land your damage and move on from there if you are able to find a way to Corner them even better yet as you're able to basically just trap them there and repeat your damage over and over again as you can see here we've got this guy basically cornered now so I'm able to really dominate him with damage the unfortunate side here is I've got no stamina so I have to back off for a moment but you know we got him still in this corner because we're able to just kind of keep hitting him if he doesn't hit me first for free let's do this a mistake I'm gonna die you didn't mean how the how these weapons are kind of weird to fight against because of their fluidity they're like whips at the same time as their Hammers and swords it's so strange there you go the basic premise is to get them to do their combos wait for it to finish up and then you run and kill them off after you win this fight you get the knocks flowing sword and then you open up a door to a chest back here after you win the fight as well which I believe is a staff yes lousat's Glenstone staff so if you're into sorceries you want to make sure you get that very very cool with that said I am out of here I hope this video does indeed help you thank you so much for tuning in thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

Transcript Text:
hey everyone welcome to another Elden ring boss guy this time we're taking on battle mage hugoos that you can find here at the Celia ever jail in the middle of Kaywood I like to call this guy Judge Judy because he has a giant gavel it's a magic gavel of justice but I'm going to show you how I take him down in the most effective way generally speaking it involves just making him kind of confused as far as what spell he should be casting now you can see that we have this giant Branch or this root going out over here we can definitely use that during this fight to make it so his giant mortar type attacks don't hit us so let me show you what I mean let's get started as is with with all ever jails you want to make sure that when you summon the boss you start swinging immediately as you're able to land a couple free attacks before they can even react all right so here's the uh the mortar attack that I mentioned you see how I dodged to the left there and it's hitting that Roots it makes it so it can't even reach you you know just keep spamming it for a few times you know he'll just keep going but eventually he will stop at that moment you can run in and start beating him up now watch out as he does have comma as well and there's the Judge Judy gavel he will repeat that spell as well so you want to make sure that you're uh you're not standing too close if you're not able to time the Dodge at the last seconds if you see that hammer come out there's no there's no shame in just running away and waiting for him to change up what attack he's doing you just want to make sure that you're utilizing this route right here to make it so his mortar magic right here can't actually hit you as you can see it's just sapping every single projectile and we run in we hit him for some damage Here Comes The Judge Judy gavel we back off we go in for more damage now the other two attacks that he has here outside of the Comets is he will hit you with the club in his left hand sometimes as well as he will try to headbutt you you need to make sure that you're ready for that when you get closer range generally speaking that's those are the attacks that he does the least and you can Parry the club in his left hand as well in fact let's see if we can pull that off here unless if you need him to swing the club there it is I I Parry too early but the good news is we got one anyway so you can see every single Club attack that he has is something that you can indeed Parry here if you want to Parry him I don't think you can Parry the headbutt though I can say that I've never tried so there is that as aspect as well now if you're wondering what to do after he does cross into the main evergel area and he's casting the the mortar spell still you can still stand on the other side of this root and it will hit the root every time as long as you're using specifically the lifted part there he can't actually hit you with it if you keep your distance you just want to keep it basically directly centered between you and him and he'll never be able to hit you with it and then he'll cast Comet a few times but that's okay we run in we slice them up avoid the head butt avoid the hammer it's fine we got this GG game over battle made Hugo's is down and that's how you deal with the Celia ever jail and now you can use him as a summon which is actually pretty cool because who doesn't want Judge Judy on their side dealing out Justice in the land between right right anyways guys thank you for tuning in for another Elden ring boss guide I hope this video helps you if it did make sure you leave a like a comment and of course subscribe to the channel and I'll see you soon for more

Transcript Text:
hey folks welcome to another Elden ring boss guide this time we're at the male effectors ever jail in Southeastern liernia we're gonna be taking on Aiden thief of fire he does wield a flail which is unparriable and he does have a cup uh a couple fire spells he uses catch flame as well as he uses one of the fire giant spell which he rewards us with when we defeat him in this fight you'll be basically focusing on dodging and attacking him in moments of opportunity where it makes sense to you I would recommend keeping your distance from him if possible because his flail can hit very hard and when he does cast the fire spell you can actually like bait it into detonation and then avoid the actual damage from it and I'll show you how let's get started let's open up with a bloody slash just to land some good damage now here's the fire spell and basically it's a giant orb of fire that follows you around when you walk close to it it'll Prime and then detonate you want to make sure once it primes you roll backward out of the way because it does leave a bunch of fire around which will add up damage very quickly so once you avoid that you can get back to the fighting with Aiden deep of fire now as you saw he was doing the um basically just swinging his flail around like crazy be aware that it will do absolutely massive damage if you get hit by it and he will follow it up with a special flourish attack where he slams it into the ground now the best thing to that you can do is just avoid these attacks just just stay away keep your distance in fact when he does these attacks and leaves a big window of opportunity to counter-attack him and I'll show you let's wait for him to do the uh The Swinging strike thing again let me show you how to prime this uh this spell all you have to do is walk near it you'll see it Glow and then you just roll away let's go let's wait for him to do The Swinging strikes do it no no fire let's prime it again now we back up very good do it do the thing no man the thing there it is oh I messed it up guys I'm sorry do the thing man all right we primed that for detonation we roll away I need you to do the special swings basically it opens up a big big attack of opportunity for you that's what I'm trying to show but he's just he usually does it a lot more than this he's just not right now foreign here we go now you'll see when you get a little bit closer he'll do a special attack at the very end you just step back and then you walk forward and you can land two or three hits very easily that is the single best moment of opportunity to strike him outside of that you got to kind of get creative and wait for him to do some heavy attacks and stuff like that to land your own if he does try to drink his his Estus flask you can try to uh land a big attack there because he's kind of immobilized for a moment so that's another great opportunity as well I'm not sure why but a lot of the NPCs in this game will randomly do that even if they don't have one available all right here we go a big attack of opportunity here opportunity of attack rather oh you got a little dodgy come on [Music] and there we go Aiden thief of fire is pretty straightforward you just need to make sure you're not getting hit by the fire spells specifically I'm actually pretty surprised he didn't try to catch flame me at all but basically if you are going toe-to-toe with him he will try to catch flame you need to you need to be careful because the catch flame spell does a massive amount of damage very quickly and he will multicast it meaning that if he hits you with it once he'll try to hit you with again and again on repeat which will 100 to zero you extremely quickly if you're not careful anyways guys I hope this guy I hope this guide helps you thank you for tuning in for another boss guide on my channel make sure you leave a like a comment and subscribe and I'll see you soon for more

Title: How To Defeat Leonine Misbegotten (Grafted Blade Greatsword Location) - Elden Ring Gameplay Guide
Video ID: 8BUHA0HZivI
Transcript Text:
hey guys welcome to the channel for another Elden ring boss guide this time we're taking on Castle mourn's boss the leonine Miss begotten this guy drops a very unique weapon called the grafted Greatsword a grafted great blade if you know George RR Martin's Books A Song of Ice and Fire then you know the idea of the Iron Throne imagine that but into a great sword it's a bunch of smaller swords melted together it's pretty cool concept so in this video I'm going to discuss how I defeat this boss and how I go about countering his move sets to do so now this guy as you can see is going to be very agile he's Nimble on his feet and can do a lot of damage very quickly so I do recommend going in here with a good amount of health and then being prepared to do a lot of dodging this right here that attack where he stabs his sword into the ground is the single best opportunity to attack him keep that in mind once he stabs his sword into the ground it takes to a mole a moment to actually pull it back out so you want to make sure that you are ready to attack at that moment it can be difficult to get him to do it a lot of the time when you want to but there's nothing wrong with just being a little patient not getting greedy for damage like I just did there you can sneak in a lot of attacks after a lot of his own attacks here and there as well I find it best to just kind of take it easy be patient just kind of have to accept that if you are a new player specifically that you're going to struggle with this fight specifically this is why I have found to be one of the harder fights when I was moved to Alvin rang so as you can see I'm just kind of capitalizing on his weakest moments right there where he stabs the sword into the ground because it can land very quick two down two attacks there it is again we can land two attacks and then back off most of this fight is just about learning the Dodge timing and I failed that one too as you can see it's very easy to just kind of roll his attacks early because a lot of them are so very delayed but you see because of the size of the sword and his Mobility the actual swing speed can be surprising in two different directions sometimes he delays them so they're very slow other times he doesn't delay them at all so they're very fast it's a it's a it's a bit of a learning process it can be a lot all right here's the attack this is the one we capitalize on WE attack twice we back off keep in mind that when he does scream like that oftentimes it will do damage to you if you're too close if you want to make sure you're not too close to him if you can avoid that plan two attacks back up roll these jump attacks stay far away there's that uh that faster strike than you would think there where the leonine must be gone ouch you can see that even though I've played this game a bunch this guy still catches me off guard with the actual speed of his attacks still at this time just catches me off guard when he does the double jump you can land one quick attack if your weapon is fast enough so you can swing there too if you want to make the most of the time but I would recommend for most people to just kind of avoid it unless you have a very fast weapon same with that attack there with that double horizontal 360 slash if you are too close they uh chances are is one of them will hit you unless you jump with that attack because it does go a little bit lower towards the legs you can jump over it but if you try to dodge then you're likely going to get hit by the first one or the second one because of the actual timing of it unfortunately that's just the reality of that specific attack there you go we capitalized on his weakest uh weakest moment once again and there it is the grafted blade Greatsword I know it took a lot of hits there so it's not the best visual representation but I specifically wanted to show the best moment of attack and for you as a player now if you are a mage going into this fight you can uh basically you just want to maintain your distance and just keep spamming your spells make sure you're not spamming your spells while he's charging at you though he is very aggressive and he will non-stop go at you if you are like throwing Spells at him and arrows and stuff but you can still find a window of opportunity to cast you know a quick Flintstone uh you know Glenstone blade or Pebble stuff like that so it is still possible even with magic you just have to make sure you're really pacing yourself so you're not being punished for casting the spell overall anyways guys I hope this video helps you thank you so much for watching thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

Title: How To Defeat Crystalians - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: Dxdffpklp88
Transcript Text:
hey everyone thank you for tuning in for another eldering boss guide this time we're talking about the crystallians inside the academy Crystal Cave there are a lot of crystallians throughout the entire game but this is often the first instance in which players will discover them now the first thing you're going to notice is if you're using Pierce Weaponry or slash Weaponry or even standard Weaponry you're not able to do a whole lot of damage in this fight I'm going to use curved swords and I'm going to teach you how to fight them without using hammers or you know any other type of strike Weaponry if you do have strike Weaponry you are in an advantage here where you can go in and do a lot more damage a lot faster because they are weak to it but if you only if you do not have that type of Weaponry then watch what I do you're gonna see two of them in here I'm gonna focus on the one with the spear first because that's the one that's a lot more aggressive you can Parry them very easily and that's what I'm going to do here to show you and then you can repost you see how little damage that does now it's not the damage that I'm trying to do there I'm trying to knock him down so I can land a heavy attack like so what you want to do is land a lot of heavy attacks and jumping attacks against them when you do it breaks down their Poise a lot faster and now once you break their Poise you'll see that they have this uh this new animation on their skin or they look like they've shattered once they look like they're shattered their entire defense is gone and now you can just do completely normal damage against them as you can see you can do this by jumping attacks you can do it by heavy R2 attacks so on so forth but as you can see once you break their Poise for the first time their defense is basically non-existent and it's very easy to do you just need to land some jumping attacks or some heavy attacks or even jump heavy attacks jump r2s are the probably the best possible thing you can do you just want to make sure that all the while you are avoiding their attacks they're very very basic in the attacks that they actually do so there's not a whole lot to worry about there I would just say play carefully try to engage one at a time and just slowly break down their Poise and once you do you'll see that they just take full damage do not need strike Weaponry to make this work you can just use whatever whatever you want and also once they are shattered as well you saw before how I wasn't able to interrupt the spell casting of this one but now I can it basically removed their entire Poise as well and there you have it there you have it crystallians made easy now again when you are in the academy Crystal Cave once you once you defeat these enemies do not leave right away you see this little teleport right here a lot of people consider the dungeon here done at this point but you'll notice back here there's an elevator if you go up the elevator there's a very very powerful spell called Terra Magicka which increases the damage of all of your glenstone-based Magics which if you are a sorcerer this is a very important spell to get even if you're only using a couple Glenstone based sorceries it's completely worth grabbing not only will it make your damage go that much further further so you can use it against uh a lot of people like to use it against enemies like eldenbeast or placidusacks because they're such large enemies and it's easy to land a lot of spells on them if you grab this spell it'll make it so your damage goes that much further too do you just go up the elevator you climb up the stairs then you climb up the ladder you go to this chest open it up and then boom Terra Magicka very very good spell if you're into sorceries that's it for now guys I hope this video helps you take on the crystallines and grab that spell thank you so much for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

Title: How To Defeat Commander O'Neil (Unalloyed Gold Needle Location) - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: d-mf69GgbSE
Transcript Text:
hey everyone thank you for tuning in for another Elden ring boss guide this time we're talking about Commander O'Neill that you can find the swamp of aeonia here in caled I am next to the site of Grace called inner Ionia I don't have the map cleared off but all the same you you know the swamp you know where the swamp is all right yeah if you're already here you're already here anyways you fight Commander O'Neal here now the first thing I'm going to talk about is if you defeat the Invader of Millicent you can actually summon her for this fight right here she will help you all you have to do is just summon her if you choose to do so the biggest thing about this fight is making sure that you kill all the summons there's gonna be a bit of a bit of a small Squad of soldiers in the area some of them have swords and shields all of them have crossbows and then when he goes into phase two he summons three battle ax wielding soldiers as well I do recommend worrying about killing them first as that is the easiest way to make it so you can just really focus on the boss here so I'm gonna do that first running into this we're gonna basically ignore Commander O'Neill completely as we take out all these smaller soldiers around the sides all right they don't have much health they're pretty quick to take out but they can overwhelm you if you let them so you need to make sure that you uh take care of them as quick as possible [Music] also Commander O'Neal while he's on the side he actually casts spells to buff them this one he gives them damage negation he has another one where he increases their attack damage too which he just did right there so you want to make sure that you just kind of get rid of them so that way they're just out of the way I think there's a good like six or seven of them we killed three and there's three more so there's six of them you want to kill you focus on this first it'll make it so focusing on the actual boss fight is that much simpler now the next thing I want to talk about is Commander O'Neal does have a giant halberd called the battle standard it is extremely periable and it's very easy to Parry as well I'll show you in just a moment now that it's one on one let me show you how to Parry him any attack that he does with this including the two-handed attacks are parryable as you can see he does have a good amount of health and he does have a very large amount of armor so you know just be aware of this and as you can see you can just cycle through these parries if you want to I'll do it one more time just to show oh I missed that one if you do if he does swing at you and you miss your Parry he will follow it up with Scarlet Rob Base attack so make sure that you get out of there as quickly as possible I'm glad that happened to show you actually so there you go he's very easy to Parry but I'm going to show you how to fight him with dodging as that's what the majority of players are going to do now as you can see sometimes he loses his mind here and he does a big Scarlet Rock based attack and then kneels down basically he has to recover for a moment you want to make sure that you can land a couple hits while he's down on one knee with that said let's get melee Style on him if you wait until he does that Scarlet Rod attack right there he'll give you a moment to land a couple of pretty good attacks and then you can back off dodging him like crazy and then when he's done with his combo run in and do it again and then back off wait until he repeats the Scarlet Rod attack run in hit him again and that's the cycle that is his biggest moment of weakness and that's the one you want to capitalize on the most so as long as you keep doing that cycle over and over this fight won't be so bad for you again he does have a good amount of health so you want to make sure that you're playing it safe you're not taking a lot of damage it is a battle of endurance but if you can get through it then you know it's one less boss you have to worry about in the game now he's gonna go phase two when he's gonna summon these three other enemies so let's let him do that you want to make sure that you take them out as well so that way they're not in the way of what you're doing here I can't believe he didn't do it Go phase two man he won't go phase two okay let me just run away from him he'll go phase two if I leave [Music] go phase two [Music] NO phase two what are you doing okay he really wants it I guess guys he really wants it look at this oh phase two please there it is so he'll wave his battle standard around and he'll summon three battle ax wielding enemies and they will all rush you simultaneously this is where the fight can get extremely overwhelming so you want to make sure that you try to take them out as fast as possible what I like to do is make sure they're all grouped up and then I use my ash of War on them whatever my ash of War may be so that way it can hit as many of them as possible now he will do the same Buffs like he did on the previous guys he'll buff up their off attack and their defense so just try to take them out as quickly as possible just to be done with them that's when I did my first playthrough that was the part of the fight that was the most trivializing to me now I'm going to show you the parries again it's still the same idea here very easy to Parry his attacks as they have a very large hitbox and they're very slow you can just keep repeating that if you want but I'm gonna go back to dodging him to show you this best moment of opportunity of attack again you just want to stay just Out Of Reach when he slams it down run in attack get out and then he does the Scarlet Rod attack he'll wave the battle standard around Smash It On The Ground you attack you back off again as long as you keep repeating that same cycle Commander O'Neal will die in no time [Music] I'm trying to make this guy the most simple so that way everyone can understand the best opportunity that you as a player will be able to take him out I think this is the best possible moment he has a couple of big opportunities where he's not doing much so you can just run in hit him back off again and if you do have ranged attacks as well if you're using like a bow or magic because he has a very heavy set of armor he actually does not Dodge so you can actually take him out very quickly with things like magic and arrows as well if you choose to do so it is a very big option for you in this fight one of the very few enemies in the game that won't go out of their way to dodge these attacks so you can definitely capitalize on that here against Commander O'Neill you see I'm just repeating the same thing over and over those same exact moments on repeats he's barely able to reach me I'm doing all the damage in the world playing it extremely safe and he can't do a thing about it he's just he's just too slow toying with him at this point I got greedy don't do that don't do that there we go so as long as you just attack him at the right moments there you'll be able to make quick work of him you get the commander standard and you get the unalloid gold needle which you need for Millicent sidequest which is a pretty cool side quest by the way it's pretty great I love the way it goes anyways guys I hope this video helps you thank you for tuning in for another Elden ring boss guide this time for Commander nie O'Neal thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

Title: How To Defeat Putrid Avatar - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: 8z9QbE_Lacw
Transcript Text:
hey everyone welcome to my channel for another Elden ring boss guide this time we're talking about putrid avatars the putrid Avatar is identical to the Ury Ury avatars except for one thing they spray a wide Arc of scarlet rot in front of them whenever they do the butt slam on the ground so I'm going to teach you how I personally like to avoid that move and take care of them as quickly as possible you can see that I'm fighting the single toughest one in the entire game and that I died once already while trying to record this cuz I got slammed on right in front of this minor her tree in Northeast kid so let's go ahead and get over there and see if we can defeat this bad boy and I'm going to teach you how I dodge around the uh his body slam I like to dodge around the trees right side which is our left whenever he's about to land so that way not only does the slam miss us but also we get out of range of the Scarlet rot spray sometimes when we do this it will make us uh if he does it too often we might end up circling around into some more Scarlet rot that's still lingering around but all the same what you do in that moment is just back off if you feel that you need to you can see that I'm circling around our left side which is the tree right watch out for that Stomp and you can see that he's going to be doing this stomp an awful lot it is his most common move especially when you're staying right next to him he does still do the uh the holy missile attack here too so you want to make sure you do the same thing as you do with the basic urgery Avatar you want to run at about a 90° angle from them and if you can find a moment to afford to do so you want to make sure you can pop a heal so that way you're keeping your health up which is pretty basic idea but you know in this case against this boss you do have the afforded window to be able to do so something else I will say as well specifically for this putrid Avatar you want to make sure that you try to stay on as even ground as possible now we are on a bit of a hill so finding even ground is actually pretty difficult but if you're on too much of the incline it'll make it so it's harder to stay out of the range of the Scarlet rot I've made that mistake many times myself and so you need to be very careful within this specific fight you see how much damage the Scarlet Rod did there just because I was standing in it even though it didn't hit me directly it does insane amount of damage so you need to be very careful of where you choose to fight on this incline we got him under half Health now so we're getting close we should be getting a frostbite proc again soon and I just keep going the same way I just keep dodging around his right side our left and is working out for us again watch out for the Scarlet rots it does linger around a good while so you just have to be really careful about this but it looks like we're pretty good we should be able to uh afford ourselves the W the wind condition here in just a moment oh there's that incline screwing us again the biggest issue with the incline is it makes it so the Scarlet rot doesn't go as far away and that's what causes the issue here so need to back off and then run at a 90° angle from the uh the magic missiles the holy missiles Dodge the uh the hammer here the staff here comes a butt slam and here comes the win and so there you go basically if you just keep circling around him so I I like to go to our left or its right but I do believe you can go around the other way as well I don't like to go the other way specifically because his stomp attack is his right foot so if we stay closer to his right foot he won't do this crazy spin maneuver to try to pull that off and I do find that uh his stomp ability much easier to to dodge from that angle because he's not doing a weird janky spin animation but okay uh that should take care of that the puted Avatar if you copy what I did just there you should be able to make it through that fight and you can see that he drops a lot of runes he drops over 91,000 runes here which is very beneficial if you can take him out a little bit earlier in the game anyways guys thank you for tuning in for another elering boss guide I hope this video helps you thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

Video ID: LPsj6IBif8A
Transcript Text:
hey folks welcome back for another eldering boss guy this time we're taking on Loretta inside of the karia Manor in the northwest region of liernia you can see that I did to tempt this once already as I did die there um but unfortunately she was not acting like her normal self as she was doing some very weird things that she just normally does not do and they just it was very weird patterns that I've not seen before from Loretta so I'm trying this again anyways uh we're gonna take her on by uh showing off a little bit of how to Parry her as well as the right moments to dodge and counter-attack so let's get this started generally speaking when you get started for the first fights you can run in and land some very free and easy damage so I do recommend doing that if she hasn't spawned yet it just kind of gives you a couple moments to do a few hundred damage to her the things you need to watch out for are her uh her magic attacks there she has the Glenstone blades alongside Flintstone Pebbles that she'll throw at you constantly during phase one they're very easy to dodge you only have to roll once out of the way to make it work she does have the basic horse stomp that every horse-based enemy in the game has and then uh these attacks change up a little bit during phase two I'll talk about that when we get there anyways let's talk about how to Parry her she will leap at you and slam the war sickle on the ground what you want to do is not Parry that one Dodge that one and then follow up with a Parry on the second strike right there you can hit her once she'll move away you hit her again and then she'll uh either jump back like that or swing the sickle at you if she swings the sickle at you again you can follow it up with another parry and another counter a counter attack in that moment as well let's show it again there it is there's the strike we run up we strike again there's the second Perry and then she'll do basically do the same thing and then she'll generally most of the time Jump away in that moment to cast a spell it's not very often at all that she'll do it a third time so I wouldn't count on it happening let's show it again we Parry we strike we move towards her we strike again she's gonna attack we Parry again we strike we follow up with another strike she'll jump away she'll cast a spell you dodge and now she's gonna go phase two let me show you how to take her on with dodges now during phase two you're gonna see that her spells are a little bit different and she'll also gain a new one called Loretta's bow let's see if we can get to Loretta's bow to happen here all right come here we need to go phase two all right phase two time phase two time so now you're seeing that these uh Glenstone blades are coming at us in different intervals they come in waves of two or three which means that you'll have to dodge two or three extra times in order to avoid them so be aware of that there's Loretta slash that's the ash of War on her weapon and it does have a few different variants so you need to basically watch out very closely for what's happening they are just identical to basic strikes a little bit more of a flourish so all you just need to do is focus on dodging at the right times there from there let's teach how to you know Dodge we Dodge she's gonna go for a second strike there but instead of pairing it you can move behind her like I just did and then smack her horse on the ass very basic is now we're behind her we strike usually the third attack does not hit but I wasn't behind her far enough so I messed that up by the way you can see that these magic attacks are just you just gotta Dodge to one side or the other a lot of them you can dodge by running but I just like to uh to dodge this is a very basic Loretta Loretta boss fight right here she just spams her spells for 20 minutes there you go move in for a quick strike here comes the bow we Dodge I wanted to do the melee attack again so I can get behind her and show you how to do that here we go do the second strike nope she changed it up on me if you get too far behind her too quickly she'll cast that spell on you instead very good here's the swing here's the secondary swing the Troy three swing the Atlanta attack damn I timed that poorly you get the gist though that's the moment that you can strike and land a lot of damage oh I'm in pain and so you can see that you can run away from these as well but do not try to outrun Loretta's bow you can outrun the swords but not the bow keep that in mind but okay I think I've shown enough I think we can just kind of finish off the fight now you should be very comfortable with her moveset at this point you've seen everything that she has to offer aside from the secondary type of Loretta slash so let's just move in for the kill shall we I like to do this via Paris this fight can be tough because of her magic spam but if you know the right moments to uh to attack and all that it's not so bad just don't fail your parries like I did there and then get hit by the bow like I did there you know do better than me there you go when you do win the fight you get Loretta's great bow as well as the capability of moving behind the uh the area here there isn't ever jail over here with some stuff going on and then you have a whole bunch of stuff out here including a dragon you can go speak to Ronnie about her quests all that stuff anyways guys I hope this video helps you thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

Transcript Text:
hey everyone thank you for tuning in for another Elden ring boss guide this time we're talking about Eleanor of the Briar which you can find up here at shaded Castle it's in the northern area between Mount gilmir and Altus Plateau as you can see in this poison swamp if you make it here and you defeat this boss you'll be rewarded with Mariah's executioner sword which is a very very fun Greatsword to use the uh the ash of War on it is very very fun uh the things I want to talk about here are the best moments to Parry dodging and counter-attacking as well as how to get him stuck in a shield slamming Loop so you can land a lot of free damage on his back you can't backstab him but if you do it right you can make him repeat his shield slam over and over again until he finally decide finally decides to either break it or get staggered and allows you to get a critical hit on him let's get started here we're going to open up with some parrying and see if we can get him to do the uh The Shield slam my biggest bit of advice for this fight is to make sure you dodge the command grab at the very last seconds as well as make sure that you stay close to him if you try to go too far away he will start to swing his sword around like Darth Vader which is very damning there's the first shield slam unfortunately he did not repeat it but we're able to get a couple parries on him anyway when he does get knocked down you can land a quick charged R2 on him if you are able to do so and that is something I would recommend as well because it can land a lot of extra damage as well as break his toys on the regular as you can see all of his attacks are payable except if the weapon is glowing red if the weapon is glowing red you cannot Parry you have to dodge as you can see the only attack of his sword that is not periable is when it's not going red is the sword thrust here's the command grab again we have to dodge at the very last seconds he opens him up opens himself up for a free attack there after his attack combos you can land a very easy swing there's the shield slam let's see if we can get him in the loop he's not doing the loop I'm gonna try to get him in this Loop so I can show you guys how it works all right there's the slam why is he not doing it guys did they fix the loop they actually fix this sometime soon or sometime recently there it is do it again okay here we go so you can just keep repeating this you just have to make sure you get right behind him you basically have to be exactly 180 degrees behind him here and he'll just keep doing it over and over again allowing you to keep hitting him in the back for free you can hit him once or twice as you can see outside of that you basically just want to wait until his combos are finished stay close range so his sword doesn't hit you I'm just gonna leave him at one HP here for a moment so you can watch his moveset a little bit here here's the shield slam loop again as you can see it's very easy to get a minute [Music] very easy to get him into it we're just dodging him I'm showing you his moveset so you understand what he can do so if you don't want to actually go look at it in the game yourself you can watch what I do here Dodge the command get grab at the very last moments don't get hit by the sword never try to Parry if it glows red ever it hurts a lot trust me try the loop again here it is very good you see it just opens them up for a lot of attack of opportunity here for opportunity of attack words are hard anyways let's kill him off and that's basically the majority of his move sad if you try to run away he will swing his sword at you like Darth Vader I do not recommend fighting him from distance even if you're a mage I would recommend just trying to melee him um it's possible as a mage but man it's just kind of frustrating your best bet as a mage if you do want to go at him with that is to use things like carrion slicer and catch flame you know just very quick to cast magic spells like that to whittle them down slowly after that make sure you praise uh praise Melania you know praise Melania and make sure you also leave a like a comment and subscribe to my channel and video hope this video guys helps you guys thank you for tuning in I'll see you soon for more

Title: How To Defeat Ancient Dragon Lansseax (Lansseax's Glaive Location) - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: AEjjePoEr6M
Transcript Text:
hey folks thank you for tuning in for another eldering boss guy this time we're discussing Lance ax a legendary dragon you do find Lance ax for the first time down here when you first enter Altus Plateau by the abandoned coffin after defeating magma or Makar lansex will Ambush you right there at the number one after you drain about one-fifth of its Health it will fly away and a lot of people don't know where you find it again it's actually right over here right outside the walls of Langdale on the West Side to get there you just want to follow this path here going north and when you get to this bridge the forest spanning great bridge bridge right by the site of Grace you'll find a way Gates you when you use teleport you across to the other side of the bridge you can just follow the path all the way down this way and when you find this fork in the road you can go south follow it all the way down you'll find us the sainted heroes grave you can just follow the slope a little bit Southeast and you'll find the lansex spawns right here right here in this in this vicinity at the number one now Lance ax does have a lot of lightning move Ancient Dragon Lightning moves at that when it swings its claws around it generates a lot of electricity so you need to be careful of that as it can hit you and do a lot of damage very quickly and then from there it'll Roar which generates a lot of electricity as well it can tail swipe it can blow fire out of its face like all dragons do in this game as well as it does have the legendary move lansex's glaive which you do get rewarded with when you defeat them so with that said let's get started you'll see that my strategy is basically running at its back legs constantly and tickling its toes another another boss in this game where we call the toe stress so once a crash lands you run for its back Feats it'll take a moment to Roar so that way it generates a lot of electricity land your combo and then back off from the electricity there you see how it swung and it generate electricity as well that's pretty scary there's lansex's glaze you just want to dodge right at the very last second before it hits the ground and then you just go at the back legs like crazy now breaking the Poise of this dragon is pretty difficult but it is possible all the same it is possible I really would not worry about it though I would more focus on trying to land you know whatever damage you can as far as bleed and frost maybe even a little bit of poison or Scarlet rods those are the most effective ways to apply damage to this boss okay here is the uh the wing move luckily that move does no damage so you don't have to worry about bats but you still need to make sure that you can avoid getting knocked down if you can if you are to get knocked down you need to make sure that you recover quickly because it'll often follow up with another attack that does big damage like a ground pound or something like that there's a bit of a lunge generally speaking that biting lunge can do damage but it's pretty hard to get hit by if I'm being honest with you it's pretty easy to dodge just by walking to the side of it there's lands Lance takes his blade again if you do happen to find a window of opportunity to get underneath lansayaks you'll find that the glaive just cannot hit you so there is that as well and then when it rears up on its hind legs and starts blowing fire you can just go crazy on its tail and land a ton of damage and that would be my recommendation in that moment as you can see overall Lancey act has taken down very quickly by Frost and bleed not a major deal you just kind of do what you would normally do against most Dragons Keep your patience keep your stamina up and just focus on asex Survival don't get hit by the fire like I did there it can do a lot of damage very quickly we don't like that just hit the tail man and it's over be really careful and pace yourself make sure that you always have at least a little bit of stamina so that way you're not caught off guard you want to make sure you can roll at least a couple times so never just spend all your stamina if you can avoid it and if you do have a small stem in a pool then just be aware of your regeneration make sure that you're making that a priority because the damage that landsex can do can be quite surprising no matter how much health you have with that said guys I hope this video helps you thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

Title: How To Defeat Fallingstar Beast - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: TXzR3CiZwqQ
Transcript Text:
hey folks thank you for joining me for another Elden ring boss guy this time we're going to be discussing and taking on the falling star Beast that you can find up here in Mount gilmir just next to the ninth Mount gilmir campsites you can either climb up the ladder all the way up there or use this uh what is it called this wind thing the windspring to jump all the way up there with your horse you can fight this thing from horseback if you choose however I choose to not I like to fight it on foot I find it a little bit easier the big thing with this falling star beast and why making the video for this one specifically is it has a very special move where it shoots a laser beam out of its eyeball which can do a lot of damage if it hits you so I'm going to be talking about its moves how to avoid them and defeating the boss let's do this thing the worst part about this fight is the actual landscape here so I like to coach to this side because it has the most open area when it is doing its charge attack here when it starts to charge up you just want to run to the right and then left and keep alternating that until it's finished running at you you'll see that it has some moves where it'll throw its face at you you want to just roll out of the way and oftentimes it'll actually do three swings where it's last part of it will end up hitting the ground very hard and that moment gives you a big opportunity to attack him another big moment here is the delayed tail strike you want to make sure that you don't get hit by that do not panic roll wait until the last second to dodge it there's that move there here comes another tail strike Dodge at the very last second there and now you can see we're gonna run to the right and this is the same pattern every time with this charging attack you want to run rights then left every single time and you'll you'll just never get hit by it s next move you can see earlier that it was doing a bit of uh this charge thing here where the spikes come out of the ground it'll do it twice and then the third time is a much larger one after the large one you can actually land a big hit on its back end there very easily so I recommend taking that moment to do so when you do understand that attack a little bit more you'll be able to basically do that every single time without fail you'll see a lot of the time too where it'll just kind of stare you down it gets a little bit weird it gets a little bit weird another attack I do want to talk about is it'll jump up in the air and do like a like a flip at you you want to make sure that you don't Dodge forward or backward you want to jump to the left or the right if you try to uh Dodge forward or backward it has a lot of frames to it which means that it will hit you if you Dodge in those directions it's much longer than your actual Dodge animation you have to dodge left or right there as you can see we're just very casually taking this boss on hitting it with the same strikes over and over after its big attacks here you see how I'm dodging that that attack the same way every time and it's allowing me to get a big moment to attack him it's the same thing over and over with that attack specifically just don't let the delayed tail strikes hit you here's the charge again we run rights we run left we run rights and sometimes if you're close enough after it's doing the charge you can actually hit them I actually went in a little bit early on my attack and so I missed it unfortunately kind of cute look at him it's kind of cute in a weird way okay here's the roll we're gonna Dodge left I'm glad they did that attack so I could show you now the time that he'll do the charged particle beam or laser beam out of its eyeball is actually during its second phase you'll see that uh oh shoot this is a big attack yeah sometimes they'll do that too or he'll just charge up an area next to him you just gotta get out of there I forgot about that one here's one where he flings rocks at you just dodge the Rocks if you are close enough after that you can get a quick strike on his face or legs that's a big moment of opportunity but yeah his a laser beam that'll shoot out of his eyeball he'll actually do uh just after he runs around and so when he does that you need to make sure that you run up specifically to his right side if you run to his right side which is on your left you won't get hit by it and then you can just swing away at him for free for a moment you can land almost a full combo with any weapon during it too it's pretty good I won't kill him until I can show you this attack as well a big issue with this fight is just how drawn out it can be we've already been doing this for like four minutes and I've only got them down to quarter health he's just very slow and allowing you opportunity to strike okay so here we are here we're able to land a quick strike because he did The Rock thing there avoid the bites Swing Away Dodge the tail and the rocks and here comes the Crags land our strike we back up here comes the delayed tail strike very good here comes the charge we go right we go left we go right he does that thing let's close the gap a little bit he's gonna charge again we gotta go right oh he's done already all right I'm not sure how he didn't fall off the ledge there but it is what it is you can land our hit there we back off this is one of his most powerful attacks when he does a big charge you see how wide this field is when he starts charging up this attack you just need to run you can dodge it at the last second if you know the timing but keep in mind that the charge down does damage as well and if he does hit you with that animation it actually slams you onto the ground and does huge damage I'm glad that he did that in that moment so allowed me an opportunity to really show you uh you just need to run away from that attack I don't recommend trying to time the Dodge it's not worth it all right we landed some good damage there I dodged a little bit early you can see now as well that since he's glowing he's technically in phase two which means he might do a Charged particle beam attack soon we're just casually taking our time making the most of our damage roll the Rocks land our strikes back off don't let the tail hit you can you see what I mean by the terrain being the hardest part of this fight though it's so uneven all right we gotta Dodge that attack again get out of there get out of that field you see how the Rocks go up and then the Rocks go down both sections of that can damage you very good here he swings his face like crazy and the tail be aware of that here comes more rocks we dodge it him on the nose hit him on the nose again watch out for that grab that can do big damage too here it comes with the charge he might be doing the laser beam now let's see here it comes so we run up to his right side and we just swing away like crazy here this gives us the most opportunity to hit him we were able to land 1400 damage there which is the most damage I've been able to do yet which is massive get out of there land another attack here comes the jump We Roll to the side and it still hits me I rolled a little bit early oh he almost got me here comes the charge attack again gotta go I barely made it out let's top off our health let's finish him off shall we oh I got very lucky with that last hit there I don't know how the tail didn't hit me but all right that's how you defeat the falling star Beast now there are a few of these throughout the game but that right there is the single toughest one and when you defeat it you get the falling star Beast jaw which is a very very powerful weapon actually has a great Ash of War on it anyways guys I'm out of here for now thank you so much

Title: How To Defeat Rykard, Lord of Blashpemy - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: ckIcj4I4hG0
Transcript Text:
hey everyone thank you for tuning in for another Elden ring boss guide this time we're taking on rycard the god devouring serpents uh you can find him here at the audience pathway when you progress your way through the volcano Manor um you can see here that I do have the serpent hunting spear this is what I call a gimmick weapon very similar to some gimmick weapons that you find in other souls-borne games like the uh the storm Seeker sword that you can use against uh the giants in Dark Souls 3 very similar idea you can defeat him with other means but this is what the game wants you to do this weapon exists precisely to kill Reichard so we're gonna walk in the room and I'm gonna show you how to use it what I do recommend is that you use the ash of War on this Weapon It's called Great Serpent hunt it only does this special animation here like by the way you only see like a special wind type animations here with it but you want to make sure that you have a few flasks to really go with this weapon now this weapon is base level you see that it's just the basic serpent Hunter we do not have it leveled up whatsoever you do not need to level it up it does not benefit you much to do so and I don't think it's worth your time or effort or your smithing Stones so with that said what we're going to do is enter this Boss Arena run directly up to the serpent and just immediately spam L2 on him you can hit L2 once and then after the animation you can hit L2 again to get a second animation that does even more damage right here and there's a second one and then when that attack is over if you have leftover stamina you can do a jump R2 what you really want to do is after you uh you know get bitten by the snake like I did like a big dummy like a big dummy you want to make sure you dodge those bites by the way don't do as I do there you can uh do a lot of jump r2s and that's going to be a lot of your damage in this fight as well he will do different uh bite animations at you that bite animation he'll do one to three times make sure you just roll out of the way of it and then in between a lot of his attacks you can land another jumping R2 as you can see here we just repeat it again and after about 30 seconds or so you can do the uh the ash of War again and that would be my recommendation there now that attack there where he tears up the ground and just sends a huge wave of lava at you I've never been good at dodging so my advice there is if it happens just make sure you have enough help to deal with it I that's one I can't really help you with I'm sorry land another jumping attack after he's done with his combos as you can see here and now that it's been well over 30 seconds we can land a Nash of War on them and we'll stagger him again and if you do enough damage quickly you'll be able to actually break his voice and that's something that you really want to try to do if you can break his Poise it allows you to land a lot of damage as well unfortunately I don't think I'm gonna be able to on this specific fight to show you but that's okay nope just kidding we did it when he does land on the ground I like to do two charged r2s as you can see you get enough time to do so and that'll do a lot of damage as well you don't have to use the ash of War here but I do recommend it as it has massive Poise break to it and it's worth doing and now what I need you to do if this video guide does help you leave a leave together in the comments section okay also we are recording this live let's see your best togethers in chat while we watch this cutscene together we're gonna wash this together as family okay [Music] oh very well does anyone else keep swords in their throats is that something we should all start doing I don't know it doesn't seem like a very convenient place but at the same time it does seem Ultra convenient like oh I need to sort for this situation pulls out sword from throat it's both convenient and not convenient at the same time hell yeah okay now phase two you're gonna see that uh he's got some new moves including a giant sword he will do several sword swings at you and you want to make sure that you dodge them as they do big damage I failed my Dodge there because I thought he was doing the other poke but that's fine he also does this thing where he'll uh do reichardt's Rancor at you right there if you time your attack well with L2 it'll actually break the animation which will make it so that reichardt's ranker will not be there you just have to make sure that you time it well the next thing you need to time is make sure that you're dodging your rolls for the sword properly you can see that he has some very delayed strikes you want to make sure that you do it right because if you do fail then you just end up flat on your back and taking a ton of damage make sure your Mana is enough to use L2 again land your attacks where you can watch out for the magma splash I got a little greedy here but it's fine we're just taking small magma damage we're good I rolled a little early on that one more sword pokes we can help too now he is going into his phase where he starts launching a bunch of skulls everywhere so be aware of that this is when things get a little bit crazy he Stomps on the ground raised his sword to the sky and you're gonna start seeing you know magma geysers you're gonna start seeing skulls fly everywhere as well as he'll fight at you with the serpent as well so you need to make sure that you pay attention and you're ready for it when the skulls start flying at you as you can see all that all those reichard's rankers I like to just kind of run away from him the biggest reason being is that he does this incredibly strong sword animation that's almost identical to the ash of War of the sword itself make sure you're keeping enough stamina to keep on sprinting wait for him to do his uh his big Ash of War and when the ash of war is done that whole phase is done and you can move in closer for the kill again let's do our thing if time will have passed as well so it'll allow us to do our L2 spam Arena let's get on it foreign damage for that Dodge the snake land your jumping r2s where possible Haggard me unfortunate watch out for the pull out there the big explosion of damage another jump R2 another jump R2 and then a simple R1 for the win [Music] and that's right card now I did take a lot of hits there but you can see that even with all the the hits I took I was able to recover this is something that does have a lot to do with the amount of Health I have and my armor so you need to make sure that you take that into account as well I did that a little bit poorly I usually perform better in that fight but it is what it is you can still find the best moments to attack by watching this video and that's what counts here again make sure you use L2 if you have enough Mana to do so until basically you can't anymore you don't want to spam it non-stop as you know you used to be able to but they patched it out to where he's only staggered by it once every so often so I like to leave a good like 20 to 30 seconds in between them at least until there's a right opportunity to do so from there your jump r2s are key a little secret to the jump bar too as well if you're still here when you do the jump R2 you want to make sure you push up on the right on the left analog stick when you press R2 if you don't press up when you hit R2 you'll actually do some pretty weird animations you'll end up like going to the side or sometimes even backwards it's just how how it works you want to make sure you hold up while you jump into a test it's R2 sorry the stutter so that way it goes forward and hits the serpent in the in the face anyways guys I hope this video helps

Title: How To Defeat Morgott the Omen King - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: RbMrdVOk2ok
Transcript Text:
hey everyone thank you for tuning in for another Elden ring boss guide this time we're going in on morgots if you thought Margaret was hard welcome to morgots the true version of himself Margaret is indeed morgots and he was only toying with you before this time he's in full his full self and he is insanely powerful he doesn't have a whole lot of health so you can you know make the most of the right moments to attack him and we're going to be talking about those right moments in this video and of course you can summon Melina right here and whatever your own personal preference of Ash summon is possible as well you can just see right here this gold summon sign that is Melina so keep that in mind you can use her too but I'll be doing this completely without that we are going to watch this cutscene as it is a very cool cutscene and we're going to discuss some of these uh some of these things to expect so morgot does have two phases when you get them down to about 50 Health then you're gonna see the entire Arena change a little bit you're gonna see a little bit of uh it's gonna be like a brownish yellow liquid stuff going everywhere essentially that's more God's curse when you beat him up a bunch his curse starts to leave him but unfortunately his curse is also his strength so you need to watch out for a lot of special attacks in that moment which we'll be talking about when we get there morgot has an insane amount of Mobility so that's the first thing you need to be aware abouts if you thought that Margaret was fast then this guy's about to blow your mind because he's all over the place okay you're gonna see that his his staff is actually a sword and he's going to break it out in this cutscene and this sword can do very very powerful things including making you bleed and he does have a lot of his faith-based incantation Weaponry the hammer the daggers he's got this time as well a spear with several moves to it and you know he's got his sword and he's got some incredibly crazy combos that he can chain together non-stop so you need to be very very careful about how you go about this you need to avoid these attacks with every little bit of your being because you can get 100 to zeroed extremely fast the big thing about this attack just the big thing about these attacks rather is just like Market earlier on in the game he has a lot of delayed attacks and so you need to be very careful about this I will show the best moments to attack him and the best moments to avoid attacking him all right let's do this thing Kings let's do this thing here's the spear when he is charging up the spear throw you can run at him and land a quick attack there if you're a little bit faster than me you won't get hit by it and then you want to back off immediately after when he goes to charge that spear throw it is one of the best moments to attack him specifically in Phase One there's the very well-known Hammer attack when he charges at you like that you can land another quick attack and then time your Dodge to get out of there properly unfortunately I mis-timed it but that is a good moment to do things as well we get in we attack him we Dodge this let's hit another attack let's back up you can see that those two attacks allow you a pretty good window of opportunity to hit them when you do lower his health to about uh you know down about a sixth or so you're gonna see he's gonna start raining swords here you just want to make sure that you're out of the way of that when he does that spear charge I like to dodge to the left as that's the best area to dodge too for me but a lot of time it'll still hit me you're gonna see that even though I have a lot of experience with this fight I still get hit by things constantly hit that we back up here's the spear attack again I completely missed the Dodge let's get out of the way of this dodge the hammer you already know that attack if you fought Margaret you already know that one here's the spear oh I failed my role terrible what you want to do is just roll out of the way of it and then just hit him once it back off like we did earlier there's the hammer attack I do do not recommend rolling in on him after the hammer he said he doesn't have a lot of health so we're still doing very well but a lot of his attacks just do so much damage despite my armor you can attack him on that one and oh my God he's so Zoomy basically any any move that he has where he like starts to run at you and then goes to like Dodge away if you Dodge in the same direction that he does you'll find that you can actually uh land a quick hit and back off like right there if I was closer I'd be able to hit him and then roll out like I did before earlier too all right we roll This we hit him all right now he's going phase two you can hit him a few times and then back off as there is there's going to be a curse explosion and now his sword is glowing with curse now his weapon is going to start applying a lot of bleed so you need to be very careful here as well as it's going to cause every time he hits the ground specifically it's going to cause a bit of a curse explosion as well you'll see here there's the curse explosion on the on the left and then he has this attack this is just like the attack that he has earlier in the game but this time infused with blood flame which is kinda nuts be very careful about getting hit by that as it can do massive damage he does have another attack where his sword will glow red and he'll try to stab you as well be very careful about not getting hit by that one as it's basically a command grab where he stabs you does a bunch of lead and then throws you I'm gonna see if I can get him to do it okay very good very good Pace on that attack there's more of the cursed explosions hit him with this I missed roll tourism I missed again just out of range you can see that he has just so much fluidity to his movements if you did not know via the lore he actually defeated radon in single combat so that's something to consider about this fight too so just imagine that he's able to defeat radon he's gonna be hard for the player to defeat as well ah that combo almost always gets me let's heal up I didn't like the positioning there so I just backed off let's roll with him random attack back up there's the stab very good after that stab you can find a good window of opportunity to land a quick hits as well so that's a thing too the big thing just like with a lot of other big fights in this game is to not get greedy I know it's very hard to not get greedy but if you can avoid it you can actually do a lot of damage very slowly while keeping healthy and that's the main thing it's just a matter of outlasting his health bar another thing to keep in mind is you can Parry morogot but I generally say it's not worth it oh I rolled early there's the stab you can see that it hits you does some bleed and he throws you does a ton of damage try to avoid getting hit by that as much as possible almost out of healthier almost out of juice all right I wasn't in a very good position to land an attack there so we're just gonna roll with him on this side land a quick hit never mind [Music] how hard that is to dodge it's just so delayed that's the big thing about morga as well as Market earlier in the game he just has a lot of delayed attacks that are very hard to counteract oh my God look at these delayed attacks dude oh I'm gonna eat a spear I'm gonna eat a spear no all right we gotta try to finish this fight before he finishes us gotta play very carefully very patients very precise very good this is gonna be close stay away from the curse we could have hit him there but I didn't want to get greedy there it is it's all about the timing of the attacks at the right moment and I'm pretty sure we did see his entire move set aside from the idea where he can chain a bunch of his attacks together that's something we didn't see a whole lot of it is very possible there's there's a bunch of videos out there already where morgot will chain a lot of his attacks into one really long combo I've had it happen to me where he literally does not stop swinging his weapons for minutes at a time he just keeps going and going and going no exaggeration he will just like he has all the stamina in the world and will not stop so you have to be very careful in this fight I did I know this is not a great representation as far as skill goes but that's not the idea here I wanted to show off his move sets and the best moments to attack him in between his moves and there it is the remembrance of the omen King as well very cool fight one of my personal favorite in the entire game now I'm out of here for now guys I hope this video does help you I know it wasn't very clean but it did get the point across anyways thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

Title: How To Defeat Fire Giant - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: tzwsy8AqW34
Transcript Text:
hey everyone welcome for another Elden ring boss guy at this time we're talking about fire Giants in the mountaintops The Mountaintop area is this boss is legendary and you find it right here in the Southeast area of the mountaintops just before uh you know the the big the burning burning cauldron up there so this boss fight is legendary for being a very big gatekeeper for people to continue on to further areas in Elden ring so in this video I'm going to talk about my strategy and taking this down now let's get started and while we're getting started I'm going to talk about my strategies the biggest thing that you need to do is focus on the Giant's left leg during phase one when you get close you'll realize that you you can see a bit of a a hair a hair splint around its leg that's its weak spot during phase one you can see it from here the next thing I recommend is stay on your horse during this fights stay on your horse and bring some type of status effect if possible you want things like bleed frostbite poison Scarlet rots and I would recommend at least two of those if possible you don't have to do this but it does make the fight a lot easier if you do because the giant has very high physical damage negation now of course if you are using magic you can just kind of do your magic thing just focus on his leg just keep hitting it that's fine too but outside of that the big thing is just focusing on his left leg during phase one so I'm gonna show how I do that during phase one here you will often do this attack right here it's a bit of a wave you just need to make sure that you jump over it and then you just ride your horse into its leg and start swinging away just keep hitting that leg do not stop stay out of the way if it's attacks don't let it stomp on you don't let It smash you with the shield stay directly underneath it keep hitting its leg Until It Breaks and then just keep hitting it some more see after it breaks after you break the splint it will roll away from you and then start to cast some fire spells you just run up to it it's like some more until it walks away or starts to slam stuff again you'll see as well that there is a fire orb out there as soon as they cast the fireworks fell you can just uh you know ride away from it it's not a big deal there it is just activate it right away from it so it doesn't hit you and then as soon as you can get back underneath it again so you can keep focusing on that leg I call these the toe strats just keep hitting those toes dude give me them toes fire Giant give me them toes okay when it does it's uh AOE attack here uh you know Mega we attack you need to get get out of range and then you know activate the fire orb when you get close right away from it don't let the fire hit you the fire can do some really good damage you need to make sure you stay out of the way of it just stay underneath it at all costs now now it's going phase two this is where the fight gets hard okay I still say I still say here you focus on the toes however because it rips off its leg you have to focus on the other leg it does have a weak spot in its hand basically any part of its body that's on fire is the weak spot so it has a you know the burning hands and he has the eyeball which you can also hits but I still say go for the toes I know it seems like a a weird strategy but I promise you it works you want to stay on the horse and you want to keep riding directly underneath it stay behind it hit its toes wait for it to roll in repeats now the reason why I recommend bringing at least two elements here is so that way you can start off the second phase with a different element and then start alternating them so that way you can start applying those those Elemental effects those status effects a lot more often I did a lot of bleed during that first half so he should be very weak to frost in the second half because that's my other weapon so let's get started with this you'll see that I immediately right underneath it I equip my other weapon I start swinging away at the toe the giant will spend time casting some fire spells at the very beginning of phase two just make sure that you stay out of the way of it okay stay out of the way keep hitting those toes do not stop hitting the toes do not stop hitting toes give me those toes pretty please see how much damage I just did that was over 2000 damage in that engine just that little combo now you will see that he'll still cast the fire orbs he will roll away from you you will cast the you know projectiles but the still you just want to ride Adam get behind them hit those toes hit those toes non-stop as long as you're behind him he has a hard time rolling it here touch these Fireballs get behind them hit the toes repeats he will try to drop elbows on you and stuff like that you can just ride under him like bats hit the toes you see how he's not able to roll on top of me when I'm back there he can't hit me he just can't do it there's the big elbow drop let's apply the frostbite here should be soon there's the frostbite let's switch to our other weapon and get out of the way don't let the fire hit you now that he's frostbitten we're gonna be able to you know just make him bleed again stay behind him if you do not stay behind him he will roll on you and it will hurt he does have a lot of physical damage negation but with the status effects involved he can't do a whole lot of damage to you we repeat this cycle over and over no problem easy peasy okay here comes the fire we have these fire orbs let's get ready he's Gonna Roll we activate the fire orb there's another fire orb here activate that one get out of the way there he goes for the roll follow them here comes the projectiles we Dodge we Dodge we get behind them give me those toes baby we ride at him again when he rolls away he's gonna drop the elbow you dodge it you get underneath him give me those toes baby over and over guys do not stop hitting those toes those toes are mine baby and there you go that's fire giant made easy fire giant Made Easy we didn't take a single bit of damage during that the tow strategy is highly effective I promise you it will work as long as you stay on your horse and you keep riding and biting those toes maybe don't bite them don't be weird okay don't make it weird anyways guys I hope this video does help you you know fire giant can be tough but with the tow strats it's very easy with that said I'm out of here for now thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

Title: How To Defeat Godskin Duo - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: 0-r54PhVtFo
Transcript Text:
hello folks thank you for tuning in for another Elder ring boss guide this time we're going in on the godskin duo now on your way to down to the godskin duo or a whole bunch of banished Knights but if you fight it for the first time you can actually do the same move I'm going to do to jump into the boss room really quick to avoid them uh outside of that you do have to pass down towards the lowest level to end of the room afterwards if you do die to them so keep that in mind in this video I'm going to discuss how I defeat the godskin duo as they can be tough to manage I know this uh this boss fight specifically is either very hard or very easy depending on who you talk to but I know the majority of players that have done this fight have found it pretty difficult so we're going to discuss how I get through this the best moments to strike and what to do in those moments of uh you know the godskin noble going phase two and stuff like that with that said let's get started I'm just gonna run right down this little path here avoid the banished Knights avoid this other banished night and just run straight forward and through this now again if you do if you do die to this the next time you'll have to go all the way down to the base level and run that door right there okay so in this fight you can use sleeping arrows and sleeping pots I don't have any of them equipped myself as I want to show how to do it without it but you can put one of these guys to sleep and then uh you know focus on whichever one is not sleeping and they will stay down for a good long while so again sleeping arrows and sleeping pots are a choice as well as Saint Trina's sword if you do have that now the basic Tactics still apply with these uh with these guys you know you can fight them by parrying you can fight them by dodging you know specifically when they throw the black flame is their single weakest moments so I'd recommend if you are looking to do things by dodging or just basic combat you wait until they throw a black flame and then you run at them to get underneath it and you hit them really fast I like to focus on the godskin noble first because I do find him weaker of the two so I figure if we kind of get him out of the way it'll make things easier to really focus on the godskin noble from there I'm sorry the uh the godskin apostle from there all right so now that he's gone phase two it means he's Gonna Roll at us so what I like to do is run to one of these pillars stay on the opposite side of it and just watch him do his thing sometimes the godskin Apostle will attack you as you can see here he's gonna throw some stuff at me but I just kind of wait out the Roll by watching him roll into this pillar once that's done we're free to go go back into fighting him as we normally would [Music] okay we avoid that damage there [Music] a lot of people will tell you that they'll only fight you one at a time but that's simply not true as you can see they're both attacking me at the same moments they just have their own different movesets that they'll pull off all the while the same Stat or the you know the same rules apply to fighting them just make sure you try to single one of them out so that way you can focus the other completely solo that's the ticket here all right there's helicopter mode let's take a moment to heal up now after a couple of moments you'll see as well that the uh whichever one you kill second or the one the one that you're attacking second rather will eventually stop to summon the other one as you can see right here in that moment you can basically just run up to it and hit him for a whole bunch of damage now not every weapon or you know damage type in the game is going to be able to destroy them as quickly as that's I am using frostbite and bleed at the same time which definitely helps with that because I'm you know basically doubling up the status effects here but once you get through that one if you do kill it quick enough you'll be able to focus on the godskin noble uh basically solo which makes the fight a lot easier [Music] as long as you're keeping busy as well he'll avoid summoning for a while too so you want to just try to really do as much damage as you possibly can keep in mind though that after a few moments he will summon his friend again so you need to make sure that you're aware of that as you can see he's doing that right now so I'm just doing everything that I can to destroy him and there he goes now again if you do have to end up fighting two at a time I do recommend using sleep if you want to so that way you can kind of get one of them out of the way but outside of that the same rules apply all the while just run out that when they throw the fire hit them back off repeat that cycle until they're both dead that is the simplest way to take them out overall it's really not that but of a fight as long as you focus on one at a time if you do get caught up in the moment where they're both attacking you at the same time there's no shame in just running away and of course the same rule applies as with most bosses in the game if you are using projectiles whether it be Magic based or arrows they will get much more aggressive so keep that in mind if you are launching projectiles they'll do everything they can to close that Gap and throw more Fireballs at you so keep that in mind as well as with most of the game of Elven ring anyways guys thank you so much for watching the video I hope this does help you thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you

Title: How To Defeat Dragonlord Placidusax - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: rRARX8vtIAk
Transcript Text:
hey everyone thank you for tuning in for another Elden ring boss guide video this time we're talking about placidusacks a very powerful Dragon and also can be a very difficult fight in this video we're going to discuss the move set of placidus ax as well as how to counter-attack and the right moments to do so now keep in mind that placidusax is not completely immune to any status effects I'll be using bleed and Frostbite myself to try to amplify as much damage as possible the big attacks you need to look out for against Placido sacks are you know very very basic things like fire breath uh you know the Ancient Dragon Lightning he also has a couple of very special moves where he flies around and crashes really hard on the ground he actually goes invisible and teleports and stuff like that but if you watch closely at how I do this fight you'll be able to do this too now keep in mind as well that placidusex actually does not have very high Poise so if you can hit him a lot in a small window of time he can knock him down and get heavy Critical Hits on its heads too I say heads because it has two heads originally five heads but in this fight it has two but uh overall this fight can be both exhilarating and difficult at the same time but hopefully I can make this look as easy as possible for you guys so that way you can find the right moments to make you know make the the attacks yourself hopefully this video can help you out I really enjoy this cutscene as well this is so cool there he is plastic Deuce ax [Music] beautiful beautiful you can see that he has two heads but he originally had five originally had five heads you can see that he has three necks on him without any heads on them I can only imagine what this fight would be like if he had all five all right let's get this thing started I'm going to go ahead and start running up to him but then I'm gonna use sapuku so I can get some bleed this is actually my very first playthrough ever doing like this level of bleed stuff and it's been a good time actually I can see why a lot of people use this the damage you can do is pretty surreal you can see that placidus ax will immediately scream into the sky and start causing Dragon Lightning to rain down on you basically it'll happen four times the very beginning of the fight at twice already and now we just keep running away from it and between these moments I like to run up and hit his leg but be careful because the wing can grab you there okay that ability right there is Bolt of grand sacks I've never actually seen him use it this early before whenever you hear that attack happen or when you see the the Ancient Dragon Lightning version of the bolt hit the ground you need to run outside of the area of it immediately it can do pretty big damage I don't think it'll ever outright kill you but it can do some really big damage really fast they can see that at the beginning of the fight here I'm basically just focusing on its tail because it's right next to me he'll often tail whip and turn around at you if you're close enough you can land a big hits and then you want to dodge the claw and then immediately run to the left around his right side and go for the tail again to get out of range of the fire and then you can hit the tail some more you will be out of the range of the uh the fire breath at that point so you're just free to swing away it will tail whip again and then you could probably repeat this same cycle foreign Dragon Lightning again because he did the roar that'll happen every time he Roars so keep that in mind basically just wait for the lightning to rain down move out of the way of it stay away from the claws Dodge The Rock sling and then getting close for another Savile of attacks you will see as well once you get them to about two-thirds to 50 Health he'll basically fly away this is where he enters phase two of the fights this is when he starts teleporting around and flying at you luckily I have frostbite on them so I can see where he's going but once you see the dragon lightning in the sky you can actually lock onto him whenever he does the dive at you you want to dodge towards him and after he lands on the ground he'll basically just keep teleporting around swinging his claws at you you can land attacks in between just watch out for the jump sometimes he does that as well there's another claw attack but we're able to dodge it land a couple more hits on him we landed a big bleed a little greedy but it's fine it was worth that damage and now he's down below a third of health and now he's teleporting away he's gonna fly over there and he's gonna crash in the ground at us again we want to dodge towards him right at the last seconds so that way you don't get hit by it and then you immediately run towards him again this is where the fight can get a little finicky at this moment he'll start teleporting a lot more often hitting you with a dragon claws really doing a lot of incredibly large damage you just got to be very careful to stay away from the Dragon Lightning part of it that's the that's the damage that you want do not want to get hit by as you can see it's taking over half my health every single time it hits there's the wing attack careful because the wing does crash on the ground and then he flings rocks me to avoid that damage [Music] there's that Dragon Lightning again [Music] it hits so hard and can be difficult to dodge but it is possible you just got to be very diligent about it try to get to a side land some hits watch out for the dragon breath I wasn't if you are standing by his leg you'll often see that the dragon breath there will actually miss okay here's the Ancient Dragon Lightning again Dodge out of the way of bats now it gets real now it's raining Dragon lightning while he's teleporting around trying to fly at you it can be really hard to spot him but as long as you do spot him you'll be able to dodge towards them and miss and now we have dragon laser beams after he does that basically you just want to dodge at the very last second as it crosses your path and then just run to the right if you run to the right after it crosses your path it generally will never hit you that's the best way to dodge the dragon the dragon lasers as I call them and now it just gets crazy where it keeps flying around at you he just you know he's really desperate to try to take you out and he doesn't give you a whole lot of opportunity to actually get next to him but he will slow down eventually and then that's when you just need to really focus on finishing him off in that manner I'm gonna go ahead and seppuku here and we're gonna focus on killing him now there we go oh it still hit me unfortunate let's drink some juice all right there's the both of grand sacks again we need to run far far away one of the coolest animations of the whole game right there but it is easy to get out of the way of so keep that in mind just run away from them and then get in there and land all your damage as quickly as possible watch the tail whip keep hitting him here comes the dragon claw we Dodge we run around his right side which is our left straight to the tail and keep hitting it and this should kill him off right here you can see how the fire just barely missed me that's because once you get to this portion of the tail it's just completely out of range and there we go there's dragonlord placidus ax now we did see almost his entire move set there I think he has one or two moves that we didn't see but the big thing is though with a couple moves that he didn't use are very non-consequential they're just basic attacks they're basically just him swiping his claws at you you've fought many dragons before at this point in the game so you should know how to dodge Dragon claws as well the big thing with placidusacks just like a lot of other major bosses in this game is just really focusing on dodging at the right time and counter-attacking try not to be greedy it's very easy to just kind of ignore the fire like I did at one point I didn't get behind his leg if I was behind his back leg the fire wouldn't have hit me so positioning in this fight is very key try to pay attention to that attack him in between his own Combos and just be diligent about all of it a lot of his moves do devastating damage as you saw the Dragon Lightning specifically is insanely powerful it took half my life every single time so just be diligent Dodge at the right moments counter-attack where possible and I do recommend trying to use things like bleed frostbite Scarlet rot and poison to just slowly dwindle his life down with that extra little bit of damage that you can get on him anyways guys I hope this video does help you thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

guided through and how to get this item this item will specifically help you defeat malacath it's the single item in the game that allows you to Parry his Black Blade as you can see deflects the power of the Black Blade in this video I'll be discussing the right moments to Parry him you'll see his blade glow a bright yellow or gold color and then when he swings it at you you can Parry by tapping the button at that moment just like you would for any other Parry in the game and then he'll give you a couple moments to attack outside of that we'll be discussing his moveset how to avoid most of his moves or all of his moves the best that we can and then go on from there so let's start off with the Beast clergyman also known as garak whenever you see him stab his hand into the ground like that you need to basically be ready for a huge Beast claw attack to come out at you it has two versions you saw that one right there where it's basically a 360 version of it it goes out in all directions you can just jump over and attack him he has another version of his wealth and I'm sure we'll see on this fight where basically he'll you know send a wave out towards you and at that moment you can uh you know just jump or Dodge through it as well and land a nice attack on him too here's this you should send the wave out at me we jump it we land we hit him we roll we back away this attack right here where he drags his dagger on the ground is also a big opportunity to land the hits make sure you make the most of that too and then from there it's mostly just about dodging his dagger and the rocks with that Boulder attack right there if you are close enough you can land a good hit as well but if it is on the grittier side so I do recommend you know playing it safer but if you are comfortable with it feel free to land a quick hit there too my recommendation in general though when he swings his dagger is not to attack him in the middle of his combo I recommend just playing it on the safer side on the air side you know that way you're not getting hits just focus on really dodging his abilities because you're going to need most of your health for the second part of the fight but here's the greenier part that I mentioned right there you can land a hit him with you know with the boulder attack there if you do it right you can see there that I jumped a little early unfortunately but that's okay make sure that when he's sending projectiles at you that you're rolling forward or to the left or right do not roll backwards as that increases the amount of damage frames and you know the number of hit frames I should say you want to make sure that's as small as possible you can see how I'm not attacking him in between his own attacks I'm just playing it safe waiting for the right moments thinking of right moments there's one now we jump we attack we Dodge I had to dodge backwards there but it's okay it didn't hit us here's this attack again we hit him again we back up nice and safe nice and safe guys thank you this is a radio attack but it worked out for us very good he's gonna send out the wave at me we jump last second we run in for the hits we Dodge I dodged a little early unfortunately but that's the idea that you want to do right there now if you can help it before he does become malachev I try to recommend uh taking cover behind a pillar and maxing out your health so that way when he does turn into malacath you do have a full health bar ready to go let's run in tap him once here's his big AOE attack basically he just sends a bunch of rocks flying keep in mind that they do crash down on the ground as well let's roll through that time just to show it can be rolled roll that hit him again and now it's phase two let's go ahead and get phase two started here this is where the fight gets real this is where you need to learn how to Parry with the Blasphemous claw if you do habits as you can see I am just trying to uh stick close to him here if you do stick close to his back legs you can land a lot of damage as well just be aware that he can do this sometimes when he does slam his blade into the ground you know at the very tip he's gonna do that huge AOE you need to make sure that you avoid that if possible by Rolling behind him that's how you avoid that attack outside of that he'll basically do a lot of these jump attacks with a lot of explosions and then he'll jump around and he'll send waves of things at you and now let's show off how to Parry him whenever his blade glows yellow that's when you parry right there see how his blade was yellow there we'll show it again in this fight before we end it you can see that he swings around his weapon still you need to be very careful of that play it safe try not to get overly greedy hit him a few times and back right off when he does these basic attacks you can land some hits like so here's this attack again with the roll behind him unfortunately I got caught on him so I didn't get to heal properly but we can take a moment to heal so it's okay let's wait for the Perry again the big attack that you'll note is he'll be able to jump on a pillar and then he'll make his weapon glow and slam on the ground you can Parry just before the landing or you'll see that he sends out the waves of the Rune of death you'll have to dodge two or three times and he changes it up on you most of the time it's three but sometimes he'll do it twice so be aware when his blade glows yellow that's when you need to get ready for the Parry here it comes get ready you get ready oh I missed it you see how the blade was yellow though that's exactly what you need to look out for that's how you parry him outside of that if you're not trying to Parry him you just need to stick close to his back legs stick close to his back legs and hit him in between his own swings and you'll do just fine that's how you defeat him without the Blasphemous claw so stay close to the back legs roll out of the way of that attack you're best off going to put behind him or to the side of him do not roll backwards from that attack there's the Perry once again and then you can just do all sorts of damage for free now he's almost dead already look at that you can see how the parrying is highly effective as it allows us to damage him for completely completely free if the Perry wants more and that's how you defeat malakath the Black Blade keep in mind that you you know you can go ahead and do it without the Blasphemous claw like I said you saw how I did it by just sticking close to his back legs but I wanted to show the right moments to Parry with the Blasphemous claw because just because you have the Blasphemous claw doesn't mean that the fight is going to be completely free you still have to utilize it which means you have to use the Parry just before he hits you while his blade is glowing yellow you saw how I did it after he sent out the Rune of death waves after he sends out two or three the blade glows yellow he swings it at you you hit the Parry button at that right time and then you get some free damage time with that said guys I'm out of here for now I hope this video does help you I know malakith can be tough but if you do have the rights uh the right patience you can make it work I believe in you thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

Transcript Text:
hey everyone thank you for tuning in for another Elden ring boss guide this time we're going in on worm face worm face is found here in front of this minor herb tree that you can find in Altus Plateau it takes the place of a regular Earth tree Avatar you have to be careful with this one he sprays death blight everywhere and death blight basically if the meter for death play builds all the way up you get instantly taken out no matter how much health you have it just it completely zeros you out kills you off immediately he does have some melee moves as well and as well as a very uh very constant command grab attack where basically he just keeps reaching down trying to grab you and then he'll try to eat you keep in mind that when it comes to command grabs you can spam the uh the bumpers on your controller I'm not sure what mouse and keyboard do but I do believe if you spam R1 and L1 you'll be able to break free of like the full damage of it and that's something you can do against this guy as well because it's basically small bits of damage for a long period of time that's how I've always broken out of it and it does work pretty well it does change the amount of damage you take so with that in mind we're going to try to avoid the command grab we're going to try to avoid all the Death being sprayed everywhere and uh try not to get stomped on let's do this you can see how large he is he's quite large with a big old cloak the big secret to this guy is trying to stay behind him trying to stay behind him but it can be tough because he Stomps around he tries to grab you it gets kind of uh kind of weird here's the grab shoot he's eating me all right let's spam R1 and L1 okay he did about half my health there but you see how the animation continues there it can actually do more damage if you're not careful and to dodge that you have to you basically have to dodge it at the very last second just like Eleanor of the Briar if you dodge it at the very last second then it won't hit you however keep in mind that he'll keep doing it over and over again so I've seen him do it at like five grab attempts in a row and now you can see he's just basically spraying death everywhere it gets kind of gross and builds up death play extremely fast over a wide field there's that grab again let's do some jump attacks land our damage and get out that's the big thing you just don't want him to try to to to grab you you see how he's grabbing over and over that was three grab attempts in a row there Stomps he tries to smash his head on the ground he's puking blood you know death stuff everywhere I think it's just kind of gross but as you can see as long as you can stay just behind his legs you're able to land a lot of damage without much without too much risk he does walk backwards but if you can manage to stay behind while you're swinging your weapons you'll be able to uh to get through him in no time luckily he doesn't have a whole lot of health so there is that as well and another tip for this would be if you do have a heavier weapon if you do a lot of jump R2 attacks you'll be able to stagger him actually pretty easily he doesn't have a whole lot of poise because he's not armored and if you can get a critical hit on him it does extra damage because their heads are particularly weak to physical damage or at least that's what it seems like because they take a lot of extra damage anyways that's it for this video I hope this video does help you thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

Title: How To Defeat Draconic Tree Sentinel - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: Ksp6ohn0ses
Transcript Text:
hey everyone thank you for tuning in for another Elden ring boss guy this time we're talking about the dragon the draconic tree Sentinel rather this has taken me a few tries because I keep getting tripped up by one of his attacks and I'll talk about that attack one week when we see for the first time you do find this first one here just to the northeast of Langdale looking at the back entrance one of the couple ways you can get into Lane now and then there's another one on the Great Bridge in farm Azula just in front of malakat's Boss room so I'm gonna open up this fight with a bit of a a bit of an introduction to a cheese strap but I will not be cheesing it myself I'll just be talking about how you can do it and then we're going to talk about the rest of his moves how I avoid them and how I counter attack with that said let's get started what you can do is if you don't alert him you can actually run around the left side here go around this side here through the trees and brushes or bushes do not jump because he will see you and hear you we want to do is just walk through get behind him nice and slow and steady and then if you're standing right behind him you can cast poisonous Mist on him repeatedly it will poison him he will never turn around and look at you and it will kill him slowly over time so that is a way you can cheese him if you are using poison mist outside of that you need to make sure that uh if you are trying to do something like cheesy from behind you have to make sure that it doesn't do any physical damage that would alert him that means you can't use like rot you know Dragon rot breath and stuff like that because those do apply physical damage so keep that in mind keep that in mind so what we're going to do is I'm going to open this up with a couple of bloody slashes and then he's going to counter attack with either his shield fire or his club and we'll just kind of Dodge out of the way and talk about the rest of his moves from there let's get started foreign this is good we just landed 16 91 damage that's solid you grab my runes now you can see the fire does track with the fire from the horse we need to make sure that you dodge forward or to the left or to the right never Dodge backwards as it will hit the ground behind you and it will hit you for extra damage so you need to make sure that you're dodging forward left or right only with the fire now when he jumps at you and swings his Club I like to go to his shield side afterward and then he'll actually swing his shield at you sometimes he'll swing it several times other times he'll swing it once and then just you know jump away or you know he'll follow it up with a with another uh potential shield attack okay this is the hardest part of the fight right here when he does the Dragon Lightning stuff you can see that you have to dodge it at the very last seconds if you dodge too early or too late there are several lightning bolts there that will all hit you you need to make sure that you dodge at the very last moment possible you'll see as well now his Club is imbued with Ancient Dragon Lightning so you need to make sure that you dodge his damage even more so because now he's doing extra melee damage with it there will be a point where he will basically charge up a giant electric wave and send it at you you want to make sure that you dodge forward through it only forward do not Dodge left right or backward here's his attack where he causes a bunch of pockets of Dragon Lightning as well you can just stay out of the way of that that's pretty easy I'm waiting for him to do the dragon wave so I can talk about how to counter that specifically basically he'll jump at you he'll charge up the wave that's not it at all do the thing man [Music] do the thing man [Music] do it guys he's not doing it we have seen the majority of his moveset now though so there is that so basically the same rule applies when he goes phase two you want to uh try to find a window of opportunity to go Shield side and hitch hit him melee on that side only do not try to melee him when on the on his right side which is our left if you do that he'll likely just hit you with the club and do a ton of damage okay here's the wave I actually rolled sideways and somehow didn't get hits but basically if you dodge that you need to back up immediately because then he does a giant ground pound that casts a very wide Arc of lightning all around him if you get hit by that lightning from the first wave you'll likely get hit by the ground pound and both have a lot of frames that do a lot of damage that's actually um this is my third take of this video now and that killed me twice and be very careful all right stay stay Shield side mainly him there comes the lightning again outside of that you can just go on from there and finish the fight however you please if you are a mage a spellcaster of any kind you can basically just Spam your spells in between his attacks and you'll never have to worry about much you can see that if you stay Shield side though it's very easy to attack him Dodge his shield and attack him again as long as he doesn't jump away you can land a bunch of damage that way those are your biggest moments of opportunity to land damage as a Melee character an ulterior Center ulterior an alternate thing you can do you can fight them from horseback however I don't like fighting him from horseback because the Fireballs do track a little bit as well as the uh the Dragon Lightning that he casts is basically instantaneous and will hit you from the horseback as well so I just prefer to fight him on foot to make that a little bit easier to dodge there's the wave we need to back up immediately we Dodge that now once the lightning is done you can run in and land a quick hit as well here comes more lightning Pockets avoid all bats this is very much so a battle of endurance you see how I'm landing all this damage from Shield side and you just keep swaying away he gets pretty greedy sometimes where you can just keep hitting him over and over again it's pretty nice I like when that happens here comes the lightning again Dodge that at the very last second every single time if you dodge earlier late it will do big damage all right here he comes the Dodge we go Shield side we Dodge [Music] you can also move up on him during moments like this as well I just prefer not to because it makes him a little bit unpredictable as well as when he casts that as well he uses it to pretty much scare you away so I just prefer to stay back wait for him to charge to me so that way if it's on his terms oh shoot it's might kill me I dodged it you can see that it has a lot of frames and you have to dodge it very precisely just like that attack there it's very difficult to dodge you also find that the wave that he sends out can be pretty difficult to dodge just because it's uh it has a weird like depth perception thing going on with it are you scaring us away with that so let's back up Fireball I saw that a little late I've done this fight many times and even now I still find it difficult so that's something to keep in mind as well even experienced players will get hit by this stuff very often just something to keep in mind so if you do find this fight frustrating you know just just know that it's normal okay but anyways he's down now he gave us a moment of opportunity to finish him off so we're good you'll see here that he does drop 50 000 runes as well which at this point is basically a free level so that's cool then you get the dragon claw and the Dragon shield so you can cosplay ASM if you'd like the one over in farm Azula will drop the draconic tree Sentinel armor set so if you want to really be the whole set you can get the entire set by defeating both of them in the game anyways folks I'm out of here for now thank you for tuning in and thank you for liking commenting and subscribing I hope this video helps you defeat him and I'll see you soon for more

Title: How To Defeat Crucible Knight Duo (Ordovis) - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: AquFQvCeqW8
Transcript Text:
hey everyone thank you for tuning in for another boss guide in Elden ring this time we're going in on The Crucible night Duo that you find here not there but here in oriza Hero's grave which is just on the northeast side of Langdale there are two Crucible nights in here including a named one named or dovis he is the uh he's the one responsible for dropping the sword if you want The Crucible knight sword this is where you need to go now keep in mind there is another Crucible Knight in here but with a spear I'm going to talk about how I defeat both of these and how I manage the fight all the while and I'll be narrating it while I do while I do it the main thing that I do for the majority of this fight is parrying I find Crucible Knights rather easy to Parry both sword and Spears uh variants I'm able to Parry them on the regular and so that's what we're going to be focusing on in this fights so with that said let's get started the big key to this fight is basically just trying to find opportunity to make sure that you can land attacks on one of them my big advice is to focus on one or the other and whichever one you're not focusing on you need to completely ignore the other one as far as damage goes let's walk up let's Parry I always take out the unnamed one with the spear first and then I just basically move out of the way resets and wait for another window of opportunity to go in on the one with the spear you'll see that ordovis can be highly aggressive he's definitely the higher uh the more aggressive one out of the two but as long as you can find a window to go in on the one with the you know the spear like so you just Parry him stab him back up now you can do this without pairing as well you can it's just this is my preferred method to do so as it allows us to you know Parry him repos and when we are reposting when we're stabbing him we basically get some iframes so the other one cannot hurt us you can see that as long as you wash the hands never watch the weapons when you're parrying always watch the hands as soon as the hand starts going towards you that's the moment that you parry outside of that you just need to make sure you keep your distance find the right moment to Parry hit him oh I messed that up I swung a little too soon I panicked a little bit you can just kind of go from there now what I'm going to do is show how I do this same thing but without parrying as soon as I get this first Crucible Knight to half health so it goes phase two when you do get the first Crucible Knight to half Health you're gonna find it very difficult to Parry him at that point because their moveset kind of changes specifically the one with the spear will not really try to hit you with the spear too often at that point so you want to make sure that you're able to uh you know learn how to fight them by dodging as well it's very important that you do so it might go phase two here let's see how this goes there's phase two nope yep there it is now with phase two this Crucible Knight will start jumping around it'll start throwing the spear at you it'll do a diving attack on you what you want to wait for is the diving attack if you can hit him right after they dive at you that's gonna be your window of opportunity to land some damage so let's focus on that idea here it comes We Roll backward I run forward I hit him a couple times I back up now keep in mind when they go phase two they do gain new moves including that uh the The Crucible horn there and they can also throw the spear here you just need to dodge to the side of that so it doesn't hit you never Dodge projectile moves like that backward as increases the amount of hit frames and from there you just keep waiting for uh specifically the the dive from the spear wielding Crucible Knight whenever it does the dive you're able to dodge backwards and then run at it or you can actually Dodge at the right moment to get behind it and land a couple attacks that way too another option for you I'll show you what I mean on the next one when we have the opportunity to do so the biggest difficulty in this fight is just managing both of these guys so as you can see the best thing you can do is just try to maintain your distance just keep running away from the one you're not focusing on he just did the very rare uh stab with the spear during phase two it was pretty rare he might do it again here too that's weird we're just trying to wait out the dive that's what we want here come on do the dive man no if you are close enough when they do this you can actually run in for a quick attack there they need to make sure that ordovis is not ready to uh meet you with his sword unfortunately I was a little bit close oh that sword has a lot of range foreign that horn as it does a lot of damage there's the rare spear strike ifordova's is at distance from you you can actually land a quick attack there too but I generally still just kind of prefer waiting for his dive move you can see that this fight is mostly about patience it is very much so a fight of endurance you just have to outlast these guys focus on learning how to dodge their move sets I do have another Crucible night guide that I put on my channel as well so if you need to check that out to learn how to dodge the sword moves I would recommend checking that out too that video will definitely highlight more so of how to fight where dovis oh boy Ordo is angry you see what I mean how it's a fight of endurance though where it's just the one that you're you end up choosing to focus on is so passive you can very much so go in on or dovis first instead of the regular Crucible Knight but I still prefer to go on the one with the spear just because the ordovus is a little bit more um he requires a little bit more attention during his his melee bouts so we're just finding quick moments to strike where possible I'm not able to swing there because ordovus is hugging him the big key is just finding a moment where they're separate from one another and then you walk in you swing you back off don't get greedy do not get greedy greed will definitely finish you off quickly in this fight because Crucible Knights do not hit lightly foreign it is a bit of a lengthy fight but the big key is is once you defeat one the other one will go a lot quicker as well so that does have its added benefit there they're a little bit too close to each other even after that dive so I have to back off this is a moment of strike because ordova stepped away you got to take advantage of those opportunities where we can okay the first one is down and now we can focus on ordovis and you guys know me when it comes to fighting The Crucible knights we just Parry away I'll get him to phase two and I'll show off a couple moments of where you can uh Dodge his tail as a lot of people do have a difficulty dodging the tail and then Landing counter attacks again you can find that more so in my other Crucible Knight guide I would recommend checking that out as I go more in depth on that but I'll show it a little bit in this video as well once we get him to phase two we just keep the Perrys going foreign we just keep the Perry train alive very good he might go phase two here again you always know when they go phase two because they'll stomp on the ground with a golden holy explosion and grow some wings fail to roll that properly but you can both roll that and jump it never roll backward against that attack always roll to the side or forward through it let's get him down to half Health here and now we're gonna focus on how to counter attack him by Rolling only you'll see that he'll start swinging a tail at you after his uh his combos or he'll fly at you like that either way when you see the tail you need to make sure that you know the right moment to dodge it oh this is his Ash of war attack that's the that's the ash of War specifically on that sword you can just kinda you know step away from it don't walk towards it just walk away it gives you a lot of you know a lot of lead time just step backwards away from it do not get hit do not get hit [Music] we Dodge his attacks he swings the tail we land a quick Counter-Strike we back off it's slow but it's still possible back away from the ash of War he's gonna fly at me now he will do the tail attack after he flies sometimes too and it does have the double swing so keep that in mind we Dodge we Dodge stay away from that Madness Shield strike maybe looks like a shield strike to me no Ash of War again my dude come on give me the tail No More Wings my dude I need you to show me the tail so I can show how to counter attack again swing oh my God he's very into the wings today he's very into the wings Shield strike tail strike counter attack back off tail strike Dodge Dodge back up from the ash of War Stomp Dodge tail strike counter attack jump it's a bit like a dance you just gotta be very very patient very accurate with your dodges we Dodge he Wings it we jump it we walk towards him he's going to do the double tail if you get close enough after the double tail strike just like that you can land a good counter attack there too so if he does fly and you don't get hit by it or try getting up on him like that it's a good opportunity to land some extra damage you know in a very otherwise slow fight you can also lure out a moment right there if you're close enough during that short slam you can land a quick attack there too though that one I would say uh only do that if you feel extremely comfortable see there's another moment to attack there's the ash of War but now that we've seen his entire move set let's finish off or dovis we've had enough of him it's time for him to go to sleep we back up let him recover he's gonna stop he's gonna sword strike us but he fails because we parried we stab him again now again you can do the whole Dodge thing as well you're not required to Parry in this fight it's just something that uh I find makes it a little bit easier is all but it is completely possible to defeat him with only dodging as well with that said or dovis and the other Crucible Knight are now dead we have the great sword and The Crucible ax sets very nice anyways guys I hope this video does help you thank you for tuning in for it thank you for leaving a like thank you for

Title: How To Defeat Tree Sentinel Duo - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: xdOyYU0ZBSI
Transcript Text:
hey everyone thank you for tuning in for another eldering boss guide this time we're talking about the tree Sentinel Duo that you can find just in front of the gates to Langdale you can see the first one over there and the other one is on the right side over there so what we're going to do is discuss my tactics with this fight it is very similar to fighting you know the very first tree Sentinel of the game but these ones have more health and also if you do this right you only have to fight one at a time instead of two at a time which a lot of people end up having to do so I'm going to show you how to make that work and move on with the rest of the fight now I do recommend that you don't go up this stairway here it is possible to just charge up the stairway here and fight them um and you can charge right through the doors and hit the sight of Grace back here and be safe if you choose to do that but either way you can either do that and get behind them here or you have you can go all the way around here through this pathing that I'm highlighting and get behind them that way this door over here is open so you can just kind of go on this way too that's what I usually do because it gives me you know time to clear out all the stuff up here so either way you want to make sure that you start this fight from behind them you want to attack them from the inner side of the walls here to make this work so what you want to do is just casually stroll your way out here but don't let them see you don't let them see you walk towards the one on the left and when you do you'll start to walk away I still don't know why he does this it's never really made sense to me but he just kind of walks away you see him go now you need to make you need to make sure that you do walk towards this one a little bit faster otherwise he'll walk away as well see how we started to go once the other one starts to walk down the stairs you can just initiate the fight with the first one here something to keep in mind is this one does have a torch instead of a shield so its moves are going to be a little bit different than the one with the shield but outside of that it's you know more of the same stuff otherwise so you want to just kind of hit them in the same moments that you would and the other tree Sentinel in the game just kind of take your time with it take it at your own pace there is no rush and something else to keep in mind is you will not gain wounds from killing this first one until they're both dead so you will not get runes until they're both dead and if you do die then the one that you did Kill will respawn as well I believe so keep that in mind you do have to kill them both to be rewarded I just like to wait for the same moment over and over where they do the leap attack at you and then uh you know they'll try to scoop the Halbert up at you and you can find a great moment of opportunity to land a lot of damage there it's right here is really great just land all sorts of damage there can counter attack on a lot of the swings like so too but you don't want to be overly greedy you just want to kind of take your time to go with the you know the pace that makes sense for you we got a nice knock down there and then a frost bite Brock that's huge we Dodge we Dodge the scoop we finish them off GG notice how the first one dies and we do not get any runes for it again we have to kill them both however if you do this tactic you can fight them one at a time now you can use torrent during this fight as well but again when it comes to fights like this I prefer to not use torrents as you know being able to manually Dodge these attacks is much easier than trying to avoid the length of that halberd with a horse so you can just kind of walk up on this one get a couple free hits in watch the swing after the quick rear back animation there now this is the one with the shield so if you fought the one earlier in the game over in Lim grave it has the same exact move set so if you fought that one and you know how to kill this one already this one just has a little more Health to it as all I got hit sad boy hours that sword that's a horse nudge I do like to fight it here on this flat part as well I don't want to fight out on the stairs fighting on the stairs causes a lot of weird a lot of weird like hitboxes and stuff like that because you know it being at an angle it just changes the app changes the area that you're having to dodge and so I prefer to keep it on the flatter part of the stairwell if you do need a more in-depth guide of how to individually fight tree Sentinels I do have a couple videos on tree Sentinels already on my channel consider checking those out you just kind of want to do the same thing that you would with those guys and so that video explains more in detail of how to fight them if you can fight them at a lower level earlier on the game you can fight this one too for sure he's got to find those same moments of opportunity just like that one wait for it to do the leaping attack most of the time sometimes if it's doing like a standstill swing you can find a good moment to counter attack there right uh the right animation there but we're still able to find some opportunities to land some damage so that's okay that that nudge always gets me avoid the stab avoid zap business I dodged early it's fine let's heal up I used the wrong one that was the wrong cup of juice it's fine the big key to this fight though is just being able to fight one at a time so as long as you don't charge in all willy-nilly and you just let one walk down the stairs you're able to just kind of walk up to the other one fight it off and then go ahead and finish the other one off a little bit later nothing wrong with that tactic at all you're just using the uh the opportunity that the environment gives you okay here's the leap very good man he won't do the scoop attack unfortunately that's what I need him to do glad we timed that Dodge well oh I rolled early he's a big fan of the shield right now isn't he foreign yeah he's really into the shield attack right now it's fine there you go there you go oh yeah we need to feed that one you also get the archery great Shield which is actually a really fun Shield to use that counters magic very well and blasts the blast the magic back but turns it into holy damage so it's pretty cool to use anyways guys I hope this video does help you the main tactic again is just separating them so you can fight them one at a time if you can do that I'm sure you can handle the rest of the fight because you've already killed one at this point in the game anyways folks I'm out of here for now thank you for tuning in for another boss guide an Elden ring and hope to see you soon for more

Title: How To Defeat Godskin Noble - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: tKNoB06sJ5w
Transcript Text:
hey everyone thank you for tuning in for another Elden ring boss guide this time we're talking about God skin Nobles you can encounter one here at the volcano Manor that's where we are right now myself right here all in this lava hell hole here we're gonna be taking on a very first godskin Noble that we have come across on my current playthrough in this video I'll be discussing how to Parry them as well as how you can deal with their Phase 2 transition when they're rolling around like crazy and just kind of counter-attacking after some basic Dodges with that said let's get started what I like to do at the beginning of this fight is to clear out a lot of this stuff because when when he does turn to phase two a lot of the stuff kind of gets in the way I'm specifically breaking the stuff back here against these last two pillars as those are the ones that I end up utilizing the most to dodge the phase two rolling when he does spawn in he'll often uh either rush you or throw a fireball so there's a fireball just like the godskin Apostle when they throw a fireball if you're close enough range it'll actually go right over your head I will show you that in a moment when he throws another Fireball as well see how it goes right over our head very good so his ground pound ability right there that he'll often do is payable so keep that in mind it's very easy to time the periods and then he has another attack that's also very appariable which is basic attack right here he should do in just a moment it's just a very basic uh poke with his God skin Stitcher right here you parry that you get your post and then let's focus on learning how to dodge again the main uh the main opening that you can attack is when he throws the fireball if you throw the fireball at him you're gonna be able to uh very easily just land some damage all right here he goes phase two when he does do this you want to make sure that you run away from a little bit so that way you have some space and then what I like to do is let him roll at me and at the last second roll towards him so that way he goes through us and then we just kind of circle one of these so that way we don't get hit by him except he turned at me at the very last second either way you get the point as long as you understand that he will turn at the last seconds then you know already that you can stay away from it he only does that attack during phase two as well that huge ground pound and it's very easy to dodge it you just gotta make sure that you uh it's like the archery avatars you just roll at the last second [Music] there's another Fireball if I was closer I'd be able to capitalize on the attack there that's his big attack it's a big charge attack and it is something that you can dodge but I'm just bad at that one as well as I'm bad at dodging that belly bounce make sure you keep your health up run towards it when he does the fireball hit him a couple times back up here comes the roll again they roll towards him and we just kind of chase him around around this pole here very good who's chasing who huh is it me chasing him or him chasing me who is it when he is done with that uh with the role if you are close enough you can land a quick attack on him just make sure you back off right away we Parry that we stab him 20 points okay Here's the the big slam again roll the last seconds unlike I did [ __ ] man hit him once after the fireball we actually dodged the belly bounce for once here's another Fireball get close hit him very good there's the ground pound these are very easily parried okay now that we've got a really low Health let's just focus on dodging him for a while I'm gonna show you that there's a lot of times here you can actually get directly behind him and land a couple attacks it just takes a little bit of uh understanding the timing of his moves you see how we're constantly getting behind him into his side this is this is uh a lot of time for you as a player to land a lot of damage so you want to make sure that you really capitalize on that if possible all right let's just kind of run around like a dummy here I'm losing grip on my left analog stick that's kind of scary and that's how I kind of deal with that attack here's another Fireball if we're closer we can land some hits on them [Music] we Dodge this we Dodge the ground smash that's periable as well he does that poke like right there if you're far enough away you don't have to worry about getting hit by it but what I do recommend to dodge the flurry there is to actually Dodge to your right side or his left you can see that there's just a lot of opportunity you can find yourself if you dodge that right there you can land a few attacks too we're really just finding a lot of opportunities of uh attack here there's just there's a lot of opportunities here so just make the most of it anyways with that said let's go ahead and finish them off guys I think that kind of shows off the point that I'm trying to make here there are a lot of Windows here in which you can attack him you just need to make the most of it as an individual player oh he's getting weird these pillars are making him weird it's fine though anyways [Music] GG anyways you do get the godskin stitcher and Noble presence there Noble presence is the belly bounce and the godskin stitcher is his uh thrusting sword I hope this video does help you and you can see that the godskin Nobles they have they have even more opportunities to attack them than God skin Apostles do I find them to be much easier than the apostles in general so if you can take a lot of moments in between their attacks right there to attack them you'll find that they're a lot easier too I'm sure with that said I'm out of here for now thank you for

Title: How To Defeat Regal Ancestor Spirit - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: sYEv4Kbfc64
Transcript Text:
hey folks thank you for tuning in for another Elden ring boss guide this time we're going in on the Regal ancestor Spirits now there are two different versions of this you have the Regal ancestor spirits and then you have the regular ancestor Spirits I didn't do a guide for the ancestor Spirit as this one has the same exact move set as that one except plus a couple more because it is the stronger variant of the two so I figure if you can handle this one or if you're watching this video it does cover the the weaker variants as well so this is basically a giant deer or moose or no it's not a moose it's just it's a it's a giant uh Undead deer yeah the biggest thing that the Regal ancestor Spirit can do is it actually heals by sucking up The Souls of a bunch of other spirit animals in the arena that it's in so what we're gonna do is kind of show that off show how much it can heal and what we can do to try to mitigate that as much as possible I do recommend taking in some elements into this fight so that way you can have a better time of actually mitigating its Health as much as possible things like Scarlet raw and poison are highly effective here but also Frost and bleed can go a long way too it does have a fair resistance to a lot of this stuff but it doesn't mean that it's not useful here now this uh this boss you'll see does spray a lot of like blue Spirit magic everywhere as well as has a bunch of hops like this when it does hop around you want to make sure that you're just kind of getting out of the way don't let it actually slam you and watch out for the kick with the back legs roll it at the last seconds land your attacks and then get out of the way you see how I'm already destroying it health-wise okay now it's teleporting it will often teleport really far away after a few Combos and then do a bit of like a slam and stuff like that you'll see that it can charge you with its antlers like so and also do a Charged attack with the antlers like that I just ate hoofs that's not good when it does lower its head like that if you can actually land a couple hits on it it does a lot of damage okay so you can see here that it just did a whole bunch of healing and actually steals your health as well at the same time it just healed up for the majority of its health bar and it took about half of my health bar away so you can see there that it can be a little bit annoying if you're not able to mitigate that damage and that's why I recommend taking in things like Frost and bleed so that way you can mitigate as much as possible whenever it does teleport make sure you watch out for uh for the incoming attack unlike I did there as it can do a lot of damage okay now it's doing this uh hind leg jump stuff don't let it land on you it does hurt quite a bit you know just kind of Dodge out of the way you can see that this boss does give you a lot of opportunity to land attacks on it so there's really no need to highlight it just basically counter attack anytime you have a moment to be able to do so all right now it's gonna charge again I'm trying to wait for it to do its rolling attack it has this really absurd rolling attack that it does and it's really difficult to Dodge I do recommend dodging to the left or the right when it does it okay there's the charge we're gonna leave it alive for a moment here I'm gonna wait until it does this uh this rolling attack I want to show you guys so that way you know I want you to see it please do the the rolling attack please please do the roll [Music] whenever you see it's uh when its body start glowing just roll right through it it's pretty easy to dodge [Music] all right do the roll man that's not the roll that's not the roll pal come on I don't think he wants to roll today oh he's gonna heal this is fine this is fine just let him heal all right come on [Music] yes do enjoy the music of this boss fight as well it is gorgeous Eldon RNG here please roll that's not the rule I need you to roll with me dude oh you're gonna heal again that's not very nice see how I mitigated a lot of its Health there just by attacking while it was healing all right hopefully it'll roll after this next teleports I know I'm killing this very fast because I am higher level so I'm just trying to show off more of its actual moves roll at me dude here it is you want to dodge to the left to the right with this attack if you dodge forward or backward it has a much higher chance of hitting you it still hit me even though I dodged to the right there but that's what you want to do you want to take you want to dodge to the side that has the path of least resistance on that second Dodge I should have absolutely dodged to the left but I went to the right so that was my mistake but now you now that you've seen that attack you can understand what to look out for that rolling attack is definitely the worst thing about this fight outside of the healing of course anyways with that said let's finish off this fight this fight kill it through the heel there we go there you go remembrance of the Regal ancestor so that fight can be a little bit annoying based on the healing but if you can get through it if you could just mitigate it somehow with some type of status effects a burst damage and damage over time will be your biggest friend there things like poison Scarlet rot Frost and bleed are definitely the big winners here even though it does take a while to build up it is completely worth your time anyways guys I hope this video helps you thank you for tuning in for another guide of

Title: How To Defeat Dragonkin Soldier - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: hTG_K6Ob8Yg
Transcript Text:
hey everyone welcome to another Elden ring boss guide this time we're talking about dragonkin soldiers a lot of the dragonkin soldiers you'll find throughout the game are you know kind of just laying about in their own areas but I'm covering the one specifically in The Scarlet rot area the lake of rots because it does drop a very unique Katana called the dragon scale blade which has a very cool Ash of war and I just really enjoy how the weapon Works in general but I do find this one to be the toughest one in the game aside from the spirit versions that you find over a consecrated snow field so I thought it made sense to cover this one specifically now this guy can hit really hard really quickly so you need to be very careful and Dodge all the moves at the right pace I always mess it up and I'm sure I will while recording this video but that's fine we'll be able to make them the most of it now what you want to do before you do anything is right over there there's a little bit of a pedestal you want to go step on it when you do it'll raise these platforms all around it there's four of them it'll raise them out of the ground so that way you don't have to fight it in The Scarlet rot and then you can use flame cleanse me or a ball us to clear the Scarlet rot so you don't have to worry about health drain while you're fighting it with that said let's get started the main thing you need to watch out for here in this fight is that it does have a very large amount of delayed swings and Strikes as well as ground pound attacks that also do damage when he pulls his fist back out of the ground and so hopefully in this video I'm able to really highlight that idea what you want to do is basically just dodge the arms we need to make sure that when you do Dodge the arms that you dodge the back swing of it as well you'll see that it'll swing and then he'll pull the arm back as well a lot of the time I like to go for his uh his right leg which is on our left side you can see that he's just still swinging away there he just doesn't really stop swinging a lot of the time just kind of goes crazy hits the ground a lot there's the ground pound in which he was pulling his fist out of the ground and causes another big explosion that's the one you want to avoid the most that one will actually send you flying what I try to do essentially is wait for him to swing his left arm way out like this and then run for his other leg and strike it because when he's doing the uh the you know the pull out part of his hand from the ground if you're over on that side it'll often miss you that one there he just kind of does the elbow drop you need to watch out for that he's got the double hand slam right there it's fine we Dodge to the left hit the toes I know another monster in the game where we have to go for the tow strap I know there's too many of them this game should be renamed to Elden toes there's the ground pound give me that hand we run this way hit the toes again very good give me the hand wrong one here's the elbow drop we don't like elbow drops around here I don't like elbow drops that's the hand we want we want him to specifically use his left hand by sending it out like that as that gives us the biggest opportunity to strike that's the one we like the most outside of that you just need to focus on not getting hit by the elbow drops the ground pounds everything else he sends at you the claw drags and just make sure you stay out of the Scarlet rot here specifically and that's the game that's the fight now again he does drop the dragon scale blade which is a very fun Katana one of my personal favorites one of only two katanas they actually enjoy in the game dragon scale blade very nice anyways folks I do hope this video helps you thank you for commenting liking and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

Title: How To Defeat Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: 4Yn9zDKeby0
Transcript Text:
hey everyone thank you for tuning in for another Elden ring boss guide this time we're talking about electo the ringleader of all the Black Knight assassins now I'm making a black knight assassin guide based on Electro because she is the single most difficult one she is the toughest of them all being the ringleader of them and so if you can handle electo you can handle all of them in the entire game so I do recommend bringing a weapon with frost as they are weak to frost is the only element in the game I believe that they are weak to and I also recommend that you bring a Parry capable weapon if you are parrying at all if you know how to Parry this is worth this is a fight that's worth parrying and if you have any Critical Strike scaling weapons you want to make sure you bring those too uh from there the biggest thing you need to look out for here are Haroon of death attacks her first one that all black knife assassins have is it sends out a wave just like reduvia instead of doing bleed damage it does ruin of death damage which means that it reduces your max health and does some physical damage over time the next attack you need to look out for that is exclusive to Electro as far as Black Knight assassins go it's like a mini version of malakith's Black Blade attack where she slams her dagger into the ground and causes a bit of a bunch of smaller Rune of death things to orbit around here around her at high speed in a sphere so you need to make sure when she charges that attack that you just get out of range I generally choose to run away from it towards the screen when I'm locked onto her but you can uh Dodge the other side of her as well I believe but I find that to be much more difficult so I'm going to show you how I take care of that fights or how I take care of that attack during this fight as well as I'm going to show you the best moments to attack her let's get started just like all other um ever jail fights you can run up and immediately land a hit or two so make sure you do that here as well I recommend charging a big attack as olecto is high speed and will generally you know Dodge out of the way after the first hit we Dodge that attack and then let's go for some Dodges here I failed already this right here when she slams her dagger into the ground is the single best moment to attack her in the entire fights there's the mini malachath move that I mentioned it's very hard to dodge but if you can get away from it then you know you save yourself a lot of strife when she runs at you she'll do one of three things she'll drag her dagger on the ground like that and then try to do like an uppercut move with it or she'll Dodge to the left or right oh and then she'll uh you know charge you from there or she will just straight up attack you like she did me there if you just straight up attacks you it'll be one of two moves and both of them are parryable so that's something to keep in mind I'm gonna try to show off more of these Parry type attacks here right there that's the one where she does a spin but there's also another one where she just kind of hits you both are periable but they have different timings you need to be careful about it again the best moments to actually attack her is when she does the jump and slam on the ground with her dagger then you can just run up and land at like 2-3 of hits on the regular I miss my Perry This attack right here that's the one where you want to land your attacks the most keep in mind she also has a command grab attack where she will basically reach back her left hand and she'll try to grab you if she does grab you she'll basically uh put you in a small uh like choke hold and stab you in the stomach and it does a lot of damage this right here to minimize the potential of getting grabbed by it you need to roll towards her so that way it minimizes the actual uh frames of it but keep that in mind roll towards her in those moments wait for the slam hit her a couple times that's your best moment right there [Music] is the Dodge to the sides we need to move out of the way run away from the mini malacath move we run in I like to land a running R2 there roll towards to minimize the command grab frames I pay it early let's heal up so that way we're full health try to keep your health above like 80 percent as much as possible because she has a lot of really strong moves that can one hit you run away from the mini malachaths running R2 roll towards the command grab now I'm gonna start showing you how to fight her um by hitting her in between her moves as well because she does have generally low Poise you can hit her in between her moves too [Music] you see how it broke her Poise there granted it was a frostbite as well so that definitely helps but you can actually hit her in between her combos too I would say that's a bit of an advanced move but it is something that you can do all the same I would recommend not for the sake of you know if you want to make through make it through the fight in the best way possible but you can see that your hits will just break her out of her her combos very very often it's just hard to actually time it because she's so fast damn I parried early again you see how it staggers her ever so slightly in the middle of her combo keep in mind that you can backstabber as well that is the thing you can do if you can get behind her in that moment I probably should have tried to backstab but I just went for the basic attack run away from the mini mallocab instead of running in for an attack I'm gonna top off my health try to keep your health above 80 if possible also at this point in the game when you get to her you should generally speaking have a good amount of vigor as well there's that attack beautiful oh oh okay so now you know the actual devastating damage that these Rune of death attacks can cause let's run away from the command grab let's heal up see how much damage over time that was doing not to mention the actual damage they did those those attacks are devastating so you need to make sure that your health is just always up I keep rolling that attack a little early I'm failing you there's a frostbite for you oh my God I'm having a hard time dodging these attacks man let's hit that Parry uh this is my 24th playthrough and I fought her at least 15 times now you can see that uh you know even with all this experience that I have against her she's just tough and so that's why I wanted to make a video on this because it just shows even experienced players can struggle with this boss fight so if you struggle with it as well there's no shame in that just understand that it's completely normal barely out of range of that land our attacks are you going for the jump okay charged R2 for you have that one ah too early on the Perry okay didn't break her out of that one that time foreign [Music] it's just a very long tough brutal fights you just want to make sure that you're making the most of every window of opportunity make sure that you have oh you know as many heels as possible going in and you need to avoid the Rune of death attacks the most they're the most devastating all right come on Oh I thought she would die with that last attack there you go so you can follow along with her when she's dancing around you can land some attacks here and there if your weapon is fast enough if you are using a heavier weapon I would not recommend trying that by the way just wait for the proper moments just make sure that when you when you do land the attacks with your heavier weapon you make the most of it even if it's just a basic hit it's worth it it's just all about timing it's all about taking your time in general and just having the uh the wherewithal to understand that it's just a very big battle of endurance you just need to outlast electo anyways guys as tough as this fight is I hope you get through it I hope this video does help thank you all for tuning in for it um thank you guys again for all the support on all my videos I really appreciate it thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

Title: How To Defeat Valiant Gargoyle Duo - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: -DX--FyNfP0
Transcript Text:
hey everyone thank you for tuning in for another Elden ring boss guide this time we're taking on the duo Gargoyles the Valiant gargoyles one has a straight sword and uh what's the other part a halberd yes and then the other one has a twin blade and an ax this fight is something that a lot of people consider extremely tough including myself I will say right away the best way to take this on is with a strike-based weapon as they have the least resistance to that or we've been doing this playthrough with with curved swords so we're gonna keep on doing that with what we have going on now the biggest thing you need to work out for here is the poison the poison not only does a good amount of damage every tick but also it does a good amount of damage over time of course at you know being poisoned to try to you know avoid it as much as possible I'm not very good at that myself but I'm gonna try to do my best in this video to show how to get away from it uh basically it has two different variants where they'll blow it at the ground and it's a big area around them like the actual gargoyle and the other one if they throw it out in a wave they blow it at the ground and it goes towards where you are so you need to make sure that you run out of the line of it from there it's a lot of just timing your attacks in between their attacks so let's see if we can uh show how to do this a little bit usually the first one is right up there it will run towards us after doing a quick sword attack it always starts off with the same sword attack I've found here we go yep there it is try to avoid getting hits nice to land a lot of jumping attacks because it's uh it lands the most damage for me you can see as well there's the poison you just need to get the heck out of the way of it don't get hit by the Home Run swing and just try to find moments to land jump attacks in between the Gargoyles attacks you will see that the other gargoyle will spawn at about 50 health of the first gargoyle so make sure that you are ready for that when it happens once this gargoyle hits 50 the other one will jump in and charge at you and from there it's a balance I would say that the main thing you want to do is focus on the first garboel just keep whittling it down as much as you can the other gargoyle is now on the way here it comes roll these attacks keep hitting just keep hitting as much as possible balance of both of them at the same time here's the second type of poison attack where you see how it comes out at me at a wave now again make sure that you focus on the first one you want to make it so you only have to fight one at a time so just keep focusing on the first gargoyle that you started to fight with as much as possible you see you will see that it will constantly run away from you and you'll have to deal with the attacks from the other one including poison and other combos with twin blades and axes we just want to find the right moments to attack the first one and get rid of it ASAP you'll see that the other one will be a little more aggressive while the first one you fought will generally be a little more passive a lot of time the game does that on purpose to try to get you to switch up your attacks so which one you're focusing on but don't let the game fool you focus on the one with lower Health First just avoid the twin blade as much as possible but also try to work as hard as you can to keep it on screen too avoid this dodge that land our attacks oh we almost got him all right the first one is down and that's going to make this fight a lot easier now I do find the one with the twin blade a lot more difficult because it also has an earthquake causing ax the twin blade attacks are very they have a lot of frames to them because it's basically two blades swinging at you at once you need to make sure that you make a choice of either going in close and dedicating to being close or just keeping your distance I choose to keep my distance and just stay away from it as much as possible if the ax however I will get underneath them and strike like crazy because I found that find the ax to be a lot easier to avoid so this is what we're doing here there's the poison we run away from it stay away from the poison don't let yourself get hits five to stop Dodge the ax land a jump attack run away from the poison and this is going to be the cycle we repeat over and over eventually it will pull out the twin blades again in which case I will you know take my distance again because I find it very annoying to melee against back here as long as you have your bathroom it has two variants of that attack where I'll do like a quick burst at close range there and then another one where it'll swing around jump in the air and then fly at you now when it flies at you you need to make sure that you dodge like I try to dodge towards it because when you dodge towards it it makes it so it minimizes the amount of frames that the Windstorm there can actually hit you with and it gets you out of the range so that way you don't have to deal with all the frames of heads see how many times he just swung that in like one second that's why I try to avoid just fighting the twin blades and try to weight the ax out as much as possible because that right there is a nightmare to me I do not like fighting against that at all so I'm just trying to wait out the ax here it comes avoid the earthquake first and then we run in and go mayway oh I didn't think that would hit me there but that's okay I'll start Landing our own attacks avoid the poison the poison is something that they will do every time you're too close to them when there's one when there's two of them they'll basically just do it no matter what the range because they can send out the wave the only time they do the wave version of it is if there's two of them I need to back off and heal avoid the earthquake we get close never mind here's the twin blades all right let's try to get in close and fight the twin blade so we can try to show how this works it is very much so like all the other attacks except you know the twin blades have a very wide range and he becomes more mobile with it he's just jumping around like crazy thing that I fear is just the storm attack right here this okay we Dodge towards him so that way we're out of range we minimize the frames run in land a good hits avoid the attacks as much as you can avoid the earthquake and now we get in close for more attacks here I find this to be much easier than the twin blade once again land our hits back off from the poison now I could be using things like bloody slash to land a lot more damage and I'm sure you have your own ashes of war and a lot of you guys will be using summons and stuff like that that will help you out a lot I like to show in my videos how to do it without that type of stuff I almost died there so that way any variables that you choose to include in your fight as well will just make the fight that much better for you another attack and there we go that is the twin or the duo Valiant gargoyles you can see as well when you win the fight you get gargoyle's Greatsword and the Gargoyles Twin Blade you can get their other weapons as well from the other gargoyles you can find in the game you find one over in Lane Dell on your way up to uh go fight uh the spirit of Godfrey and then you find another one on your way to Lane Dell out on the road which drops another weapon too anyways guys I hope this video does help you I know it's a bit messy this fight is never easy it's just there's just a lot going on here but I hope this video does help you out at least a little bit thank you for tuning in for it thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

Title: How To Defeat Lichdragon Fortissax - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: QjtncNjiRoI
Transcript Text:
hey everyone thank you for tuning in for another Elden ring boss guy this time we're going in on four to sacks which you can find while doing a fias quest down here in the deep root depths I'm not going to be talking about the quest in general just how to defeat the boss so let's get started the biggest thing about this Dragon the first thing I want you to take note of is how badass this Dragon looks okay this Dragon looks really cool just one of the coolest looking enemies in the entire game if you ask me so we take a nap with fear we go into her dreams and then we fight what is it I think Lightning Dragon Forest act or something like that ancient dragon fortisex well Lich Dragon so it's a lich Dragon which means that it does have some death spells you'll start seeing a bunch of uh death light lightning you don't want to stand in this as you can see it builds up death light you want to make sure you avoid those but the biggest thing about this Lich dragon is the Dragon Lightning of course the Dragon Lightning that goes everywhere uh ancient dragon or let's Dragon fortisacs will send out this lightning non-stop so you need to make sure you're paying attention also fire of course of course dragon has fire just avoid the breath you know very basic for a dragon fights watch out for the the very similar attacks that you'll see from lansay ax all these uh dragon claw attacks with the lightning that follows that's very similar to lansex the ground pounds all that stuff the biggest thing you need to look out for is the waves of lightning right there as well as the tail swipes the tail swipes are damning they can do a lot of damage and surprising surprisingly easy for the dragon to hit you because of the size of it so be aware of that as well and then of course when you do see your body glowing with the lightning it means that lightning is about to strike on you so you need to make sure that you are mobile and ready for it whenever the dragon Roars is when this Ancient Dragon Lightning is tracking you so be aware be ready for it do not get hit by it as it will knock you down and then of course you have the I can't remember the name of that attack but basically it can bring up two of these Spears and slam the ground with them a lot of time it'll just do one but it can do two so B be very careful about that if you can lure out the dragon breath you can go behind it and just beat up its tail for a while but be careful with a lightning like I was not there get out of the way of that one Dodge the ground slam keep rolling so the lightning doesn't hit you watch out for the fire breath you can see that in typical Dragon fashion here it just it's constantly blowing fire your way you want to make sure you avoid that because it can do a lot of damage too okay here comes another Lancet access glaive for uh you know fortisex does know that ability as well unfortunately so make sure you avoid it and then from there just uh you know basically repeat the same cycle over and over again just you know run in land those attacks where you can and run out do not let the the light the lightning hit you here [Music] unlike myself but also don't get death blighted like I'm about to as well we want to make sure you stay out of the death lights it's very easy to forget about the death light but it is very possible to just not get hit by it too just to make sure that you stay within the certain range outside of it the biggest thing is you'll find yourself forgetting about it sometimes so make sure you do pay attention to the meters on the screen here's the glaive again that was weird actually got delayed by hitting that Branch all the way up there you can see though that the the actual death blight part of this fight is not too problematic you don't see it like non-stop it's just like in different intervals of it this is very much so a fight where you need to pace yourself you can't just go in swinging your swords like crazy because you will get hit by things non-stop if you try to do that just try to land a couple attacks back off don't let the lightning track you too hard stay out of the depth lights and just repeat the cycle over and over again foreign the wind and the lightning from the wings there is a pretty terrible combo so just you know try try your best not get hit there I know it's very weird to dodge it but I was able to there so the way I see this if I can you can too this fight can get really messy really quick you'd be surprised by the amount of dragon by the amount of damage this dragon can do so just be aware of all of that and be ready for anything Dodge that at the right moment so it doesn't hit you notice how a lot of it goes over your head and then just run in keep hitting those toes we do the same toe Strat like we do with all the other dragons avoid the waves of the spear run in give me them toes Dodge the lightning finish it off and there you go Fortis ax is one of the coolest bosses in the game to me I really enjoy this fight a lot the music is great the atmosphere is amazing I mean look at all this it's very cool down here but just make sure that you know you're dodging all these different abilities there's so much going on in that fight and any of it can kill you extremely fast so you just have to pay attention to that most take your time with your attacks go at the right moment don't get greedy and just keep whittling it down by hitting the toes anyways guys I hope this video does help you I know that fight can be tough but I believe in you thank you for watching liking commenting

Title: How To Defeat Death Rite Bird - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: oqBGVkpQquM
Transcript Text:
all right guys welcome to another boss guide for Elden ring this time we're taking on one of my most feared enemies in the entire game the deathrite birds I do find the one here in the mountaintops to be the single toughest uh generally the way the scaling Works in this game by the time I personally get the consecrated snow field I don't find the one out there as tough as the one here in mountaintops I don't know how this fight's gonna go I may get uh stomped around a little bit but all the same I want to show you how I take this boss down and in my own personal fashion it is very similar to the death Birds but the death right birds have a few extra attacks which are actually really devastatingly high damage with that said let's get started be aware that these deathrite birds do a lot of frostbite damage and that's what makes them so fearsome because it is very hard to dodge there's the slam attack you can see there's a big field of uh ghost flame there the ghost flame does a lot of damage to try to stay away from it if possible watch out for the wave there my big thing here is I like to hit them in the head as much as possible oh hitting them in the head will often you know break down their Poise which allows you to just you know get some free critical strikes in now I'm not gonna lie I am not great at fighting these guys let's attack is one of the best moments to attack them though you can just dodge the uh the jump there and then hit him so that's a bit free avoid the explosion there's the stomp again here's a big moments very good let's hit you again right in the face there's the big round of ground strike another great moment to attack then you want to back off afterward the big thing is just avoiding the ghost flame if you can do that you can do a lot of great things with this fight my lock-on broke for some reason not sure why we see how the ghost flame follows you after that attack it's kind of annoying and so this fight is just it's really tough I don't have a whole lot of great advice aside from waiting for the right moments to attack in between its own attacks basically once its combos are done those are the best moments specifically when it slams The Sword when it does the command grab attack is also a great moment right there as you can see and then when it does the huge ground pound okay here's the uh death ritual spear attack you basically need to run away from the glowing parts of the ground and then roll afterward and then here's another special attack where it sends a bunch of ghost flame orbs at you a lot of them you can out range as you saw but there is just a large amount of them you need to roll out of the way of all those two avoid that wave the next big attack that this guy has is a huge AOE attack where it just basically swings its sword around for a moment and then causes a massive ghost flame explosion with a bunch of waves going everywhere it is one of the most frustrating attacks in the entirety of Elden ring I hate when it happens here it is right here let's hopefully dodge it okay we got lucky so you can see that it sends out five waves essentially and it's really annoying to figure out where the waves are going it's random I don't know of any way to tell where they're going and so I just recommend distancing yourself and hoping that it doesn't hit you it does look it goes that look like it goes out in a pentagon fashion but I mean it seems like it can change all the time so it's kind of frustrating let's land some big hits there since it's not doing anything for a moment plant some there there's another ground pound so we can hit it for free avoid the pecs avoid the swings I say when that happens you just run away from the ghost flame I wouldn't even bother attacking on that one just get away from it so it doesn't hit you and build up that Frost bites oh rolled a little early on that one there's the ground pound free moment to attack okay here's the death ritual spear attack again you need to avoid all this I just run away from the glowing spots and then I just start rolling to avoid the extra ones and master white did that attack when I was so far off but okay avoid the ghost flame avoid the ghost flame okay here's the explosion again let's hope it doesn't hit us okay I can't express enough how important it is to avoid the ghost flame on that attack because it is massive damage just absolutely incredibly high damage no don't die run away from the ghost flame Dodge to the left or right with that wave attack every single time now she's gonna keep repeating these same attacks over and over we just gotta wait for the right moment to be able to get in there for some attacks it's just a waiting game at this point it's already low health so it's just kind of sending all the ghost flame out at you it's gonna repeat the same thing for a while it's just a thing that happens with this fight quite often luckily it just gave us a couple of huge Windows to land some attacks very good and we go for the Finish I can't believe he just gave us three attacks which we can counter attack right at the end of the fight that's huge so those attacks that you just saw are the single best moments to strike when it does the jump attack and then pounds with its Feats and then when it tries to command grab you with the beak as long as you dodge it at the right time you can hit it for free outside of that the only other attack that I like to counter-attack on is when it holds the sword for the delayed attack and then strikes the ground those three attacks are your best moments to uh to go in on the deathrite birds and all the deathrite birds in the game do the same thing but they offer different loot this one gives you the death ritual spear the one over in kalid will give you the uh death's poker which is the weapon that they all feature and then the one over in consecrated snow field gives you the the ghost flame death sorcery which is pretty fun to use anyways guys I'm out of here for now I hope this video does help you deathrite birds are not easy you just gotta be patient and Outlast them thank you guys so much for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

Title: How To Defeat Commander Niall - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: umqyBmT3f_c
Transcript Text:
hey everyone thank you for tuning in for another Elder ring boss guide this time we're going in on Commander Nile up here in Castle Saul in the mountaintops area so this fight can be very tough but is very important as you do get the other half of the Haley tree Medallion after you defeat Commander Nile up here in the battlements so getting on the other side of this boss is very important to do if you want to go fight Melania later on now in this video I'm going to talk about the best moments to attack I'm going to talk about how to Parry as well as I'm going to talk about the right moments to roll with that said let's get started now you will see that he will summon two two guys alongside him two soldiers two banished Knights I like to run over here to the one on the right and immediately start attacking it as this is the tougher one of the two that are here basically I just bursted a bunch let him do his own combo and then I run in hit him again we just keep repeating the same cycle until it's dead I do recommend killing the one with two straight swords first as he is the tougher of the two they're a lot more aggressive and he does a lot more damage because he has two swords so once you get on the other side of that one you can focus on the next one here too this one's not as bad he fought this type of guy many times throughout the game at this point so you should be able to handle it they are tough all the same but it doesn't mean you can't do it you've already made it this far something else to keep in mind that you is that you can use bewitching branches on these banished Knights they will turn to your side and they will help you take out Commander Nile if you choose to do so I prefer to not I like to do the fight solo and so that's why I'm showing my tactics here now I was hoping you would not do that one specifically just like Commander O'Neal does over in the aeonian swamp of kwid Commander Nile will buff these guys as well so be aware of that it will increase their attack and defense but I would say if you are having a difficult time killing Niall I would say it's worth taking a moment to use bewitching branches after those uh those guys are either on your team or dead he will go into uh this phase where basically he activates his frostbite and electric attacks you can see that he'll jump up in the air he'll hit you with the prosthesis his uh his right leg is actually non-existent he has a bit of a uh a prosthetic leg and it does a lot of lightning damage when he slams it around on the ground you need to make sure that you dodge at the very last moment against him you can see here that he does have a dash and the dash itself is periable you can Parry the uh the halberd I did it a little early so I missed it but I'm gonna try to show it off anyway let's see if we can get him to do it again do another dash for me I want to Parry it I do recommend not parrying for that attack specifically but I want to show that it is possible [Music] and then of course his basic Halbert attacks are very periable too failing you miserably there you go the battle standard there is extremely periable so there is that option for you too Here Comes This attack I recommend just dodging you know better than I did there and then getting out of the way a lot of the time after that attack he'll do the uh the frost bite ground slam too so you want to make sure you're nowhere near him at that moment another Parry you can see that all of his basic attacks are variable here's the dash I failed to Parry sucks but it's fine it's fine here comes again there it is now if you're not doing parrying if you're just focusing on Magic you can just Spam your magic away it will make him dash at you a lot more but you can just kind of use your magic and just be done with it he doesn't Dodge because of how heavy he is so that's a thing too after he does use his big attack there where he just kind of goes crazy for a moment you're able to land a lot of damage on him because he's disabled for a moment he basically tires himself out which allows you to just really go ham on him for all the strikes possible and so that's something you can do there I do recommend though when he does that Dash Dodge out of the way he'll do the frostbite ground slam and then the a couple of slashes sometimes if he does the slashes that's when you can run in and land a couple hits too just like that and then you can back off just watch out for the the counter attack that he does there it's often that specific ground pound let's try that again this is one of the best moments to attack him if you're focusing on dodging and then you can just get out of way of get out of the way there and so those are the best moments to attack him and we have seen his entire move set already so there's nothing else to really talk about as far as his moves go I've already shown how to dodge them and when the right moments to attack are so let's just keep repeating the cycle until he's dead we land our attack we back off let me land another Perry let me show you the parries once again all of his basic attacks are indeed periable so you can just focus on that I got a little close for comfort there you see what I mean all of his basic attacks very periable diffusing of you know a carry-based weapon that's something you can very much so do with that said let's finish off with another big dodge attack so you can see that as well this is actually going really well this is exactly what I wanted to do here comes the slash we wait for it to finish we run in we hit them and if he's still alive at that point you just back off and repeat that cycle over and over again and then he turns into dust you have a sight of Grace here you get veterans prosthesis and then you can go up the stairs and you'll see a little bit of a path up to up an elevator up to the top of the battlements and you'll get the second half of the Haley tree Medallion upon defeating him now that that's over I wish you luck in this fight it can be very tough especially if you have a hard time with the banished Knights but you've already made it to this point in the game so you should be able to do it just fine just have patience fight him at the right times and get through this with that said I'm out of here for now thank you all for tuning in hope this does help you thank you for

Title: Roundtable Knight Vyke (Lord Contender's Evegaol) - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: MVA_v2oX5ac
Transcript Text:
hey everyone thank you for tuning in for another eldering boss guide this is actually my third take of this fight now this fight's really tough this is Lord vike that you can find up here at the contenders ever jail in the Mountaintop region this is Lord vyke before he succumbed to the flame of the frenzy so he doesn't do Madness damage in this fight he does a lot of Ancient Dragon Lightning basic lightning as well as storm damage uh you think you need to work work out most in this fight the thing you need to worry about most rather in this fight is his Ash of War it's the same idea as what we saw with the ash of War during his Madness very uh Madness variant of him except this time if he hits you with the first part of it it staggers you and he guarantees the second part of the hits which it does devastating damage so you just need to be careful it went 100 to zeros made so I have to be very careful to dodge it and I'm going to show how I can try to do that now just like with all other ever jails you can basically just run right at him and land a couple of hits so make sure you do that vike is very fast he has uh you know he has good armor and everything he's got good Poise but he's still pretty quick now he will buff his weapon with Ancient Dragon Lightning so be careful of that and he does get at least one hit one heel just like all other tarnished NPCs there's his lightning wave I recommend you know dodging to the left or right instead of going straight at him while he's doing this because it can actually uh it can hit you because it has a lot of good frames to it just going to keep running around not not getting hit by it not getting hit we go in all right he's full health and I am going to top my health off there's his act of War again let's run in for the hits we back up wait for him to try to cast a spell or something you'll see that when he gets lower Health he has more moves as well but he does stick to a basic few things in the first half of his health we'll talk about more of his abilities when we get there you see how much damage that one hit did to me one lightning did half my health that's crazy [Music] this is Ash of War again we run in after the wind goes away for a free hits he does have very high Poise so it's actually really hard to stagger him as well as you're seeing just trying to keep my distance from him as much as possible because his Ash of War does so much damage that if I you know if I stay too close he'll just basically one shot me despite all of my health and my armor stats he just does devastating damage ah there's that lightning half my health again it's the out of the way of the lightning guys Dodge to the side all right he should start opening up with more spells and stuff now he doesn't have a whole lot going on it's just uh one or two more things I believe yeah here it is these are the uh the witch Dragon Fortis ax moves where he takes the ancient dragon Lightnings uh spout Spears and just stabs them into the grounds that's essentially the idea there now you can get behind it while he's doing this and backstab him too if you can run in a bit of a circle towards him while he's casting that you can land a free critical hit there that is something I would recommend everyone to try to do you just need to make sure that you do it right and there's that ability right there just got hit by it he almost one shot made did you see I was near full health and he almost killed me straight out so you need to make sure you're very careful around this ash of War [Music] but now that we saw his entire move set that is my strategy to him if you are a spellcaster or an Archer you need to be very careful because it just makes him more aggressive and because he's a tarnished he can dodge around like crazy so if you're going to be doing that type of stuff just make sure that you're aware it's going to be hard to land those things the best thing you can do as far as Landing bow uh you know arrows goes is basically just do a quick roll and attack after he does something so when he goes to stab you with his spear your roll you tap R1 and repeat that same cycle because that's basically going to be your only window of opportunity to hit him with that type of stuff anyways guys I know this guy can be tough this is honestly for me the single toughest ever jail in the entire game so don't be afraid you know if you die if you need to practice it a few times that's completely normal just understand that this is for me in my opinion the single hardest ever jail in the entirety of Elden ring anyways I hope this video does help you thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

Title: How To Defeat Astel Stars of Darkness (and Naturalborn of the Void) - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: Fqo0FLxrJ3Q
Transcript Text:
hey everyone thank you for tuning in for another Elden ring boss guide this time we're going in on the second version of astal or another astel that you can find up here in the consecrated snow field at the yellow Annex tunnel this guide will apply as well to the version of vassal that you find by doing Ronnie's Quest so keep that in mind they're essentially the same thing but I wanted to talk about this one here because it is a little bit stronger and has a very special attack to it so let's talk about this when you went to the boss room here keep in mind that it will shoot a laser at you you can use these rock formations right here to block it if you're not good at dodging it I generally just advise you to dodge it because it saves a little bit of walking time but uh yeah that's possible too and then watch out for the tail whip and then immediately get in close and start hitting it in the face the face is the weak points you'll see that it does these nebula things we need to basically just stay out of the way of it it does have a lot of range and the explosions can do good damage so don't get hit by other either parts of that just you know roll forward or backwards I generally go backwards just to kind of recover when it does this twirl attack and nebulas at you if you run to your right at the same time you'll see that you can actually get a quick hit on the skull as well whenever whenever you see its hands start to glow like that right there it means it's going to do a ground pound as well so you need to make sure that you're ready for that too keep that in mind that is a moment where you just need to basically run away all right there's the teleport keep in mind the teleport can hurt you and then right here you can see how many of them oh it only did the one usually there's gonna be a whole bunch of them but that time there was only one that's the special special attack that's command grab attack that can do a ton of damage just need to make sure that you're ready for that I can't believe there was only one there was supposed to be several but all the same it's just like dodging the other version of it you just need to be ready for it okay here is a major attack where it just does a wide AOE and lifts you up and then throws you into the ground generally speaking if you see if you see [ __ ] starting to charge you want to just run back I did a terrible job dodging it there but if you run away from it then you'll be able to get out of range of it just fine if you do keep focusing on hitting its head you should be able to get a knock down before too long so keep that in mind too if you do get a knock down you can land a free critical hit on them so that's pretty good too and now he's going to start asteroiding this attack can do big damage but what you want to do is wait until you start seeing an asteroid coming directly at you and then just Spam roll just before one asteroid hits you if you time it perfectly you won't get hit by any of them at all that's the secret to dodging that attack there there's the ground pound we run away from it they run away from that problem solved here comes the tail whip again but we don't have to dodge because we're close enough got three big hits in there there's another charge attack you run away very good we move to the right oh and the nebula hit me unfortunate let's back up and heal you can see that astral stars of darkness is essentially the same thing as Natural Born of the Void but with a little bit more to it as far as the attacks that it can do with uh you know the slightly different asteroid as well as it'll have the teleport that can do a little bit more of a harder time to dodge because of the multiple versions of astel that'll try to grab you a Dodge timing is still the same but the multiple versions of him can throw you off so you need to be careful about that specifically Dodge the laser move back in watch the clamping of the jaw generally when you see him bite once he'll start to try biting you more and more you just need to be aware of that just try to keep it safe play safely stay away from it Dodge the teleports here comes the multiple grab Dodge its and that's what I'm talking about how there's a whole bunch of them there that can make it really difficult to dodge it's got to be very careful about it okay now he's charging this we need to run oh I was right on the edge literally on the edge of it if I ran half a second sooner I would have been safe but there's the tail attack the Stinger just stay out of range of it Dodge the laser go back in for more I generally say don't go don't go up and attack asphalt just to attack it I say you wait until it attacks and then you react to it a lot of players will just kind of run in and then just swing away and wonder why they're getting hit so much the reason is is because they're getting greedy if you react to its own attacks then you'll be able to just kind of you know counter react and hit some free damage there I do recommend being very safe don't get greedy with this fight as all these attacks can do big damage every single little bit that [ __ ] does just hurts a lot unless you have high magic resistance of course but most players don't do that anyways guys I hope this video does help you I know astral can be tough stars of darkness and natural born of the void a Mountain Natural Born of the Void both hit pretty hard for where you are in the game at that time just play it safe play it non-greedy play it patience and you'll be able to make it through the fight this one here as well drops a meteorite of [ __ ] which is a pretty cool gravity spell it's fun to use does good damage as well anyways guys I'm out of here for now I hope this video does help you thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

Title: How To Defeat Mohg, Lord of Blood - Elden Ring Boss Gameplay Guide
Video ID: r0IgQ9s6AEs
Transcript Text:
hey folks thank you for tuning in for another Elden ring boss guide this time we're talking about Moog now we are here at uh moog's pla Palace in his uh air area where he has Michela over there you can see mikola in his uh little egg womb thing yeah that's where he is uh but you're you know you're gonna see a cut scene here you probably have already seen the cutscene yourself when we let it play out while I describe the fight a little bit here okay this fight is something that you can do very early on in the game if you choose to but I choose to take it on late game because the fight can actually be pretty tough the good news about this fight is moog doesn't have a whole lot of resistances to a whole lot of things here the version you find of him in the Subterranean shunning grounds is just a projection of him so you don't have a whole lot of uh like Elemental or status effects that are useful against him there but here he's very weak to bleed frostbite you can use poison Scarlet rot on him as well all that stuff is applicable in this Arena against Mo because this is the actual real version of him he does have two phases so I'm going to describe the first phase real quick if you do have Moog shackle you can use it twice during this phase that is a possibility for you so if you do have it don't be afraid to use it because it just binds them to the ground and allows you to get a few free hits on them and in fact if you are struggling with this fight I would recommend doing so the next thing that you need to worry about is when he transitions to phase two The Curse that he applies to you is a blade curse so if you do have if you have done the fight against eleanora not only do you get a pull blade but you get the purifying red Crystal as well the purifying Crystal makes it so it negates majority of the damage from that phase transition so I would say make sure you have that equipped on your flask if you don't have it be prepared to use a ton of your Crimson flask to out heal the damage that applies here I would say if you don't have it make sure you go to the second Church of America defeat eleanora get that red Crystal equip it and it'll make the transition of this a lot easier because then you'll also be able to have hit him for a whole bunch of damage and negate a good amount of his healing now the first phase is essentially identical to the entire fight that you can find of him in the Subterranean shunning grounds so that's the easier part of this the second phase he has a whole bunch of blood flame that he throws everywhere and it does a ton of damage really quickly not to mention it leaves fire everywhere that can apply bleed like crazy as well so be ready to avoid all those areas on the ground as much as you possibly can ouch there's some more blood flame right there that's what I mean so let's go ahead and uh use the shackle this only works in the first half of the fight scenes and be very sure that you use it in the first half of the fight as much as possible it's time to the ground again oh you can't do it while he's doing the curse time to the ground again hit him a bunch for damage use their flask because now he's going to do the curse and then I like to get behind him and just hit him a whole bunch you can see that the damage I just applied negated all of his healing that he just did there and now he's below half health Barry jumps in the sky throws blood at you and then comes down on you starts throwing blood everywhere you just gotta try to find an open window to heal outside of that it's more of the same just dodging his combos making sure you're not getting hit by all of those swings like crazy just taking it very slow very methodical trying everything you can to not get hit by all this Blood flame as much as possible you'll find moments to attack in between all his stuff got to be a little patient for it that's all you see what I mean keep dodging this stuff and then you get wide open areas to attack him he actually like doesn't attack you for large amounts of time so you're able to land a whole bunch of damage whenever he's not attacking you uh the Dodge to the right on that but sometimes I just fail miserably like so oh I failed my role avoid that I probably should have just dodged but I wanted to heal through it just in case that I failed my role oh I rolled a little early but that's okay keep in mind that in the middle of a lot of his um his blood Flame claw attacks he will try to hit you with a swing immediately after she need to make sure that you play it a little bit on the safer side there try not to get hit by it just don't attack immediately after one of the blood Flame claw attacks just take it easy focus on the Dodge try to stay close to him as much as possible let him swing away use those wide open opportunities to land your attacks and that's Moog Lord of blood it can be a very tough fight but as long as you pace yourself and you attack on the right moments you could really simplify this fight what a lot of people will do and this is a major mistake is they will attack in the middle of his combos when you attack in the middle of moog's combos it just makes you take damage because you can't Dodge while you're attacking a lot of time you have to wait for the animation so as long as you play a patient and wait for those wide open windows that he gives you to really apply your damage it really simplifies the fight like I said anyways dudes I hope this video does help you I know it can be tough but you just gotta remember keep it patient roll at the right times and counter-attack in those wide open windows with that said I'm out of here for now thank you for tuning in thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

Transcript Text:
hey folks thank you for tuning in for another Elder ring boss guide this time it's all about Godfrey and horrorlu this is a two-phase fight where he does transform into his original form as Hora Lou when he's got all that bloodlust going on I like to call him Macho Man Randy Savage that's what he reminds me of but that is what this fight is all about now I'm gonna simplify this fight really quick before we go in I like to think of it like this you dodge towards his left leg and in between his combos when he's done swinging you can hit him real quick that's pretty much the entirety of phase one outside of a couple things and then for phase two the moments where you hit them are in like just after he does his command grab attacks he has a couple different moves where he tries to grab you and he'll try to like slam you into the ground and stuff if you dodge that it'll leave him open for a quick attack or maybe even two or three if you're fast enough and so I'm gonna really highlight that during this fight with that said let me uh seppuku to lay down the big damage and get this started this is my first playthrough ever using this much bleed stuff before and I'm not gonna lie I can see why people use it like crazy now watch I'm gonna Dodge towards his left leg and it's gonna be it's gonna be good for us it's gonna be very good left leg left leg left leg [Music] left leg left leg left leg action okay when you see him twirl his ax over his head and then slam the ground you basically need to run away at that point because he's doing the big ground slam so it's pretty easy to get away from once you get used to the idea again stay on that left leg guys stay on that left leg as much as possible left leg action I got smacked let me heal up a twirl over the head so we need to leave Dodge it just like that all about that left leg action baby we are big fans of Godfrey's left leg in this channel fans there's the Toro we need to back up [Music] all right let's lure him back to the center he's about to go phase two here he'll also do this attack right here if you watch the base of his ax the handle of the ax as soon as it hits the ground or just before it hits the ground that's when you want to jump this is like a mini phase two inside of phase one it's overall not that big of a deal you just need to make sure that you jump or Dodge just as the handle of the ax hits the ground so that way the wave doesn't hit you and then all the Stomps become like large weight large wave attacks which means no matter where you are in the arena they can hit you do you just need to make sure that you dodge carefully unfortunately sirash goes down here if you don't know the lore sirash is actually responsible for maintaining Godfrey's bloodlust [Music] so when Godfrey does want to go full bloodlust mode he unfortunately has to get rid of Suraj he has to sacrifice him in order to do so sad boy hours can I get an F in the comment section for sirash please thank you poor guy poor Kitty and like I said at the beginning of this video specifically the second phase of this fight you really want to focus on hitting him after he tries to grab you it is something you have to get used to it has a very delayed delayed Dodge to it but once you get used to it you're going to find that those are the best moments to strike him it doesn't mean that you know you can strike him at other times but those are the single best moments too and I'm going to highlight that I'm going to defeat him with that tactic so that way you understand I try to make these guys at these guys as new player friendly as possible and I like to highlight the moments in which it makes the most sense to attack so let's do that with this fight as horrorlu glorious let's do this he's gonna open up with a command grab we want to dodge and then strike Dodge strike him a couple times and they'll be back off from here we just wait for more command grabs you'll see he has a whole bunch of different combos that he can do lots of ground Stomps lots of Swing of his feet and hands a lot of jumps and pounces here's a command grab we Dodge it we hit him he has the scream as well that can hit you but it doesn't do damage and then he has the ground pound which you do need to jump or Dodge out of the way of that it hits the ground twice here's another command grab we Dodge we hit him we back up now this is the same thing as phase one where he hits the ground with the handle of his ax it's the same idea here if you are close enough in that moment you can actually hit him at the end of that as well so that's the thing too keep in mind as you can see the roar does no damage but we keep hitting him after his command grabs and that's allowing me to do a lot of damage to him with minimal risk from there once he turns into the mini Phase 2 in the major phase two where he just makes all the waves of damage everywhere you just need to jump over those or Dodge through them and wait for the command grab attacks to finish him off that's pretty much what this fight is from there I just keep running away from him we Dodge attack I got a little greedy there but it's fine he tried to command grab me again that heel was worth it just wait for more command grabs you're jumping over the waves here's command grab now we Dodge we strike we back off here's the ground pounds get out of the way of fats wait for more command grab attacks guys here it comes we hit him we back off we just repeat this cycle until he's dead over and over and over there's command grab we hit him real quick we back off very good here another command grab we finish him off and that's the game as you can see as long as you focus on those command grab attacks I know I'm saying it doesn't even sound like a real combo of words anymore command grab command grab but as long as you keep dodging those attacks and then counter-attacking him once that animation is over you can land a lot of free damage on them and then just run away keep yourself alive that's how you take out horror loo easily with that said folks I hope this video does help you I know it's a lot to take in in a short amount of time but it is worth practicing those specific moments anyways thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

Transcript Text:
hello everyone thank you for tuning in for another eldering boss guide this time we're covering magma worm Macar you can find him at the very top of the ruined strewned precipice and its own dungeon up here by the Overlook basically you go up a bunch of wooden catwalks through a cave up some Cliffs and elevators and you'll find yourself all the way up here in a room with a giant magma worm now you do have a rather large Arena here but there's a bunch of ruins in here so they can kind of be a little bit weird the biggest thing you need to work out for when it comes to fighting a magma worm is what I call the Zoomies which he's doing right now he charges at you with Magma flowing out of his mouth and leaves a trail of it while running around like crazy if you have a dog or a cat or a ferret or a mouse or a rat anything like that then you understand what the Zoomies are imagine that but giant magma worm okay it's scary it's terrifying you don't want to get hit by it what you want to do here is in between its attacks just focus on hitting it on the head it does swing its sword around like crazy but if you can find moments to strike it in the head in between its own moves you'll be able to do a lot of damage really quickly now you'll only be able to hit him in the head for the first half of the fight unfortunately I got hit by the Zoomies because during the second half of the fight he does stand up which is a bit of a problem we'll talk about that once we get there because we can do a lot of damage with a couple of his sword swings which can be uh pretty Troublesome to deal with let's avoid the fire keep hitting him in the head okay he went phase two he's standing up on his hind legs the biggest thing you need to look out for with the hind legs is he throws fire everywhere At His Feet as well as he can throw fire at a range and then his sword actually goes aflame and he has these crazy sword attacks like this or he spins in a circle slams it into the ground he can do a very powerful charged attack let's even get him to do it he'll wield the sword with two hands and just smash the ground with it which is actually really hard to time a proper Dodge with I'm not gonna kill him until I can get him to do it there it is oh no that wasn't the right one that was just a basic swing there's another couple basic swings do the charge attack friend and you should do the charged attack buddy do it do it for the friends no I need you to show them can you show them the thing there it is you see how he charges it up and then slams The Ground really hard it's a bit delayed so it can be difficult to dodge be aware as well this giant pillar in the middle he can hit you through because the sword is so large so be aware of that too anyways how I counteract phase two is I basically just get right underneath them I just go right underneath them I attack his tail and then he turns around he does the charge sword attack again you see how much damage that did because I failed that Dodge Here Comes again he can kill you very quickly and easily with that so you have to be very very careful basically basically I just get underneath them and hit the base of his tail over and over until he dies if I can manage to not get hit long enough to do so anyway and there you go that covers magma where mccar this is the very magma worm as well that drops the magma worm scale sword which if you're into curved grade swords is a pretty fun weapon to use and of course he does drop a dragon heart for you to use as well if you're into Dragon communion incantations this is one you want to take out so you can get more of those spells going but anyways guys I hope this video helped you thank you for tuning in thank you for liking commenting and subscribing and I'll see you soon for more

Title: How To Defeat Tree Sentinel - Elden Ring
Video ID: 1Fl5YBm7pXw
Transcript Text:
hey guys welcome to the channel in this video i want to discuss how i took down the tree sentinel that you find very early on in the game now my general advice to you at the very beginning of the game is to avoid this fight for a while you very well can take it down early if you are a good player at this type of game but generally speaking this is a type of fight that is not easy for most people to take on straight up and that's normal that's just very normal they just kind of threw this boss at people that enjoy an early game challenge i feel he is a very cool looking boss but all the same it's not really intended to be fought early on without extreme difficulty now the big attack you want to look for here is when the horse leaps right here and then he does an overhand attack and then a poke or an underhand and then generally speaking he will end his attack after just two of those attacks there but sometimes it'll lead into two or three different types of combos where the horse will rear up and then stomp after a short delay or he will go for another overhand attack as you can see by watching the video you'll see more and more of his attacks but you can often stop his combo after just two of the swings if you actually dodge towards the back end of the horse which gives you not only an opportunity to attack but to avoid the tree sentinel's damage as well if you just watch what i do here oftentimes when i dodge towards the back end of the horse i can get two catch flame hits in and then roll away scot-free now that is the best window of opportunity to attack that i found as a person that's playing the prophet class you can probably find other ways to attack if you're playing like a melee character or something like that but as you can see here i'm just able to basically pull this attack you know just kind of draw this attack out of the tree sentinel land two hits of the catch flame for free and then get out my second bit of advice with this fight is to make sure that you stay on the axe or halberd side of the tree sentinel when you go on his shield side he just kind of does these weird slams that you will see i get hit by a couple times towards the end uh they do really high damage but also as you can see the aoe is so big that if you're in there even if you're blocking you're probably gonna get sent flying and take damage anyway it's just not really worth it even for a very strong melee based character so i would just advise stay on the side of the halberd get good at dodging the axes learn the animations and then basically just land your free shots after he keeps doing this very easy to dodge animation here uh with that said that's pretty much all i have for you in this video i hope you enjoyed it i hope these uh these tips for the tree sentinel do help if you do get help out of this video do me a favor leave a like on it so youtube will recommend it to more people that may be looking for it and i'll see you guys soon for more [Music] you

Title: How To Defeat Flying Dragon Agheel and Obtain Dragon Heart
Video ID: DaIINpQH_dw
Transcript Text:
hey everyone welcome to the channel in this video i wanted to talk about the boss fight with the dragon at the lake in the very uh very early game that you can you know run across even on accident when you do cross this lake you'll see a bit of a bonfire going on with a bunch of uh zombie-like dudes hanging out around it and when you go near it a dragon swoops in the flying dragon uh agile i'm assuming it's pronounced i may be pronouncing that wrong correct me if i'm wrong but yeah so after a few tries with this boss i found that the easiest way to fight it was actually from horseback which does make sense considering the size of the field here and how large the dragon is um i'm playing the prophet class here as you can see so one of my main attacks is actually a fire attack i have flame sling and then i have uh the shorter range fire burst attack so i really can't do much with the to the dragon with it so i figured i would just ride it right in with the spear that the game gives you with the beginning of the prophet class as well so as you can see here i'm just kind of avoiding the dragon's fire riding around and when it is on the ground after an attack i go up and poke it with the spear two or three times and then i back right off if you do stay near the dragon too long it'll fly up in the air as you can see there and then lunge at you like that and so when he does that when he lands you can another few attacks in now you do have to be careful because as you just saw right there if you stay too long as well he will tail swipe you and at least for me the tail swipe does one shot me it'll kill the horse instantly and my character right away when you do ride near the face you can see he goes for a bit of a uh a bite there there's that tail swipe again so make sure you avoid the bite for me pretty much everything the dragon does one shots um so you just pretty much have to avoid all the attacks and that's why i do recommend using the horse because you can get in and out of fights really quickly outside of that the dragon will fly around spreading fire once in a while and sometimes he'll fly straight up and then blow fire directly underneath him like you can see here so there's a lot of different attacks he can do but they all are rather easily avoidable when you're on the horse so please do yourself a favor if you're looking to get through this fight make sure you are riding the horse go in for a couple of swings with your whatever your weapon is and then get out uh there's a stomp i was uh not ever hit by the stomp i it took me four attempts to take this guy down the stump is the only thing that didn't hit me uh as you can see here his flame breath does have incredibly long range so you have to make sure that you stay away from that uh from there though the fight is pretty straightforward you've seen pretty much all his attacks already he has already put out everything he has to offer and he's actually most vulnerable when he's mid fire breath on the ground here because you can just kind of get in and out very very safely with that said guys if this video does help you do me a favor and leave a like on it so that way it'll be recommended to more like-minded folks spread the word about how actually easy this flying dragon agile boss fight is with that said as well if you're having trouble with some other bosses in the game i do have some other guides you'll be able to find on my channel so don't be afraid to subscribe and check those out as well with that said guys i'm out of here for now thank you so much for watching and i'll see you soon for more [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign

Title: How To Defeat Grave Warden Duelist and Find Battle Hammer
Video ID: Ibu62cncWnE
Transcript Text:
hey guys welcome to the channel in this video i want to do a quick guide on how to get the battle hammer from the grave warden duelist as you can see we're about to enter the arena with the grave warden duelist here i'll show you here on the map uh basically you just need to go to the river and follow it straight north to the mark water catacombs if you go straight east from the gate front ruins you'll find the river just go in the water and just get on your horse and follow it all the way up you'll find a door call the murk water catacombs you open it up you go in you fight your way to to the final room here and then you take on the great warden duelist now let's talk about the grave warden duelist really quick as you can see he has two battle hammers he does mostly horizontal attacks and he does expose his back to you with a lot of his attacks as well so if you're a melee based build make sure you get behind him and just swing away like crazy you'll be able to land a bunch of damage he doesn't have that much health but he also seems to be rather susceptible to fire so if you are the prophet class or if you have any fire capabilities whatsoever just keep hitting him it's fairly simple it's not so bad most of his attacks are horizontal i'm not sure if you can parry him but i would not doubt it based on how simple some of his first few swings are as you can see though most of his combos are mostly horizontal and then end with vertical strikes uh from there though be aware when he is below 50 health and you'll see this in just a moment he will enrage it's like a second form uh you know phase two if you will so when he does that he does hit even harder and he swings a lot more which he already swings a lot but he swings even more but with that said you can get up behind him still it's basically the same fight he just does a little bit more damage so basically you can see here i just nuke him with the fire in just a moment here just to get rid of him really fast because he seems susceptible to it and then from there you get the battle hammer which is a very very good early game strength based weapon i believe it costs 26 strength and eight dexterity to wield which if you are going for a strength build this is a very good item you can find extremely early in the game you can actually go straight to this and do this fight right away if this video helped you leave a like on it so that way youtube will recommend it to more like-minded folks and i'll see you guys soon for more

Title: How To Defeat Crucible Knight - Elden Ring
Video ID: X6Oh0STKmrA
Transcript Text:
hey guys welcome to the channel for another elden ring boss fight guide uh this one can be found at the storm hill evergowl this one is called the crucible night and is actually a very difficult fight at least it was for me as the prophet class but i did find a couple windows of opportunity which i will discuss uh to kind of hit him with a flame sling or any other arranged ability now keep in mind this is the from the perspective of the profit class i'm sure there's several other ways to make this easier for other classes but this was the easiest way that i found to take him down using the flame sling ability that you can get fairly early on in the game now as you can see here he has all sorts of different melee attacks as well as aoe ground strikes that just hit me right there he has many different types of swings and he does have actually three different phases albeit they're very similar but they do get a little bit more uh he does get more attacks as time goes on through these phases uh at 33 and 66 damage taken on the boss he will gain additional attacks which you will see throughout this fight and it will discuss how how i dodged them now the two windows of opportunity that i found to attack first and foremost he has that aoe ground strike it looks like a little bit of an earthquake that you'll see pretty often and i'll counter attack during that during that time with flame sling now the big difference here is he has two different variants of this attack the first one being he still holds his sword and shield out while he does it that's not the one you want to counter attack on here the one you want to counter attack on here is when he dual will uh when he two hands his sword which leaves his shield down and open for full damage of your attack now you'll see in just a moment here here comes where he holds the sword with two hands and then does another swing on top of it that's when i throw the flame sling and hit him for 157 damage now from there i just continue dodging that's the first opportunity i could find to attack him the next one is when he does a bit of a backhand drag attack with the sword right here now that leaves him pretty open to attack as you can see and i hit him with another fireball there the thing to watch out for that one is if you stand too close he will do an overhand swing and hit you for free while you're in the animation just like you saw there that same attack will happen after that ground drag but basically this whole fight is just me trying to lure out this animation from him right here again you see that one i didn't anticipate that one so i just dodge rolled now he is about to enter that first phase change going into the second phase where he actually gains a very angelic ability actually reminds me of the valkyries in god of war very very cool looking attack where he sprouts wings and then dives at you with his sword you do need to dodge that ability you have to get out of the way of that as for me it almost one shots my character here i am taunting him a little bit but anyway uh i i had been fighting this boss for about an hour and then when i finally found what works for me i was very happy because i knew that this fight was going to be the one but anyway uh throughout the fight albeit very slowly and these bosses are pretty tough so i just take take my time with them now here comes his uh next phase oh maybe not yet i anticipated too early for some reason on this fight he didn't do it when he should on the other times i fought him and got him to this point in the in health he already was doing his additional attacks but he didn't hear for some reason i think maybe because he connected damage there he just kind of delayed it but anyway it'll be here after this attack i believe this next hit he'll sprout wings and then dive at me you do have to be careful when you go to dodge this attack though if you do it too or early or too late then he will hit you as you can see there here are the wings he dives at you just like the valkyries would and then he does a quick stance he has a very quick recovery and i tried to hit him there myself with a fireball and it didn't work out for me unfortunately so we're still stuck with the two uh the two basic windows of opportunity here to strike him now later on in the video you'll see that he does gain a little bit of a tailspin attack after that dive he will also do a tail spin at the end of other combos or even at the beginning of other combos as well it looks like a dragon's tail where he'll just do a quick spin with it and it's an aoe and it's pretty generous and then his in his final third phase he will actually have that same attack but a much wider aoe it covers probably a good third of the entire little arena here that we're fighting in it's a very wide attack and you have to dodge roll it you can't block it you can't parry it you have to dodge roll it i think a lot of it has to do with it being magic damage but all the same that is something that i uh i want to share with you guys now outside of that personally i just dodge all of his attacks if i'm not counter-attacking i do nothing but dodge roll even if i think i'm out of the out of range a lot of time i'll still dodge roll because for some reason his sword hit me a couple times in previous fights when i was out of range now what you do get out of the uh the fight here when it's over you actually get the tailspin attack yourself and it does scale on faith which is really great it does great damage and i do a little bit of a showcase for this attack at the end of the video there it is right there you actually get that attack yourself if you defeat him so that's very very cool if you'd like to see that you can scroll to the end of the video and watch that yourself but otherwise i will leave you to watch the rest of this fight hopefully you learn from it hopefully this video helps you if it does do leave a like on it share it with other people because i know this is one of the harder fights in the game at the beginning for most people that i've seen play this game so far so if i can help others by showcasing how i took it down and also don't be afraid to share how you took it down in the comments because i'm not playing a melee based character i'm playing a spellcaster essentially a prophet he's kind of a hybrid with the cipher patta but all the same uh when i fight bosses like this i generally go for the uh the safer range because if i get hit i take a lot of damage but anyways i'm gonna stop talking now enjoy the rest of the video i hope it helps i will see you guys soon for more [Music] [Music] so you

Title: How To Defeat Mad Tongue Alberitch and Find Cipher Pata
Video ID: yB-Wrs-3BP8
Transcript Text:
hey guys welcome to the channel once again in this video i'm covering a little bit of how to take down mad tongue albridge as well as obtaining a very cool faith-based weapon afterward this this fight is extremely tough it took me upwards of an hour to actually get it to be fair though i know i had only leveled up once as you can see i have a bunch of runes that i've not spent uh but i just found that you can just pretty much spam him with a bunch of fire right out the gate and do nearly a thousand damage right away uh obviously if you do take damage he does cause some status effects like bleed and frostbite so keep that in mind as well but also keep in mind that mad tongue albrecht can heal as well he only heals once but still that's something that heals over over 900 health for him as well so a couple of his attacks he has the scythe of course which he can wield with one hand or with two hands and he has several different attacks both horizontal and vertical with those so what i choose to do here is pretty much keep my distance all the while um after that he'll have the uh frost attacks he has the you know the little frost missiles that fly at you they're very easy to dodge you only have to strafe to one side or the other but be not be aware that if they do hit you they do hit a lot for a lot of damage so keep that in mind and then his final attack is a little bit of a aoe frost attack that builds up frostbite on you when you stand in it so make sure to avoid it because it builds up really quickly as well so basically uh after the initial salvo of fire what i do here is i just avoid him and only poke him with my spear after he does a little flourish attack right here i'll be able to land two or three quick hits and then i back right off again and just avoid him until he does that flourish again as that's the best window of opportunity i found actually hit him now keep in mind as well that this is from the perspective of an extremely low level profit class in game so i'm just kind of going with what i have from there as you can see here it's very easy to dodge those ice missiles very easy to dodge most of his attacks but all of his attacks do hit for a lot of damage so be aware of that now when you do take him down you can go into the back room and get yourself a little bit of an item called the cipher pata now it is a faith-based weapon it requires 30 faith to wield it effectively i don't have my own faith quite built up to that last i played it with it's at 28 so i will be able to see the actual effectiveness of this fist based faith weapon soon but all the same i found it back there and wanted to enlighten everyone else in case you happen to missed it or if you don't know where it is and you're looking for it then here you go if this video helped you whether it came to finding this item or defeating that npc do leave a like on it so that way youtube will recommend it to more like-minded folks and don't be afraid to subscribe for more not only guides to elden ring but more streams as well thank you guys for watching and i'll see you soon for more [Music] so you

Title: How I Defeated Consort Radahn (With 2 Different Builds)
Video ID: iRAGmZ-MP9k
Transcript Text:
I've now defeated the final boss of Elden ring shadow of the earth tree twice with two completely different builds and tactics during my live streams of these fights I died repeatedly but you guys know me when I met with a challenge I don't give in I kept jumping back into the fight to learn how to Parry Dodge and Counterattack at the right moments in this video I'm including both of my victories over Ron and Shadow of the earth tree and hopes that it's able to help others defeat him while these fights aren't perfect and while this isn't meant to be a guide it shows that he is defeatable with and without parrying and with and without burst of damage from things like bleed and Frostbite for my first playthrough of shadow of the UR tree I decided to kind of Go free form and just re spe a bunch of times till I found something that I enjoyed using the most and so this is what I ended up with I have the backhand blade at plus 25 and I set it to the blood affinity as you can see at the bottom it says it causes blood loss buildup 114 I'll show you exactly why that is take note of the attribute scaling strength dexterity and Arcane the Arcane is actually the key for this I do have the buckler here this is the playthrough in which I decided to try to Parry some stuff including redon I do have the dragon communion seal and I do have uh one of the new incantations but I didn't actually use that at all in this fight so just ignore that I do have the armor of Knight set on just because it looks so damn good and then we have the two-headed turtle Talisman The Golden Braid Crimson seed Talisman plus one and dragon Crest Shield Talisman plus two I decided to go a more utility and defensive aspect in this fight because a lot of my damage was actually pretty good without any actual extra Buffs from talismans just because of the specifically the blood loss buildup you'll see that it adds up for a lot of damage really fast I do have all of my flasks set to Crimson tear I didn't get plus4 in the base game so I just have 13 here and then in my flask of Wonders physic I have Dex knot and strength knot just for a little bit of extra extra damage I wasn't really comfortable using anything else there so that is just what I have going on now for my stats you can see that I am level 191 but the DLC does give a lot of experience so you'll probably end up if you do a full base game playthrough and expansion playr you will likely end up somewhere around this level as well you can see that I do have 65 Vigor that's a big one uh 29 endurance another big one strength is 38 dexterity 65 and Arcane 65 remember what I said earlier the Arcane is a big thing there even though it's only descaling on the weapon that's actually the the deciding factor on how much blood loss buildup the weapon has if the weapon scales on Arcane at all then Arcane is the big factor there so pay attention to that when you make your own your your own build then of course the main the main physical damage aspect ECT from there is the dexterity it does have B scaling so the you know that's where a lot of the damage comes from otherwise another thing to note here is that while I do have godric's great Rune selected I did not use any Rune arcs during any of these fights just because it would be something I would have to farm so many of them so I just did not actively use that at all all la [Music] [Music] [Music] damn that attack is insane [Music] [Music] [Music] all right here we go where you coming from yeah running worked okay okay cool all right hold hold hold hold yeah yeah for my second build you can see that I'm wearing all the Death Knight stuff I really liked the uh the death knights in the expansion and I do have a death knight playthrough of the base game as well that even though they are themed differently I decided to transform the my original death knight character into a DLC death knight character and this is the equipment I went in with the death Knight's long half axe plus 10 you can see that it's mostly scaling on strength but it has a little bit of faith and deck in there as well does some extra lightning damage I do have the finger seal but keep in mind I did not use any incantations during this fight that was just something that I was trying out the new Death Knight incantation with all the lightning bolts and then I have the death knight armor set here looks great I really love the aesthetic of this and then we have the two-headed turtle Talisman Dragon Crush Shield Talisman plus two Golden Braid and then the two-handed sword Talisman I decided to go more utility and defensive on this one again but changing it up a little bit to use the two-handed sword Talisman to really help with my my damage considering I wasn't using things like bleed on this run the two-handed sword Talisman gave me that extra oomph behind my my hits you can see I have all 14 flasks set to Crimson tear I don't use any Ash of War business here or incantations during this fight either and then I have the flask of wondrous physics set to the lightning shrouding crack tier and strength not Crystal tier again for more physical enlightening damage while it's active for my stats here you can see again Shadow tree blessing level 18 just like my first playr my Vigor is 60 that's a big one uh endurance 20 s strength 60 and Faith 60 those are all the major stats needed here for this the faith less is less important that's more for the incantation side of things but the weapon does scale a little bit on it so it's a small help there but the main thing is Vigor endurance and strength for this build a side note as well both Shadow tree blessings are 18 for both of these runs and I believe the max is 20 so this is something that you know I could have gone exploring for more to get the last two levels but I didn't really feel that it was important for the fight overall it's something that you don't have to be perfectly maxed out to actually be capable of completing but also we found out that Mika gave us uh gave us torrent so that way we could do certain things so that way his own ends could be met as well such as killing redon and Moog that just kind of shows how manipulative manipulative he can be even though we gain something big out of it like torrent he didn't do it out of the kindness of his heart [Music] [ __ ] [Music] 1 2 3 4 Roll and Roll too damn early again I hate myself [ __ ] nice not nice [Music] got in a cheeky jump R2 there another cheeky jump bar too that was some excellent trading chat let's go 1 2 3 4 5 ah I failed it miserably recovered though recovered we're fine let's talk my way through this excellent roll excellent news oh he's jumping away so for this I just I just [ __ ] run when he does this I just run I don't know how effective this is we'll see how it goes running is good [Music] so it looks like once he jumps in the sky just run away 3 4 5 roll it I failed it again son of a [ __ ] heal heal heal we're good we roll backward counter R1 roll it R1 fail we're recovering we're recovering I [Music] failed [ __ ] not great heal heal we're good we're covered we're safe that attack sucks everything roll roll roll big roll two r1's roll roll roll R1 roll it gorgeous roll roll roll big roll two r1s roll it R1 Panic roll that attack I guess Max Health we're almost there get right underneath his ass here we can land a Charged R2 with this wait for it charge R2 nail it roll roll dead let's [Music] go we pick that fight apart piece by piece the secret to both phase one and phase two guys if you're not parrying never stay in front of him that's the secret never stay in front of him it it's one problem in the first phase if you stay in front of him then he pulls off some of his faster attacks right but in phase two if you stay in front of him he does all that Holy lightning after every single swing if you stay in front of him there's a chance you can hit by get hit by it a lot of his attacks if you do stay in front of him will actually still miss the holy lightning but let's be honest most people absent-mindedly are going to put a little bit of space from his hit boox right a little bit if you do hug him you can make it so most of that misses you but that also puts you in a poor position for counterattacking because just like phase one that means this his attacks are going to hit you that much faster so the secret is roll to his sides the only time that you don't roll to his sides are when he does the gravity Spin Attack and he's coming at you cuz you can roll that and then get two big r1s in and when he's going for the grab don't roll to his sides on that attack roll backward cuz it puts you in a better position to ground up the next thing there's enough time after that attack to where you can land in R1 and then reset your mental and get ready for the next combo I hope that my experience of getting wrecked by redon and finally defeating him is able to give you some insight on how you too can defeat him while this fight is tough you can overcome it with some patience and willingness to learn if you'd like to see the full playthroughs of one or both of my builds in Shadow of the earth tree so far click on the videos you see on screen now until next time be excellent to each other
