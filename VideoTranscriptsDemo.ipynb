      "\n",
      "To defeat Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, the key strategy involves breaking the aura of her students in phase one. You need to hit the student with a glowing aura once to reveal Rennala. Repeat this process for three students to drop Rennala's health significantly. Avoid killing all the students before breaking the aura, as it could lead to more chaotic positioning in the arena. Once you've reduced half of Rennala's health, prepare for the second phase by buffing your weapon and attacking aggressively to finish her off in the same manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommended Equipment and Abilities for Defeating Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Spirit Ashes**: Summoning wolf spirit ashes is highly recommended when facing Rennala. This allows for consistent staggering against her.\n",
      "2. **Bleed Weapons**: Upgrading a melee weapon that can inflict bleed damage is beneficial for defeating Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon.\n",
      "3. **Holy Damage**: If available, using holy damage can also be quite effective against Rennala.\n",
      "4. **Health Flasks**: Stock up on health flasks for the fight with Rennala, as you will need them more than mana flasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Tips for Melee Builds Against Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon\n",
      "\n",
      "For melee builds attempting to defeat Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, the best approach is to upgrade your melee weapon to at least +6 and incorporate abilities like Bloody Slash. Position yourself effectively by having spirit wolves on one side and yourself on the other to maximize damage without taking too much damage in return. Remain aggressive and utilize dodge mechanics to avoid her attacks while continually attacking Rennala.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Tips for Ranged Builds Against Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon\n",
      "\n",
      "For ranged builds, be aware that direct magic attacks may not be as effective against Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, since she has magic resistance. Instead, consider switching to more direct melee strategies or using a melee weapon with special abilities. If you choose to summon spirit ashes, wait for Rennala to cast her beam attack before summoning to avoid being hit. Focus on dodging her spells and positioning yourself to minimize damage while attacking when possible.\n"
